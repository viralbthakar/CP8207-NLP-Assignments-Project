Objective:

The basic goals of assignment 3 are (1) question answering pairs which can represent your data set; 2) a QA webpage that can be publicly accessible.

Requirements:

An updated and complete data set is required to submit and you will specify how you update your data set in your presentation.
How to generate your question-answering pairs? How to extend your pairs if more data will be added in? How to make a high quality pair? There must be a mythology to support your pairs
A webpage to show your QA pairs: you can create a static one to show your pairs only; or you can let your users generate their own question and then your system provides the answer(s) in 3 seconds, beside the static page. The latter is an optional one. You will gain your big bonus if you can achieve it.
Marking scheme: depends on the richness/organization/preprocessing/rationale of the assignment. The marks will also reflect my/your ranking when we watch the presentations. 

Note:

This is a piece of research-related work. No standard answer will be existed. You are right as long as you are reasonable. So don't be afraid to be creative!
