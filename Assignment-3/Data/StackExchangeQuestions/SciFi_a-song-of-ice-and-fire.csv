"205669","Why did Tywin never remarry?","<p>With all of Tywin Lannister's talk of protecting the family legacy why did he never remarry after the death of his wife? He was still relatively young at the time and there are examples of older lords taking new brides.</p>

<p>It seems odd that he wouldn't try for more children seeing as he believes only Jaime is a suitable heir to Casterly Rock. It may be that he didn't want to create alternate claimants to the Rock but that seems like weak reasoning. Especially considering how he sought to wed Cersei to Loras intending, in part, for her to have more children.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> And lastly, why didn't Lord Tywin ever remarry after his wife died?
  Surely he would have had ample opportunities to do so? Thanks.</p>
  
  <p><strong>GRRM:</strong> Maybe he didn't want to. <br><sub><a href=""https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/POVs_and_the_Red_Viper"" rel=""noreferrer"">Citadel: SSM - POVS AND THE RED VIPER</a></sub></p>

<p>You have to know the background of Tywin's marital life to understand why he may not have wanted to remarry. </p>

<p>Tywin married his cousin Joanna Lannister even though such a marriage brought no political advantages to House Lannister. Why? Because he loved her. He never loved anything more than her. Given <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/128378/54887"">his childhood and formative years</a>, Tywin had grown to despise laughter and viewed it with suspicion. Yet he laughed with Lady Joanna, her and her alone. It was often said at the court that Lord Tywin might rule the seven Kingdoms (As Aerys' Hand) but it was Lady Joanna who ruled him. The last joy went out of Tywin with Joanna's last breath and he never so much as smiled again. </p>

<p>Tywin already had three children so he didn't need to remarry to sire heirs. Even if he hadn't had children, House Lannister survived through his brothers. So getting more children was probably not a huge concern for him, especially since <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/129605/54887"">childbirth had cost him the love of his life</a>. So in short, he never moved on from Joanna and he simply had no wish to remarry at all. </p>

<p>Of course he was no stranger to whores after Joanna's death (Shae's one example). There are theories among the fandom that the secret tunnel from Tower of the Hand to Chataya's brothel may have been dug on Tywin's orders, allowing him to visit whores in secrecy. Given how he despised whores and those who frequented them, publicly, he could hardly become a patron openly. But it seems all that was limited to physical base needs, not because he ever wanted to have a woman again in his life.</p>

"66003","Was A Song of Ice and Fire inspired by Chinese History, and if yes, to what extent?","<p>I have noticed a few striking parallels between China's history and George R. R. Martin's epic fantasy, ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Ice Wall resembles the Great Wall of China. Both are meant to keep out the ""outsiders""</li>
<li>The Chinese tended to view themselves as the center of the world, and view the others as uncivilized and barbarians. In the same way the people from the Seven Kingdoms in the series view everything outside the Wall as ""the Others"". </li>
<li>Seven Kingdoms fighting among one another for the Iron Throne, this closely resembles the Seven Kingdom in China during <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_and_Autumn_period"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Spring and Autumn period</a>. </li>
<li>Dragonstone. In the series, ""<a href=""http://www.bustle.com/articles/23255-china-heavily-censored-game-of-thrones-this-might-be-why"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">We learn that the Targaryens once ruled all of Westeros until a rebellion, punctuated by a few hideous slaughters, chased them to a small, craggy isle off the coast called Dragonstone</a>"" This description reminds me of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Kuomintang#1945.E2.80.9349"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kuomingtang's retreat to Taiwan</a> in 1949.</li>
</ol>

<p>My question is, to what extent A Song of Ice and Fire was (and is) inspired by Chinese History?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","66005","<ol>
<li><p>The idea of the Wall was inspired <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian%27s_Wall"" rel=""nofollow"">Hadrian's Wall</a>, but resembles a lot the Great Wall of China.</p></li>
<li><p>I think a lot of ancient civilizations believed that they were the center of the world. For instance, this also happened in ancient Greece. They thought that everyone else was a barbarian. The word 'barbarian' comes from the Greek word 'Βάρβαρος' (pronounced 'varvaros') ; people couldn't understand what others were saying, and every word sounded like 'βαρ βαρ' (pronc: 'var var'), thus βάρβαρος.</p></li>
<li><p>George Martin was inspired for his novels by the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_the_Roses"" rel=""nofollow"">War of the Roses</a> as well as by the Hundred Years' War, the Crusades and the Albigensian Crusade. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire#Writing_process"" rel=""nofollow"">""Interview: George Martin"".</a> Deep Magic 41: 19–21. 2005.)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I don't know anything about the 4th point you mention</p>

<p>So, my conclusion would be that <strong>no, A song of ice and fire has not been inspired by the Chinese History</strong>. Most of Martin's influences are from European history, but I don't believe that that restricted him not to influence from other histories around the globe. So far though, that's all we have been told.</p>

"66029","What is the meaning of ""The seed is strong""?","<p>In ASOIAF, Jon Arryn repeated several times while dying, &quot;The seed is strong&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Eddard</strong>: &quot;Was there nothing else? No final word?</p>
<p><strong>Pycelle</strong>: &quot;When I saw that all hope had fled, I gave the Hand milk of the poppy [...] He whispered something to the king and his lady wife, a blessing for his son. <em>The seed is strong,</em> he said. At the end the speech was too slurred to comprehend. Death did not come until the next morning, but Lord Jon was at peace after that. He never spoke again.&quot;</p>
<p><sub><em>A Game of Thrones</em>, Eddard V</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But so far (I have read all the books), it doesn't seem to me that he was talking about sickly Robert. <strong>But who else? What is the evidence that he was/wasn't talking about his son?</strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","66035","<p>The clear implication made in the books is that when Jon Arryn, Hand of the King, said &quot;The seed is strong&quot; he was referring to the indications - based on documented bloodlines and inherited genetic characteristics - that Robert Baratheon did not father Joffrey, Tommen, or Myrcella on Cersei Lannister.</p>
<p>(Of course, in Westeros, no one would think of them as &quot;genetic characteristics&quot;.  But the inherited traits which we know to be genetics have long been recognized as having a bloodline relationship - more so, frankly, in systems where nobility intermarries and documents their births and marriages better than is the average.  And seed is slang for sperm, which leads to births, or so I'm led to believe...)</p>
<p>As for <strong>evidence</strong>:</p>
<p>Lysa Arryn remembering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jon knew.  <em>The seed is strong</em>, he told me.  His last words.  He kept saying Robert's name, and he grabbed my arm so hard he left marks.  <em>Tell them, the seed is strong</em></p>
<p><sub><em>A Game of Thrones</em>, Catelyn VI</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She goes on to interpret it as &quot;[Jon's] seed.  He wanted everyone to know what a good strong boy my baby was going to be.&quot;  But she's an idiot (that's clearly established in the books).  Robert is the name of both her son and the King.  He was trying to get a message out, she was hearing what she wanted to.</p>
<p>Ned confronted Cersei when he figured it out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;All three are Jaime's,&quot; he said.  It was not a question.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank the gods.&quot;</p>
<p><em>The seed is strong</em>, Jon Arryn had cried on his deathbed, and
so it was.  All those bastards, all with hair as black as night.
Grand Maester Malleon recorded the last mating between stag and lion,
some ninety years ago,... Their only issue, an unnamed boy described
in Malleon's tome as a <em>large and lusty lad boar with a full head of
black hair.</em> ... No matter how far back Ned searched in the brittle
yellowed pages, always he found the gold yielding before the coal.</p>

<p>Since we know that</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>Jon Snow is now the son of Rhaegar (HBO final episode), </p>
</blockquote>

<p>won't he get the push to be the new King with Daenerys as his queen? Wouldn't that solve all the lineage issues, claims to the throne, and unify everything? </p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><adaptation-comparison>","139471","<p>The books and the show have diverged pretty far, especially when it comes to Aegon Targaryen, and will likely never match up.</p>

<p>As far as we know, Aegon Targaryen is <em>not</em> alive in the show -- we've seen no hint that he is hiding anywhere, and Varys has always openly supported Daenerys . This is most obvious in the last few episodes of Season 6. The entire plot thread where Tyrion meets Aegon was skipped completely, and Dany, not Aegon, is about to make landfall on Westeros with an army.</p>

<p>In the books, on the other hand, Aegon Targaryen is still alive, and he has a <em>more</em> legitimate claim to the throne. He's also already in Westeros, and the people in King's Landing (well, Kevan at least) are aware of him and suspect he might be telling the truth. </p>

<p>There's no way that Aegon and Jon can be the ""same"" character, for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the books, Jon Snow is almost exactly the same person as on the show. It's fully expected that his parents will be revealed to be Rhaegar and Lyanna Stark. In the books, Aegon is the son of Rhaegar and Elia Martell, a true born son that has since gone into hiding. Both are alive at the same time.</li>
<li>In the show, Jon Snow has not been given <em>any</em> of Aegon's character or plot development. Aegon was thought killed, secretly hidden, and grew up in Essos fully knowing who he was. Jon's story in the books is basically the same as his story in the show.</li>
<li>In the books, Varys has been secretly supporting Aegon since his birth, and done everything he can to get Aegon back on the throne. In the show, all of that plot development was given to <em>Dany</em>, not Jon.</li>
<li>As far as the lineage issue goes: Jon Snow is a bastard; he has no claim to the Iron Throne regardless of which family sits on it, unless the <em>existing</em> King legitimizes him. His claim to the Throne of the North was given to him not because he inherited it, but because the Lords of the North merely declared him King by fiat. That's not going to give him a claim to the Seven Kingdoms in any case.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's no indication that the books are going to ""sync up"" to the show in this regard. It would be near impossible to take the story arc that Aegon has been following and somehow ""merge"" it with Jon's at this point. Most likely, the show is simply going to ignore everything about the Aegon plot and go their own way. (It's also possibly -- indeed, in this series, likely -- that Aegon just outright dies and the whole problem goes away. We'll find out eventually.)</p>

"139483","Why are Stannis and Renly never referred to as ""Prince""?","<p>It seems that almost any direct male relation to a King will be given the honor of being called Prince. </p>

<p>Easy examples, Joffrey and Tommen are the sons of King Robert</p>

<p>Harder example, Bran and Rickon are the brothers of the ""King"" in the North.</p>

<p>Holdover example, Doran is ruler of Dorne and were allowed to maintain the Prince titles after they were not conquered by the dragons. We also see again that a brother, Oberyn, is given the title as well. </p>

<p>The same is true for females (for once!). Myrcella is called a Princess as she is the daughter of King Robert. Shireen like wise is called as her father is claiming to be king.</p>

<p>So we can confirm that <em>brothers</em> of a King will be called ""Prince"". However, we never see Stannis and Renly given this title (before the death of Robert). </p>

<p>Is there any reasoning for this? Did their positions as Lords of Dragonstone and Storms End and as members of the Small Council somehow ""out rank"" their status as princes? </p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><names>","139488","<p>For Bran and Rickon, it's worth noting that both are Robb's heirs. Renly and Stannis are not. It may simply  be the case that they were once called princes, but became ""Lords"" when Robert had children. </p>

<p>In Stannis' case, it may also be to avoid the awkwardness in calling him ""the Prince of Dragonstone,"" a title that historically implied that he would be the heir. Likewise, in Renly's case his primary duty was as Lord Paramount of the Stormlands. Both are also on the Small Council, whose members are called ""lord.""</p>

<p>Which brings me to an important point: more so than the Targaryens princes ever were, Stannis and Renly are lords in their own right rather than just a part of the royal family. Under the Targaryens, principality over Dragonstone and Summerhall was never seen as lordships. They were properties belonging to the crown that were traditionally granted as a seat for royal Targs and could be given and retracted at the crown's whim.</p>

<p>But Robert didn't give Renly and Stannis principality over Dragonstone and the Stormlands, he gave it to them as <em>lordships</em>. Renly's sons would inherit Storm's End after him, Stannis's sons would inherit Dragonstone, etc. each creating cadet branches of the main family. To hammer in this distinction, I wouldn't be surprised if it were the Baratheon bros themselves who insisted on going by Lord.</p>

"66178","How did Eddard Know the True Parentage of Joffrey, Tommen and Myrcella?","<p>I get that the dark-haired seed is strong and we can infer that the three Baratheon-Lannister children are not Robert's. But how did Eddard correctly guess that the real father was Jaime, and not some other random guy that Cersei was with?</p>

<p>Bran could have been pushed out of the window with that knowledge also. Isn't it also possible that the golden-haired seed is stronger in comparison to another gene, due to which the children were blond?</p>

<p>Finally, the Queen's brother is the last person anyone would expect her to have an affair with. So what did I miss that points the finger at Jaime Lannister?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","66180","<p>After the assassination attempt, it seemed obvious that Bran was pushed because he knew/saw something that he shouldn't have. Once it was clear that Cersei was cheating on Robert and bearing another man's children, it'd be a pretty good guess that Bran caught them in the act.</p>

<p>So from there, Eddard would only need to consider every member of King Robert's retinue who visited Winterfell. All of the adult noble men left Winterfell with the king and Eddard to go hunting during the hours that Bran was pushed... except for Jaime, who stayed behind to protect the queen. Jaime, who had previously shown himself capable of dishonorable violence. Jaime, his sister's stalwart defender. Jaime, who would have been in close proximity with the queen during the time of all three conceptions.</p>

<p>Couple that with how overwhelmingly all three Baratheon children had the Lannister look, and I don't think it's that hard of a conclusion to draw.</p>

<p>Also keep in mind, Eddard summons Cersei to the garden because he has discovered ""the truth that Jon Arryn died for."" Cersei is the one who starts talking about how Jaime would have killed Robert if he knew he hit her. It's <em>that</em> comment that leads Eddard to say, ""Your brother... or your lover?"" So it may be that Eddard summoned Cersei knowing that the kids weren't Robert's, but only suspecting that Jaime was the father. Cersei assumed Eddard knew everything, and basically telegraphed that they were lovers.</p>

<p>Do we know preceisely how Jon Arryn found out about ""the strong seed"" in Robert's family? </p>

<p>I am wondering if he actually investigated and learned or whether Littlefinger simply told him. Basically I am looking for evidence for a shortcut to tie everything bad that happend to Littlefinger without any complex theories.</p>

<p>Hasn't anybody ever cared why and how Jon started his investigations? 
It is intuitive that Stannis would look for something like this to claim the throne is, but why Jon Arryn? Why would he look to act against the marriage of King Baratheon whom he helped to win the Iron Throne alongside the Lannisters?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","139748","<h1>Books' Perspective</h1>
<h3>Who was responsible for commencement Jon Arryn's investigation?</h3>
<p>It was Lord Stannis who suspected something wrong in physical features of his nephews and niece first and brought his suspicions to Jon Arryn, which lead to their investigation about parentage of the three princelings.</p>
<p>As Stannis explained to Catelyn in <em>A Clash of Kings</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Lord Stannis,&quot; she asked, &quot;if you knew the queen to be guilty of such
monstrous crimes, why did you keep silent? &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I did not keep silent,&quot; Stannis declared. &quot;<strong>I brought my suspicions to</strong>
<strong>Jon Arryn</strong>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he explains why he came to Jon Arryn with his suspicions rather than Robert himself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Rather than your own brother?”<br><br>
“My brother’s regard for me was never more than dutiful,” said
Stannis. “From me, such accusations would have seemed peevish and
selfserving, a means of placing myself first in the line of
succession. <strong>I believed Robert would be more disposed to listen if
the charges came from Lord Arryn</strong>, whom he loved.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jon Arryn had no idea or suspicions prior to Lord Stannis coming to him with his suspicion. Or at least, nothing suggests that he in fact had any suspicions before Stannis approached him.</p>
<h3>The investigation</h3>
<p>Jon Arryn and Stannis Baratheon worked closely to investigate the apparent lack of Baratheon features in Cersei's children. And at first Jon began by obtaining <em>the Lineage of Great Houses</em> from Grand Maester and observing animal breeding to understand how genetic traits were passed from parents to off-spring.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Carrots and apples,&quot; Ned repeated. It sounded as if this boy would be even less use than the others. And he was the last of the four Littlefinger had turned up. Jory had spoken to each of them in turn. Ser Hugh had been brusque and uninformative, and arrogant as only a new-made knight can be. If the Hand wished to talk to him, he should be pleased to receive him, but he would not be questioned by a mere captain of guards … even if said captain was ten years older and a hundred times the swordsman. The serving girl had at least been pleasant. She said <strong>Lord Jon had been reading more than was good for him</strong>, that he was troubled and melancholy over his young son's frailty, and gruff with his lady wife. The potboy, now cordwainer, had never exchanged so much as a word with Lord Jon, but he was full of oddments of kitchen gossip: the lord had been quarreling with the king, the lord only picked at his food, the lord was sending his boy to be fostered on Dragonstone, <strong>the lord had taken a great interest in the breeding of hunting hounds</strong>, the <strong>lord had visited a master armorer to commission a new suit of plate, wrought all in pale silver with a blue jasper falcon and a mother-of-pearl moon on the breast. The king's own brother had gone with him to help choose the design, the potboy said. No, not Lord Renly, the other one, Lord Stannis.</strong><br><sub>A Game of Thrones - Eddard VI</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evidently whatever they found during their reading and observations was suspicious enough so they started seeking out natural born Children of Robert Baratheon. The information however didn't mean much for Eddard since he didn't understand much of it particularly the visit to Tobho Mott to see Gendry on pretext of commissioning a new armour.</p>
<p>From <em>A Game of Thrones</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The lad swears Lord Jon was as strong as a man half his age. Often
went riding with Lord Stannis, he says.”</p>
<p><strong>Stannis again, Ned thought</strong>. He found that curious. <strong>Jon Arryn and he had been cordial, but never friendly</strong>. And while Robert had been
riding north to Winterfell, Stannis had removed himself to
Dragonstone, the Targaryen island fastness he had conquered in his
brother’s name. He had given no word as to when he might return.
“Where did they go on these rides?” Ned asked.</p>
<p><strong>“The boy says that they visited a brothel.”</strong></p>
<p>“A brothel?” Ned said. “The Lord of the Eyrie and Hand of the King
visited a brothel with Stannis Baratheon?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They had gone to that brothel to see Barra, Robert's daughter. Despite the mother having light colored hair, the daughter had inherited Baratheon black locks which confirmed some of their suspicions.</p>
<p>Then Ned went to the armourer Jon Arryn and Stannis Baratheon went to together.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ned smiled. “Did you make a falcon helm for Lord Arryn?”</p>
<p>Tobho Mott paused a long moment and set aside his wine. “<strong>The Hand
did call upon me, with Lord Stannis, the king’s brother</strong>. I regret to
say, they did not honor me with their patronage.”</p>
<p>Ned looked at the man evenly, saying nothing, waiting. He had found
over the years that silence sometimes yielded more than questions. And
so it was this time.</p>
<p>“<strong>They asked to see the boy</strong>,” the armorer said, “so I took them
back to the forge.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There they found out Gendry, whose mother was a blonde yet the boy had Baratheon Black hair and blue eyes. This further cemented their suspicions.</p>
<p>Not to mention, Stannis knew that Robert's bastard Edric Storm who was sired on Delena Florent also had black hair and blue eyes. He sent the child to Storm's End after the birth. Jon Arryn plausibly knew<sup>1</sup> about the bastard daughter Robert had fathered when he was a ward of Lord Arryn at Eyrie. That Girl, Mya Stone also had black hair and blue eyes.</p>
<p>The final thing that confirmed their doubts was what they found out in a book about lineage of Great Houses which recorded marriages and births.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“One thing,” Ned told him. “<strong>I should be curious to examine the book
that you lent Jon</strong> the day before he fell ill.”</p>
<p>“I fear you would find it of little interest,” Pycelle said. “<strong>It was
a ponderous tome by Grand Maester Malleon on the lineages of the great
houses</strong>.”</p>
<p>“Still, I should like to see it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There, Lord Arryn found out that every time a Baratheon married a Lannister, Black hair genes won against Golden hair genes. This was the final proof they needed. As Eddard Stark later found out for himself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The seed is strong, Jon Arryn had cried on his deathbed, and so it
was. <strong>All those bastards, all with hair as black as night</strong>. Grand
Maester Malleon recorded the last mating between stag and lion, some
ninety years ago, when <strong>Tya Lannister wed Gowen Baratheon</strong>, third
son of the reigning lord. Their only issue, an unnamed boy described
in Malleon’s tome as a large and lusty lad <strong>born with a full head of
black hair</strong>, died in infancy.</p>
<p>Thirty years before that <strong>a male Lannister had taken a Baratheon
maid</strong> to wife. She had given him <strong>three daughters and a son, each
black- haired</strong>.</p>
<p>No matter how far back Ned searched in the brittle yellowed pages,
<strong>always he found the gold yielding before the coal</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Littlefinger's role</h3>
<p>In the same Book, Varys also said that Stannis had read the book and examined the physical features of Robert's bastards, although he mentions it in the wrong order as Stannis' own statements suggest that he was in fact the first person to suspect that, rather than the last.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;He accuses my brother and sister of incest. I wonder how he came by
that suspicion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Perhaps he read a book and looked at the color of a bastard's
hair</strong>, as Ned Stark did, and Jon Arryn before him. Or perhaps someone
whispered it in his ear.&quot; The eunuch's laugh was not his usual giggle,
but deeper and more throaty.</p>
<p>&quot;Someone like you, perchance?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Am I suspected? It was not me.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tyrion then asked Varys if it was not him, then who lead Stannis to his investigations and sowed the seeds of the suspicion. Varys subtly hinted that it may have been Littlefinger.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If you were not this whisperer, who was?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Some traitor, doubtless.&quot; Varys tightened the cinch.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Littlefinger?&quot;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&quot;I named no name.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice how Varys does not deny that it was Littlefinger but instead just insists that he named no one. Of course, <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/131317/54887"">Varys has his own motives</a> so everything he says can't be trusted.</p>
<p>So, it is possible that it was Littlefinger who made Lord Stannis suspicious about parentage of Cersei's children and therefore <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/139649/54887"">planned the war of the five Kings</a>.</p>
<h3>Will Stannis seek something to claim the throne for himself regardless?</h3>
<p>That would be against the very character of the man. He had no desire to claim the throne. But once he came to find out that he was actually the rightful heir, he was determined to win it because:</p>
<ol>
<li>He has an iron sense about laws. If something is his by law, he will never forfeit it. If something wasn't his by law, he would never claim it.</li>
<li>He had a duty to his daughter who was the rightful heir to the throne after him.</li>
<li>He believed he had to fight the war for survival of humanity even though he thought that this war will eventually kill him. But he was willing to pay that price for his people.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you see, the desire for the throne or greed rather, doesn't come into it.</p>
<p>To prove these points, see the following canon evidence.</p>
<p>Stannis said this to Davos in <em>A Storm of Swords</em>, when the latter asked him why did he want the throne:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>It is not a question of wanting</strong>. The throne is mine, as Robert's heir. <strong>That is law</strong>. After me, <strong>it must pass to my daughter</strong>,
unless Selyse should finally give me a son. I am king. <strong>Wants do not
enter into it. I have a duty to my daughter. To the realm</strong>. Even to
Robert. He loved me but little, I know, yet he was my brother. The
Lannister woman gave him horns and made a motley fool of him. She may
have murdered him as well, as she murdered Jon Arryn and Ned Stark.
For such crimes there must be justice. Starting with Cersei and her
abominations. But only starting. I mean to scour that court clean. As
Robert should have done after the Trident.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also explained that he was willing to pay the ultimate price as was his duty being King:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know the cost! Last night, gazing into that hearth, I saw things in
the flames as well. I saw a king, a crown of fire on his brows,
burning… burning, Davos. <strong>His own crown consumed his flesh &amp; turned
him into ash. Do you think I need Melisandre to tell me what that
means? Or you?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Cersei had given birth to even one Black-haired child<sup>2</sup>, Stannis probably would have never doubted anything. He was not looking for excuses to claim the throne.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>One thing is clear. It was Lord Stannis who started the investigations after taking Jon Arryn on board.</p>
<p>Another thing, which is unclear but is hinted, is that Littlefinger may have caused Lord Stannis to be suspicious in the first place.</p>
<hr />
<h1>Show's Perspective</h1>
<p>In the show, like many other key logical variables, this one is also missing.</p>
<p>It is implied that Stannis had no idea about the truth behind birth of Cersei's children and only learnt about it when Eddard Stark sent him a letter informing him about death of Robert and him being the heir.</p>
<p>From <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Stannis_Baratheon"" rel=""noreferrer"">Show Wiki</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stannis hosts a council and prepares a letter to be distributed
throughout the Seven Kingdoms. <strong>He has learned from Eddard Stark that
Joffrey Baratheon is a bastard</strong> born of incest between Cersei
Lannister and her brother Jaime rather than Robert Baratheon's true
heir.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Show does not give any hint that why did Jon Arryn begin his investigations except that he did and died as a consequence. There is no mention of liaison between Stannis and Jon Arryn in the show.</p>
<hr />
<p><sub><strong>1.</strong> Since whole Vale knew who Mya's father was, How could Lord of Vale not know that it was Robert, who was his own ward?</sub></p>
<p><sub><strong>2.</strong> In Books, Cersei never gave birth to any Black haired child or any child whose father may have been Robert. Show however, added a brief mention of a Child who died in infancy who may have been Robert's. Which begs the question that if that was the case, Why should have Jon Arryn suspected anything wrong at all? The suspicious thing was that none of the Princelings had Black hair. If there was one, it should have quelled the suspicions as suggested by Tyrion in the books.</sub></p>

<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/R%27hllor#Behind_the_Scenes"" rel=""noreferrer"">According to George R. R. Martin</a>, this religion's dualistic aspects of a good and an evil god are inspired by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism"" rel=""noreferrer"">Zoroastrianism,</a> along with the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharism"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cathars</a> of Medieval Europe.</p>
<p>In <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTTW8M_etko"" rel=""noreferrer"">this interview</a> (at about 47:00 GRRM) talks about his inspirations for religion in his works. I have taken the relevant parts and transcribed them below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Host]</strong> Okay, so this next question is, 'In your books there are several religious systems such as The Seven, The Drowned God, The Faceless Men, The Old Gods, etc. How do you come up with such a detailed yet entirely distinct doctrines? Are there any that aren't detailed in the books?</p>
<p><strong>[GRRM]</strong> Well, yes. To start with the last part first, yes. There are many religions that are not detailed. You can see some of them in Arya's Bravos chapters where she visits, passes through the Island of the Gods and I throw in references to 17 different obscure religions that I'm probably never going to reveal in much detail.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The major religions that actually play a significant role in the story are somewhat based on real religions, or real religious systems. Although,I don't believe in just doing a one to one transformation where I'm going to take like Islam and file off the serial numbers and call it Mislam or something and pretend it's the same. I take certain tenants of the religions, but I maybe take part of this and part of that and I meld them together and I think about it and I add a few imaginative elements.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>And then you have the Red God, The Lord of Light, from across the sea which has a certain Zoroastrianism elements to it with the fire worship and so forth and the duality. And also a lot from the Albigensian Crusade, the Cathars, who were exterminated by the Catholics and the Great Albigensian Crusade. But they had a fundamental belief, a dualist religion, that there were two gods, a good god and an evil god, and the world that we live in was created by the evil god...</p>

<p>In <em>The World of Ice and Fire</em>, it is mentioned that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Two estrangements are recorded</strong> but they did not last more than a year or two before the pair resumed their customary friendship. The
<strong>Second quarrel</strong> is of note, as it was due to Jaehaerys' decision of 92 A.C.  to pass over his granddaughter <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rhaenys_Targaryen_(daughter_of_Aemon)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Rhaenys</a> - the daughter of

<p>Alysanne saw no reason why a man should be preferred over a woman. And
if Jaehaerys thought women of less use, then he would have no need of
her.</p>

<p>The second quarrel continued for two years and was ended in 94 AC with intervention of their daughter Septa <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Maegelle_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Maegelle</a> (Formerly styled as Princess Maegelle Targaryen).</p>
<p>However, I could find no mention of the first quarrel.</p>
<h3>Question</h3>
<p>My Question(s) are:</p>
<ol>
<li>What was it about and how long did it last?</li>
<li>What made them reconcile after the first quarrel?</li>
</ol>
<h3>Possible leads</h3>
<p>The following may help you in finding the answer.</p>
<ol>
<li>It was before 92 AC (duh!).</li>
<li>It must have been mentioned somewhere in <em>The World of Ice and Fire</em> but apparently I can't find it. After searching a lot now, it appears that it may have never been mentioned (yet) but I am not sure.</li>
<li>The first quarrel must have spanned over a period of no more than two years<sup>1</sup></li>
<li>It may have been about the decision to give away Prince Vaegon to the citadel for training as a maester at a young age. This is my speculation.</li>
<li>It may have been about the decision to give away Princess Maegelle to the Faith. This is also my speculation.</li>
<li>It may have been about death of their daughter Princess Viserra in a drunken horse race. Again, my speculation.</li>
<li>It may have been about the decision to give Princess Saera to the faith against her will. The Princess escaped from Westeros and went to Essos, never to return. This is my speculation.</li>
<li>Also, As suggested by <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/32276/s-fruggiero"">S.Fruggiero</a>, It is also plausible that first quarrel may have erupted when Wildlings attacked the Wall. Jaehaerys flew to aid of Night's Watch on his dragon along with Alysanne where they defeated the wildling host. It is possible that Jaehaerys may have wanted Alysanne to stay behind in safety of Red Keep while the Queen wanted to take a part in defense of the realm.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Reasoning for speculations</h3>
<p><strong>You may ignore the following if you don't wish to consider the possible leads I provided.</strong></p>
<p>It is unclear how much role did Alysanne play in sending away her children to institutes like the Citadel or the Faith so it is plausible she may have resented such decisions, especially as they were made when the children were very young and in Saera's case, against her will.</p>
<p>Alysanne held great sway in court and often influenced decisions of the state but it is unclear if these decisions were made with her consent. Jaehaerys is known to be a wise King and he must have known what one of his descendants, King Daeron II said centuries later:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Too many dragons are just as dangerous as too few.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So for the good of the realm, Jaehaerys would be expected to dispatch his spare children (As line of succession was safe in lives of his eldest sons; Princes Aemon and Baelon) to orders like Citadel or the Faith, putting an end to their claims and minimizing the possibility of a war of succession. In such decisions, Jaehaerys did not even listen to Alysanne, such as his decision to passover their grand-daughter Rhaenys as he might have suspected that Westeros was not ready for a female monarch (Which proved to be true decades later when Dance of the Dragons started between two factions of House Targaryen).</p>
<p>So it is very much possible that Jaehaerys may have made those decisions unilaterally, without taking Alysanne on board, therefore causing the first Quarrel.</p>
<hr />
<p><sub>1. Alysanne and Jaehaerys are said to have married in 50 AC and they remained married for 46 years. Which makes one think that Alysanne died in 96 AC, ending their marriage. That is however incorrect as Alysanne died in either 100 AC or 99 AC as it is stated that Alysanne died within a year of suicide of Princess Gael, which happened in 99 AC. The 46-years marriage only stands true if we minus the years of their estrangement. As we know for sure, second quarrel last for two years, that brings us to 98 AC. If She died in 99 AC, the first quarrel must have lasted a year or less. Otherwise If She died in 100 AC, it must have lasted for two.

","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","198973","<h1>What was it about?</h1>
<p>After the death of Princess Viserra (and Daella and Alyssa a few years before) Alysanne decided to approach Jaehaerys about Saera asking him to let her come home. The kings words to her were so harsh they fell out and so the king went off on business to the westerlands and the queen went to Dragonstone to mourn for her daughters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was the hour of the wolf, the darkest time of the night, when it fell to Ser Ryam Redwyne of the Kingsguard to rouse the king and queen from their sleep to tell them that their daughter had been found dead in an alley at the foot of Aegon’s High Hill.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Though Jaehaerys had forbidden it, Alysanne had defied his edict and secretly engaged agents to keep watch over her wayward child across the narrow sea. Saera was still in Lys, she knew from their reports, still at the pleasure garden. Now twenty years of age, she oft entertained her admirers still garbed as a novice of the Faith; there were evidently a good many Lyseni who took pleasure in ravishing innocent young women who had taken vows of chastity, even when the innocence was feigned.</p>
<p>It was her grief over the loss of Princess Viserra that finally drove the queen to approach Jaehaerys about Saera once again. She brought Septon Barth along with her, to speak on the virtues of forgiveness and the healing properties of time. Only when Barth had finished did Her Grace mention Saera’s name. “Please,” she begged the king, “it is time to bring her home. She has been punished enough, surely. She is our daughter.”</p>
<p>Jaehaerys would not be moved. “She is a Lyseni whore,” His Grace replied. “She opened her legs for half my court, threw anold woman down the steps, and tried to steal a dragon. What more do you require? Have you given any thought as to how she got to Lys? She had no coin. How do think she paid for her passage?”</p>
<p>The queen cringed at the harshness of his words, but still she would not yield. “If you will not bring Saera home for love of her, bring her home for love of me. I need her.”</p>
<p>“You need her as a Dornishman needs a pit viper,” Jaehaerys said. “I am sorry. King’s Landing has sufficient whores. I do not wish to hear her name again.” With those words, he rose to leave, but at the door he halted and turned back. “We have been together since we were children. I know you as well as you know me. Right now you are thinking that you do not need my leave to bring her home, that you can take Silverwing and fly to Lys yourself. What would you do then, visit her in her pleasure garden? Do you imagine she will fly into your arms and beg forgiveness? She is more like to slap your face. And what will the Lyseni do, if you try and make off with one of their whores? She has value to them. How much do you think it costs to lay with a Targaryen princess? At best they will demand a ransom for her. At worst they may decide to keep you too. What will you do then, shout for Silverwing to burn their city down? Would you have me send Aemon and Baelon with an army, to see if they can prise her free? You want her, yes, I hear you, you need her…but she does not need you, or me, or Westeros. She is dead. Bury her.”</p>
<p>Queen Alysanne did not fly to Lys, but neither did she ever quite forgive the king for the words he spoke that day. Plans had been under way for some time for the two of them to make another progress the following year, returning to the westerlands for the first time in twenty years. Shortly after their falling out, the queen informed Jaehaerys that he should go alone. She was going back to Dragonstone, alone, to grieve for their dead daughters.</p>

<h1>What made them reconcile after the first quarrel?</h1>
<p>Jaehaerys finally ended up in Oldtown after travelling around for a long while. There he visited his daughter Septa Maegelle who persuaded him to make up with the queen because of Rhaenys marriage the following year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His journeys finally ended in Oldtown, where he visited with his daughter Septa Maegelle, was blessed by the High Septon and feasted by the Conclave, and enjoyed a tourney staged in his honor by Lord Hightower. Ser Ryam Redwyne again emerged as champion.</p>
<p>The maesters of that time referred to the estrangement betwixt the king and queen as the Great Rift. The passage of time, and a subsequent quarrel that was near as bitter, gave it a new name: the First Quarrel. That is how it is known to this day. We shall speak of the Second Quarrel in good time.</p>
<p>It was Septa Maegelle who bridged the Rift. “This is foolish, Father,” she said to him. “Rhaenys is to be married next year, and it should be a great occasion. She will want all of us there, including both you and Mother. The archmaesters call you the Conciliator, I have heard. It is time that you conciliated.”</p>
<p>The scolding had the desired effect. A fortnight later, King Jaehaerys returned at last to King’s Landing, and Queen Alysanne returned from her own self-imposed exile on Dragonstone. What words passed between them we can never know, but for a good while afterward they were once again as close as they had been before.</p>

</blockquote>
<h1>How long did it last?</h1>
<p>It appears to have lasted for 2 years maximum, from sometime early on in 88 AC to sometime 89 AC.</p>
<p>Viserra died in 87 AC and the queen mourned with Maegelle for the rest of the year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite their differences, the loss of Princess Viserra was devastating to the queen. In the space of five years, the gods had taken three of her daughters: Daella in 82 AC, Alyssa in 84 AC, Viserra in 87 AC. Prince Baelon was greatly distraught as well, wondering if he should have spoken to his sister less brusquely the night he found her naked in his bed. Though he and Aemon were a comfort to the king and queen in their time of grief, along with Aemon’s wife, the Lady Jocelyn, and their daughter, Rhaenys, it was to her own remaining daughters that Alysanne turned for solace.</p>
<p>Maegelle, twenty-five years of age and a septa, took leave from her sept to stay with her mother for the rest of that year, and Princess Gael, a sweet, shy child of seven, became the queen’s constant shadow and support, even sharing her bed at night. The queen took strength from their presence…but even so, more and more she found her thoughts turning to the daughter who was not with her.</p>
<p><sub><em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, &quot;The Long Reign, Jaehaerys and Alysanne - Policy, Progeny, and Pain&quot;</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The argument then happens in 88 AC just before Jaehaerys sets off for Casterly Rock.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And so it was that Jaehaerys Targaryen flew to Casterly Rock and the other great seats of the west alone in 88 AC.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>We know that Rhaenys was married in 90 AC and so the king and queen must have made up in 89 AC as they made up when she was to be married the following year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was Septa Maegelle who bridged the Rift. “This is foolish, Father,” she said to him. “Rhaenys is to be married next year, and it should be a great occasion. She will want all of us there, including both you and Mother. The archmaesters call you the Conciliator, I have heard. It is time that you conciliated.”</p>

<p>In the 90th year after Aegon’s Conquest, the king and queen shared one of their last good times together, as they celebrated the wedding of their eldest grandchild, Princess Rhaenys, to Corlys Velaryon of Driftmark, Lord of the Tides.</p>

<p>My question is: why wouldn't Cersei and Jaime try to kill Bran after realizing that he'd awaken after the fall? Weren't they afraid that he'd remember what happen and expose them?</p>

At that point Bran was being watched 24/7 by his mother, and both Jaime and Cersei are prominent royal guests. It may not have been possible for them to make suitable plans without exposing themselves. At that point the safer play may have been to just hit the road for King's Landing as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Also, by that point the Starks were suspicious about what happened since Bran had never fallen before, and Catelyn received a letter from Lysa blaming the Lannisters for Jon Arryn's death.

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Cersei takes advantage of Taena Merryweather's supposed infatuation with her and engages in infamously unromantic lesbian sex with her.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do we know of an out of universe reason for this scene? What does the Taena arc add to Cersei or the story? I can't see any reason outside of titillating readers.</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","66640","<p>I think one reason for the scene might be to strength the parallels with Dany in <em>A Dance With Dragons</em>. Both Dany and Cersei are two women who have fought difficult battles to place themselves in power in a man's world... only to utterly suck at actually ruling. Dany ALSO has a close intimate experience with her female bedwarmer. The difference is that while Cersei forces herself on Taena, it's Dany who is pressed upon by her handmaiden. In a way it parallels their deficiences: Dany is innocent and naive about the necessities of ruling, while Cersei is an overreaching brute.</p>

<p>But I think the major reason is simply to highlight certain aspects of her character.</p>

<ul>
<li>Cersei is greedy and controlling. When she wants something, she simply reaches out and grabs it.</li>
<li>Cersei is, for the lack of a better word, deviant. She manages to break pretty much every rule in the Faith about sex, which inevitably is the cause of her downfall.</li>
<li>Cersei is rash and foolish. Remember that the Merryweathers are bannermen to the Tyrells, Cersei's sworn enemy. Indeed, a <a href=""http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/8204-grand-tyrell-conspiracy-theory/"">common fan theory</a> is that Taena is a Tyrell spy, who basically tricked Cersei into moving against Margaery. Only hours earlier while in bed, Cersei even <em>considers the fact that Taena could be informing on her</em>, but initiates sex anyways.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, if you buy into ""Taena is a spy"" theory, it isn't that unlikely that their little tryst could serve a narrative purpose in the latter books. Cersei's storyline is far from over.</p>

<p>I expect the only way to get a 100% canon out-of-universe explanation would be to ask GRRM himself why he included the scene. And frankly, it's not all that pivotal a scene to warrant an explicit explanation on his part.</p>

<p>My question is, <strong>Why did he keep ""Rivers"" as his last name and not change it to ""Targaryen""?</strong> or at least ""Blackwood""?</p>

<p>Consider this line from <em>A Storm of Swords</em>:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> All he had to do was say the word, and he would be Jon Stark, and nevermore a Snow.<br /><sup><em>-A Song of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Chapter Seventy-Six (Jon).</em></sup></p>
</blockquote>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","66981","<p>As others have pointed out, the only examples from A Song of Ice and Fire of legitimized names are (hypothetically) Jon Snow becoming Jon Stark and Ramsay Snow becoming Ramsay Bolton. The Princess and the Queen adds another example: Addam and Alyn Velaryon, the bastards sons of Lord Corlys Velaryon.</p>

<p>Since none of the Great Bastards went by Targeryen, it clearly isn't a concrete rule. So the only real question is what determines the name change. I have a few theories:</p>

<p><strong><em>Only bastards legitimized for the express purpose of inheritance gain the last name</em></strong>.
Jon, Ramsay, and Addam and Alyn were all being legitimized because their fathers lacked a male heir. It would be curious then that both the Velayron bastards were legitimized, but I imagine that could be explained by the fact that there was a war on, and Addam's survival wasn't a given by any means.</p>

<p>The Great Bastards were legitimized, but with the understanding that Aegon the Unworthy's firstborn Dareon would be placed on the throne. Given that Dareon had four sons, the chances of any of his half-brothers taking the throne through the line of succession would be remote.</p>

<p>This is my preferred theory, especially since Petyr Baelish strongly implies that even the legitimate Harry Hardyng would become an Arryn if he inherited the Eyrie:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When Robert dies, Harry the Heir becomes Lord Harrold, Defender of the Vale and Lord of the Eyrie. Jon Arryn’s bannermen will never love me, nor our silly, shaking Robert, but they will love their <strong>Young Falcon...</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>Personal preference</em></strong>- Jon Snow always dreamed of becoming a Stark, and Ramsay hated that he was a bastard. It may be that one gets to choose whether or not to take their father's name. The Great Bastards had a pretty awful man for a father, and Brynden in particular seemed to embrace the disdain and fear others had for him. Meanwhile, the other Great Bastards went by names like Blackfyre and Seastar that reflected their backgrounds or personalities.</p>

<p><strong><em>It may have to do with the mother</em></strong>- All the known Great Bastards were the children of noblewomen. By contrast, Jon (allegedly), Ramsay, and the Velayron boys were the sons of commoners. It might be that when the children of two nobles are legitimized, they don't get a surname or some reason, perhaps to avoid disputes with the noblewoman's husband and children.</p>

"140922","How does a raven get intercepted?","<p>In  “A Song of Ice and Fire”, there are many instances when some nobility sends a knight to deliver a sensitive message rather than send a raven, because a raven can get intercepted.  I have no problem believing that it is <em>possible</em> to intercept a raven, but I imagine that this must a rather rare event - how is it that raven interception is such a real threat?</p>

<p>Based on the explanation given <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/36871/how-does-raven-post-work"">here</a>, the majority of ravens are trained to return to a specific castle. If we assume that a raven would travel “as the crow flies” (i.e. in roughly a straight line), it is not clear to me how a raven would get close enough to another castle to be intercepted unless it deviates from its straight path. So I find it unlikely that they could be intercepted by flying to (or near) an incorrect castle. </p>

<p>Another possibility is that the “common folk” would shoot down a raven and bring the message to their lord for favor. For this to work, I imagine that either a message is large enough to be visible on a flying raven or that people try to shoot every raven they see in the hope of getting a messenger raven. I find the former unlikely due to weight ratios (they’re not swallows, after all), and if the latter were true I imagine that ravens would be rather rare due to overhunting, but I do not recall any mention of this.</p>

<p>Is there an in-universe explanation as to how raven post interception is likely enough to occur as to warrant sending knights instead?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","140928","<h1>By accident (usually)</h1>
<h2>People do sometimes prefer knights to ravens</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“The first time I saw Riverrun, I was a squire green as summer grass,”
Jaime told his cousin. “Old Sumner Crakehall sent me to deliver a
message, one he swore could not be entrusted to a raven. Lord Hoster
kept me for a fortnight whilst mulling his reply, and sat me beside
his daughter Lysa at every meal.”</p>
<p><sub>—<em>A Feast for Crows</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>However, they seem more worried about mishap than malice</h2>
<p>It certainly seems possible to shoot down ravens:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Unless Lord Frey tells him,” Catelyn said sharply. “Theon, when you
return to my uncle, tell him he is to place his best bowmen around the
Twins, day and night, with orders to bring down any raven they see
leaving the battlements. I want no birds bringing word of my son’s
movements to Lord Tywin.”</p>
<p><sub>—<em>A Game of Thrones</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And indeed, other people consider this a risk:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Catelyn knelt and took her father’s hand in hers. It was a big hand,
but fleshless now, the bones moving loosely under the skin, all the
strength gone from it. “You should have told me,” she said. “A rider,
a raven…”</p>
<p>“Riders are taken, questioned,” he answered. “Ravens are brought
down…”</p>
<p><sub>—<em>A Game of Thrones</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As to <em>when</em> someone would shoot down a raven in the hopes of getting a message, the answer is presumably if they are suspicious. If a raven flies over a battlefield, it might be shot down on suspicion of coming from the enemy. If a raven leaves a castle and there are spies  in a nearby village, it might be shot down. If someone sees a raven flying during an hour when they are not usually active, that could also be cause for suspicion.  The raven population will not be depleted, because only during certain times and places will it be worth the trouble to target any ravens one sees.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that <strong>this is not always (or perhaps usually) intentional</strong>, though. It seems likely more people shoot down ravens for food than for information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ravens did not always win through. Some bowman could have brought the
bird down and roasted him for supper. The letter that would have set
her heart at ease might even now be lying by the ashes of some
campfire beside a pile of raven bones.</p>
<p><sub>—<em>A Storm of Swords</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Stannis spoke of the risks to his ravens, he counted storms and hawks among the dangers his ravens would face.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stannis turned to Davos. “The maester tells me that we have one
hundred seventeen ravens on hand. I mean to use them all. One hundred
seventeen ravens will carry one hundred seventeen copies of my letter
to every corner of the realm, from the Arbor to the Wall. Perhaps a
hundred will win through against storm and hawk and arrow.</p>
<p><sub>—<em>A Clash of Kings</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, as we see from the previous passage, ravens are frequently brought down merely out of hunger.</p>
<p>It seems there are two reasons not to entrust a sensitive message to a raven:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sensitive messages are usually important.</strong> If 14% of ravens fall victim to misadventure, then the message is lost quite frequently. A knight may be killed, but perhaps not nearly so often.</li>
<li><strong>Accidental interception would be the main worry.</strong> If some hunter shoots down a raven for a meal, they are bound to notice the message. And if they can read (or know someone who can) and have loose lips, the message could travel to the ears of those who could use it for harm.</li>

In theory the law and bloodlines are on his side and he is the rightful King of the Seven Kingdoms; but he has no followers other than his sister and Jorah, because he is unable to inspire belief.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He knew he ought to hide the rat, but he was so hungry. It had been two days since he had eaten, or maybe three. Down here in the dark it was hard to tell. Though his arms and legs were thin as reeds, his belly was swollen and hollow, and ached so much that he found he could not sleep. (DwD, Reek 1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Knocking his teeth out</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“He smiles less often now,” Lord Ramsay confessed. “I may have broken some of his pretty white teeth.” (DwD, Reek 1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Slicing off fingers and toes</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus far he had lost two fingers off his left hand and the pinky off his right, but only the little toe off his right foot against three from his left. (DwD, Reek 1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But its how he cuts them off that's the kicker.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Ramsay would never simply cut off a man’s finger. He preferred to flay it and let the exposed flesh dry and crack and fester. Reek had been whipped and racked and cut, but there was no pain half so excruciating as the pain that followed flaying. It was the sort of pain that drove men mad, and it could not be endured for long. Soon or late the victim would scream, “Please, no more, no more, stop it hurting, cut it off,” and Lord Ramsay would oblige. (DwD, Reek 1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Assorted whipping and flaying</strong></p>
<p>See the second quote above.</p>
<p><strong>Castration</strong></p>
<p>It's implied fairly strongly in the books that Ramsay has cut off Theon's, uh, Little Ironborn. In the show, they make it explicit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ramsay rose, the firelight shining on his face. “Reek, get over here. Get her ready for me.”</p>
<p>For a moment he did not understand. “I ... do you mean ... m’lord, I have no ... I ...”</p>
<p>“With your mouth,” Lord Ramsay said. (DwD, The Prince in Winterfell)</p>

<p><strong>Psychological torture</strong></p>
<p>Most notably, Ramsay intentionally allowed Theon and a woman named Kyra to escape, only so he could hunt them down and drag them back to the castle. But obviously, the nonstop torture didn't help. By the end, he makes Theon forget his own name, crafts an entirely new identity, and breaks the smiling prince into a writhing creature terrified of Ramsay. There are literally too many instances of this psychological torture to quote.</p>

<p>In fact, I think there was never a time when all five Kings we're concurrently crowned. </p>

<p>So when Davos reads Aemon's letter in A Storm of Swords, why is it addressed to ""The Five Kings""?</p>

<p>I know timelines are fuzzy and the Night's Watch doesn't always get the latest news, but it seems odd they would have heard of the crowning of Robb and Balon without having heard of Renly's situation. </p>

<p>Even if we agree with Skoobas argument in the linked post that Dany was one of the five, Aemon might not have seen it that way (note his inner monologue in ADWD re: genders and the Prince Who Was Promised) and likewise had no reason to believe she would be able to bring a force from Essos nor would he likely have the ability to get a letter to her with anything like the semi-reliability of Raven Post. </p>

<p>&quot;<strong>No doubt they will be glad to learn it. The Wall is a world apart,

down. &quot;What shall I tell Marsh concerning the men he begs for? Shall

<p>And also:</p>

<p>Secondly, GRRM deliberately tries to avoid providing a time frame when writing.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>So we can't really make any assumptions about the timeline and infer from it the date when Aemon dispatched his birds and when were they received by their intended recipients.</p>
<p>Now thirdly, Davos did not read the letter right away. It was received by Lord Alester Florent when he was the Hand of the King and he told the Maester that the King won't want to see it. After Lord Alester's downfall and his appointment as the new Hand to replace Florent, Davos Seaworth chanced upon the letter while learning how to read and immediately realised the gravity of the words.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His first duty was to help his king rule, and for that he must needs
understand the words the ravens brought. The best way to learn a thing
was to do it, he had found; sails or scrolls, it made no matter.</p>
<p>“This might serve our purpose.” Pylos passed him a letter.</p>
<p>Davos flattened down the little square of crinkled parchment and
squinted at the tiny crabbed letters.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Davos suddenly realized just what he was reading. He turned the letter
over, and saw that the wax that had sealed it had been black. “<strong>This
is from the Night’s Watch. Maester, has King Stannis seen this
letter</strong>?”</p>
<p>“<strong>I brought it to Lord Alester when it first arrived</strong>. He was the
Hand then. I believed he discussed it with the queen. When I asked him
if he wished to send a reply, he told me not to be a fool. ‘His Grace
lacks the men to fight his own battles, he has none to waste on
wildlings’ he said to me.<br><sub><em><strong>ASOS - Davos V</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that proves that the letter arrived right after the Battle of Blackwater Bay which happened a few weeks after Renly's demise. For all we know, it might be that Wall never learnt about Renly's death at that time. The fact that they knew of Robb's and Balon's coronation doesn't mean much. The Wall is in the North and anyone might have had sent the word forward that the North has a King again. Robb himself may have sent a raven forward to tell Jon. What we do know is that Lord Mormont knew about Robb's coronation and told Jon before they went on the Great Ranging. As for Balon's coronation, it was immediately followed by invasion of the North in the name of the Iron King of the Isles. Winterfell was sacked and burnt, and the Watch knew what happened down there in their neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Highgarden and Storm's End are however very far down in the South. News if any was sent their way, would have reached the Watch the last. Also note how long it took Davos to learn about Tywin's death, an equally important (If not more) event, he may not have learnt about it at all had he stayed at the Eastwatch.  We know for certain that the Watch knew about Renly's coronation, but when did they learn about his death? We know they knew of it by the time they very electing Mormont's successor but when exactly? It is possible that Lord Tywin's reply may have informed them of that development (In which he subtly hinted that he favours Janos Slynt for new Lord Commander - That played a role in the elections) but explicitly? We do not know.</p>

"141227","Why did Davos help Stannis during Robert's Rebellion?","<p>In the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Davos_Seaworth#History"">ASOIAF wiki</a>, it states that ""<em>almost a year into the siege of Storm's End, Davos took it upon himself to run the Redwyne blockade to smuggle onions and other foodstuffs into the castle</em>"".</p>

<p>If he took it upon himself to do this, then clearly no one commissioned him to help the besieged castle. Stannis himself states that during the siege he was all but forgotten about by his brother Robert and the other rebels, so this at least seems to be true. If I remember correctly he also never mentions in any of his chapters that anyone had asked him to help Storm's End.</p>

<p>But why would Davos risk death to help Stannis without any prior incentive?</p>

<p>The only thing that I can think of is gold, but Davos doesn't ever appear to be a particularly greedy man. He also seems to be constantly susprised by the fact that he was raised to knighthood, so again I find it hard to believe that he decided to take such a massive risk for that reason specifically. Every other Lord also appears to be surprised that Stannis decided to do this, so obviously it seems like a much greater reward than would have been expected.</p>

<p>In addition, if no one had asked Davos to smuggle food into the castle, how did he know they were in such a bad way as to require the food he brought? It was probably well known across the kingdom that Storm's End was under siege, but it could have been possible that they had food reserves to last longer than the year in which they held the castle. In which case, how would he even have been sure that he was going to get a reward at all for his actions?</p>

<p><strong>Is there any indication on what Davos' motivation for smuggling food into Storm's End was?</strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","141230","<p>""Taking it upon himself"" does not rule out money changing hands.</p>

<p>Davos is not interested in personal luxury, but he cares very much about providing for his family. At the time of Robert's Rebellion, Davos was a highly professional and successful smuggler, so he must have been used to making significant amounts of money.</p>

<p>We can assume Davos wanted Stannis to pay him for his help. The garrison was running out of food, but as Storm's End was the home of the Baratheon family, they would have had gold and jewels. It is plausible that Davos planned to enter Storm's End with his cargo of food; leave the way he came in, with a large sum of money; and never see Stannis again.</p>

<p>Davos may also have felt some pity for the garrison, or admiration for their courage. By themselves, these feelings might not have been sufficient for Davos to risk his life and those of his crew; but they might have helped motivate him to undertake such a risky job.</p>

<p>Finally, Stannis was known for his sense of honour. Davos must have hoped for a fair reward; but Stannis' idea of ""fair"" was almost certainly not what Davos expected. Stannis both rewarded Davos with much more than money (making him a knight, and one of his main advisors) and punished him (cutting off his finger joints).</p>

<p>To answer the second part of the question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If no one had asked Davos to smuggle food into the castle, how did he know they were in such a bad way as to require the food he brought?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the time of Davos' voyage, Storm's End had been under siege for almost a year. At the very least, they would have long since run out of <em>fresh</em> food. This would have made them prone to scurvy and similar illnesses, and made Davos' cargo very welcome.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Tyrion suggests that Aegon head to Westeros instead of going east to meet Daenerys.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why does Tyrion suggest this strategy?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","67809","<p><strong>Warning:</strong> This entire answer will contain spoilers from <em>A Dance With Dragons</em>.</p>

<p>There are several reasons why this would be a great move for Aegon. Tyrion has proven that he is a stout political strategist and would see these things.</p>

<p><strong>Independence</strong><br>
Tyrion sees that Aegon will need to show his strength and will to his subordinates in order to win supporters to his cause.<br>
Time and time again, supporters have left or been disillusioned of their leaders<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> due to spotting weakness.</p>

<p>Aegon will not have much support if the people of Westeros see him as a child whose lead by some old Griffon. He clearly needs to establish his dominance and prove his worthiness before people will flock to his cause.</p>

<p><strong>Foot-hold</strong><br>
Strategically, this is a good move, as the details of the plan are for Aegon to grab a castle or two before anyone notices, thereby giving him a strong foot-hold and a gateway into Westeros; it worked for <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org:8080/index.php/Aegon_I_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow"">Aegon the Conqueror</a>!</p>

<p><strong>Don't go to Dany, let her come to you</strong><br>
As mentioned in the same chapter you quoted:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tyrion is convinced that Daenerys will fly to Aegon's side and immediately love him, as he is the last of her line, <strong>and she is above all a ""rescuer""</strong>.<sup><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tyrion_VI_(A_Dance_with_Dragons)"" rel=""nofollow"">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And not only that, but why go to your Auntie asking for help, when you are the rightful King and need to show your strength and leadership by making your own path?</p>

<p><strong>Don't make the same mistakes</strong><br>
Daenerys is in a way trapped in Meereen. She is far, far away from Westeros and is surrounded by enemies - or at the very least, by strangers. It would not do for Aegon to be there; he will either:</p>

<ul>
<li>Help Dany win her fights, and then what?</li>
<li>Lose with Dany</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are not good options for Aegon, but rather distractions.</p>

<p><strong>Aegon</strong> is the prize and he is the one whom it's all about (at least Tyrion says so):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tyrion had no sooner exhaled than Young Griff grabbed hold of his arm. “What do you mean? I am <em>everything</em>? What did you mean by that? Why am I everything?” <br />“Why,” said Tyrion, “if the stone men had taken Yandry or Griff or our lovely Lemore, we would have grieved for them and gone on. Lose <em>you</em>, and this whole enterprise is undone, and all those years of feverish plotting by the cheesemonger and the eunuch will have been for naught … isn’t that so?”<br /><sup><em>-A Song of Ice and Fire: A Dance With Dragons, Part One - Dreams and Dust (Tyrion).</em></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What guarantee is there that she will help?</strong><br>
Tyrion is afraid that Dany won't accept Aegon. He comes out of nowhere and lays claims to all the things she has been promised, worked hard and sacrificed so much for<sup><strong>3</strong>

<p>I'm not too up on medieval history, but the idea of a roving knight doesn't crop up too much from what I remember - so I think it is something in-world. I certainly haven't seen Hedge Knight used outside of Martin's works.</p>

"2967","How did Gared (Night's Watch man) get back from behind The Wall?","<p>The surviving Black Brother, Gared, from the prologue of A Game of Thrones is apparently the deserter who is beheaded in the beginning of the book. </p>

<p>But how did he manage to get to Winterfell from the other side of The Wall? Or did the show throw me off track and in the book there weren't any survivors, so the deserter is someone else?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","2969","<h1>How did the deserter to get to Winterfell from the other side of The Wall?</h1>

<p>The Wall is there primarily to keep the wildlings from crossing in large numbers (in current times, at least).  It has never stopped individuals from crossing, if they know where to look.  </p>

<p>In the books, it is mentioned later on in the series that there are many fortifications along the Wall, but over time many of them have become disused and abandoned.  Coverage is not what it used to be.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that even the Direwolf made it from beyond the Wall, so climbing over the top is clearly not the only option.</p>

<p>In A Storm of Swords it is mentioned that there are four ways to get from one side of the Wall to the other (aside from being let through the gates by the Black Brothers):  you can climb it, attempt to cross the Bay of Seals by boat, descend into the ravines to the west of the Shadow Tower, or use the array of tunnels underneath (such as Gorne's Way).</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
<em>I just re-read the part where Bran, Hodor and the Reeds cross the Wall under the Nightfort.  There is a gate that is accessible to any sworn Brother, and it is certainly possible that the deserter somehow either knew of this, or found it.</em></p>

<h1>Who is the deserter?</h1>

<p>In the TV show, the younger ranger survives, but in the book <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Gared"">Gared</a> the older ranger survives. Since the execution scene is from Bran's perspective and Bran is less concerned with who the ranger is, we are not given his name but the descriptions match up enough to show that it is Gared.</p>

<p><strong>Prologue</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gared did not rise to the bait. He was an old man, past fifty, and he
  had seen the lordlings come and go.</p>
  
  <p>...  </p>
  
  <p>Gared had spent  forty years
  in the Night's Watch, man and boy, and he was not accustomed to being
  made light of.</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>""I've had the cold in me too, lordling."" Gared
  pulled back his hood, giving Ser Weymar a good long look at the stumps
  where his ears had been. ""Two ears, three toes, and the little finger
  off my left hand."" </p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>Gared glared at the lordling, the scares around
  his ear holes flushed red with anger where Master Aemon had cut the
  ears away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the end of the prologue, Royce is dead and Will is dying. Gared was waiting with the horses so it is more possible that he survived than the others.</p>

<p><strong>Bran</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But the man they found bound hand and foot to the holdfast wall
  awaiting the king's justice was old and scrawny, not much taller than
  Robb. He had lost both ears and a finger to frostbite, and he dressed
  all in black, the same as a brother of the Night's Watch, except that
  his furs were ragged and greasy.</p>

<h1>Can a sword be buried with the bearer?</h1>
<p>It can be. In <em>Dunk and Egg: The Hedge Knight</em>, Ser Duncan the Tall briefly contemplates against burying sword of his Master Ser Arlan of Pennytree with him, which implies that normal swords can be buried with their bearers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’d leave your sword, but it would rust in the ground,” he said at
last, apologetic. “The gods will give you a new one, I guess. I wish
you didn’t die, ser.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However special swords which are made of Valyrian steel aren't buried with their bearers. It is evident, by the fact, Valyrian Steel swords are inherited from Father to Son spanning over centuries e.g. Heartsbane, Long Claw, Blackfyre etc.</p>
<p>So it is unlikely that Widow's Wail was buried with Joffrey since none of the other Valyrian steel swords were buried with their bearers.</p>

<p><strong>Xaro:</strong> The door and the vault is made of Valyrian stone. The hardest steel does not make a mark.

<p>That said in the books there is the material called dragonstone which is probably what Valyrian Stone in the show is meant to be.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The heart of Old Volantis is the city-withinthe-city—an immense labyrinth of ancient palaces, courtyards, towers, temples, cloisters, bridges, and cellars, all contained within the great oval of the Black Walls raised by the Freehold of Valyria in the first flush of its youthful expansion. Two hundred feet tall, and so thick that six four-horse chariots can race along their battlements side by side (as they do each year to celebrate the founding of the city), <strong>these seamless walls of fused black dragonstone, harder than steel or diamond, stand in mute testimony to Volantis's origins as a military outpost.</strong></p>

"67995","Are there any royal jesters in song of ice and fire?","<p>An interesting question arose in my mind, since Martin actually keeps his books quite close to the medieval history.</p>

<p>Now, almost all medieval kings in Europe (and in my native Russia too, by the way) had such thing as royal jesters (not sure about the translation correctly, maybe they should be called king's fool or king's clown). Those were the comic person, that served as an independent conscience for the king.</p>

<p>That is, those persons were the only one, that were allowed to say even the most undesirable truth in king's face, in form of a joke, and they were not punished for that.</p>

<p>What about Westeros? None of the 5 kings seems to have someone like that around them. At purple wedding we saw the</p>

"68108","What exactly happened at Harenhal when Jaqen H'ghar went to the dungeons with Arya?","<p>In ACOK, while at Harenhal:</p>

<p>Arya ""tricks"" Jaqen H'ghar into helping her free the northmen from the dungeons to take the castle from Amory Lorch and his men. Jaqen reluctantly abides.</p>

<p>Then...</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> After they kill the dungeon guards and arrive back in the yard, Vargo Hoat and the Brave Companions have already started slaying Lorch's men, sellswords that they are, and it's clear they made a pact with Bolton to do so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question: </p>

<p>Was it pure coincidence that Arya/Jaqen's plan overlapped with Hoat/Bolton's plan? It wasn't clear to me whether Jaqen was going to play a part in this before Arya asked him.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>This is what AWOIAF says, but it just seems to coincidental to me:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Unknown to Ser Amory Lorch and independently of Arya and Jaqen, a deal has been struck by Vargo and Roose that Vargo is to turn over the castle. The Brave Companions turn on their former Lannister allies, killing many in their beds. <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Sack_of_Harrenhal"">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","68151","<p>It was just a coincidence.</p>

<p>Vargo Hoat had made a deal in which he brought Robett Glover's men into the dungeons, with the goal being to loose them later to take the castle.  When Arya frees them; both their condition and Glover's comments indicate they were not just prisoners:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once freed, the captives stripped the dead guards of their weapons and
  darted up the steps with steel in hand.  Their fellows crowded after
  them, bare-handed.  They went swiftly, and with scarcely a word.  None
  of them seemed quite so badly wounded as they had when Vargo Hoat
  marched them through the gates of Harrenhal.  ""This of the soup, that
  was clever,"" the man Glover was saying.  ""I did not expect that.  Was
  it Lord Hoat's idea?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Arya, Jaqen, Rorge, and Biter luckily enough are therefore in a position to switch to the winning side:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Who are you men?"" A crease appeared between Robett Glover's brows. 
  ""You were not with Hoat when he came to Lord Bolton's encampment.  Are
  you of the brave companions?""  </p>
  
  <p>Rorge wiped the snot off his chin with the back of his hand.  ""We are now.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ""...now"" indicates that Rorge (et al) are taking advantage of the situation to switch to the winning side.  And note that the backstory is clarified there - ""with Hoat when he came to Lord Bolton"" helps indicate how this came about.</p>

<p>And Jaqen makes sure that Arya (and the reader) fully understand:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...Jaqen H'ghar knelt beside Arya.  ""A girl does not understand?""  </p>
  
  <p>""Yes I do,"" she said, though she didn't, not truly.   </p>
  
  <p>The Lorathi must
  have seen it on her face.  ""A goat has no loyalty.  Soon a wolf banner
  is raised here, I think....""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's no indication in any of this that Jaqen had any advance information - recall, he only participated because Arya effectively threatened his life.  However, Jaqen seems to catch on to what's happening faster and more smoothly than the others - perhaps because a man sees, perhaps because he's always composed.</p>

<p>Had they reached the wall then they would have passed through a brutal indoctrination and training regime. This would either have made them functional members or killed them. If they deserted, what was the loss? They would be recaptured and executed. Killing of fellow legionaries presupposes that those legionaries would allow this to happen.</p>

<p>So, I was wondering: In the books, is anything revealed about the prior relationship the two had, and why such a rift would have developed between them?  And indeed, if such a rift existed, why would she follow him at all and marry into a kingdom whose people she initially hated?  I really don't mind being spoiled; I have no plans as yet to read the books on my own.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","3702","<p>Much of the back story is made clear in the books.  Viserys has always been arrogant and cruel toward his sister.  Some of it is probably hereditary.  The Targaryens had a long ""tradition"" of marrying brother to sister, which accounts for their distinctive hair and eye color, and occasional cases of madness.  Viserys's father Aerys Targaryen was called the ""Mad King"" and for very good reasons.  He was obsessed with fire, he abused his wife, and he burned Ned Stark's father and brother alive.</p>

<p>So you have a boy whose father was a king and a paranoid schizophrenic, who is a product of a long history of incest, who lost his parents at a young age, and who is raised by strangers on the stories about how he is really the rightful king of a vast kingdom, and how that kingdom was stolen from him.  Oh, and unlike Daenerys, he is not very bright.  Also, Viserys is resentful that he does not get to marry Daenerys himself, as is the custom of his family.</p>

<p>On the other hand Daenerys puts up with him until the very end for the same reason children put up with abusive parents.  She was born after her father was killed by Jaime Lannister, and her mother died in childbirth.  Viserys is the only family she has, and the only family she has ever known.</p>

<p>And, yes, you do have to keep in mind that all the children are older in the series than in the books.  In the book Dany is only 13 when she is married to Khal Drogo.</p>

<p>Also, do not forget that much of what is ""regular"" today was not at all regular during the medieval times.</p>

"68794","Who are the 3 men who would have a chance against Jaime Lannister in a sword fight?","<p>In <em>Game of Thrones</em> season 2, episode 8, &quot;The Prince of Winterfell&quot;, Jaime Lannister says to Brienne:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me [in a sword fight]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Who are those three people?</strong></p>
<p><div class=""youtube-embed""><div>
                <iframe width=""640px"" height=""395px"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/tLIhcOm_0wY?start=86""></iframe>
            </div></div></p>
<p>I don't believe this quote, or any variation, appears in the books. There was this quote from <em>A Storm of Swords</em> when he is fighting Brienne:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She is stronger than I am.</p>
<p>The realization chilled him. Robert had been stronger than him, to be sure. The White Bull Gerold Hightower as well, in his heyday, and Ser Arthur Dayne. Amongst the living, Greatjon Umber was stronger, Strongboar of Crakehall most likely, both Cleganes for a certainty. The Mountain’s strength was like nothing human. It did not matter. With speed and skill, Jaime could beat them all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the books suggest that Jaime can beat anyone, though he is only referring to people of great strength, not necessarily of great skill (somebody such as Barristan Selmy, who is not considered to be exceptionally strong but is exceptionally skillful, may be able to beat him).</p>
<p>Is there any canon evidence to suggest who these three people may be?</p>
<p>I won't accept any purely speculative answers. However if there is no direct canon quote answering the question (which I believe to be the case) I will consider answers that are strongly inferred from canonical sources (such as a canon quote saying X is the greatest fighter in the kingdom, for example).</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","68803","<p>I'm going to have to agree with the answer they gave when this question was posed on the Movies &amp; TV Stack Exchange: <strong>there's no way to tell</strong>. Jaime never says who the three men are, and without the benefit of his internal monologue, we'll never know for sure. The only person Jaime had ever fought at this point in the show is Ned, who is already dead.</p>

<p>But if we had to make a guess based on the books, I can think of a few possibilities. It's possible the screenwriter had based the line off of the section you quoted above. Of the four men who are stronger than Jaime AND currently alive, three have been depicted in the show: <strong>Greatjon Umber and the Cleganes</strong>.</p>

<p>Another possibility is that there are three people who are confirmed in the books to have beaten Jaime Lannister in a tourney match: <strong>Loras Tyrell</strong> on Joffrey's nameday, <strong>Jorah Mormount</strong> after the Greyjoy Rebellion, and <strong>Sandor Clegane</strong> in celebration of Ned being named Hand of the King. The only problem with this interpretation is that Mormount is not ""in the kingdoms.""</p>

<p>Another interpretation might be that Jaime is thinking of people who have beaten him, broadly speaking. In that case, Jorah Mormount could be replaced with <strong>Robb Stark</strong>, who outsmarted and captured him earlier in the war.</p>

<p>I guess it's worth noting that any way you slice it, Sandor Clegane makes the cut. Good for him!</p>

"142631","What did Varys do to the Sorcerer?","<p>Either right before or right after the battle of the Blackwater Varys tells Tyrion that a Sorcerer castrated him and used his genitals to perform a ritual. In S03E04 Varys reveals a man in a crate to Tyrion and Tyrion assumes that it is the Sorcerer. After this we never see the Sorcerer and it is never brought up again until Kinvara speaks to Varys about it, but it is rather a one sided conversation. So what actually happens to the Sorcerer? Varys mentions in season six that he hates torturing people but are we meant to believe that he made an exception for the Sorcerer? Even if we are never given a straight answer I would be happy with any implications we could draw from the evidence given.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","142693","<h1>Show</h1>
<p>As you mention, in the show he appears in just one episode of season 3. Afterwards there is no mention of what happened to the man.</p>
<p>The complete dialogue will help build some context for our readers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Varys</strong>: As a boy, I travelled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities. One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too
tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some
men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a
potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to
dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem,
chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames
turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call.</p>
<p>I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I
dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A
conjuror's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice
answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those
who practice it.</p>
<p>But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis
and his Red Priestess. A symbolic revenge of sorts.</p>
<p><strong>Tyrion:</strong> Yes, ahem. <strong>I feel</strong>
<strong>the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to</strong>
<strong>have me killed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Varys:</strong> Which will require a degree of influence, which ... You do not possess
at the moment. <strong>But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have</strong>
<strong>found.</strong></p>
<p>Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose, he threw me out of his house
to die.</p>
<p><strong>I resolved to live to spite him</strong>. I begged. I sold what parts of my
body remained to me. I became an excellent thief and soon learned that
the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of
his purse. Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my
way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber.</p>
<p>Influence grows like a weed. <strong>I tended mine patiently</strong> until its
tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side
of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very
special. The sorcerer.</p>
<p><strong>Hello, my old friend. It's been a long time</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, Varys tells Tyrion that he fought Stannis and the Red Woman to have a symbolic revenge on sorcerers; however Tyrion feels the need to exact an actual revenge on the King's Guard who tried to kill him. On that Varys tells him that he needs to be patient to have that kind of influence and mentions that he has found out that influence grows with patience, implying that he himself garnered that kind of influence after being patient for decades and now he was finally on cusp of exacting his revenge.</p>
<p>So one thing is clear, the man's fate wasn't pleasant. He would have been killed in the end, to be sure, however I don't think Varys would have allowed him the mercy of a quick death after so patiently waiting for the day to exact his revenge for years. He must have given him a very slow, very painful death.</p>
<p>Also a Reddit <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/2ctyvb/season_3_spoilers_what_did_varys_do_with_the/cjj6sca"" rel=""noreferrer"">comment</a> that I think is helpful here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Varys didn't just happen to conveniently have his tormentor taken
there the same time a relevant discussion about it happened to come
up.</p>
<p>I interpreted the scene as though the man had been held captive for
quite awhile. The &quot;wasn't gonna be something nice&quot; action that Varys
took was keeping the man alive in a small box for an indeterminate
amount of time.</p>
<p>I feel like it completely went over people's heads that the &quot;revenge&quot;
was trapping the guy and keeping him barely alive, as opposed to just
killing him.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h1>Books</h1>
<p>In the books, however Varys never managed to capture the Sorcerer. He mentioned that story before the Battle of Blackwater Bay, as opposed to the show where he tells that story to Tyrion after the battle.</p>
<p>In <em>ACOK, Tyrion X</em>, he tells Tyrion about the day he was cut to explain to him that he suspects that Stannis dabbles with Dark arts and therefore Varys wants him dead. It was more or less the same as the TV show and it is an awfully large passage so I'd not be including it here.</p>
<p>In any case, in the books, Varys hasn't done anything to the Sorcerer. At least not anything that we know of since the Eunuch is extremely secretive about his personal life and doesn't have a POV chapter.</p>

"142668","How did Daenerys know about the ""Hand of the King"" pin?","<p>In the season finale of season 6 of Game of Thrones</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>Daenerys presents Tyrion with a ""Hand of the Queen"" pin.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She says something along the lines of ""I hope I got the details right.""</p>

<p>It is unlikely that she asked Tyrion himself about it as he seems surprised to be receiving it. It is possible that she asked Jorah about it but we don't really see them alone and they likely have not spoken off screen since maybe half way through season 5. Even if she did ask him about it, it seems unlikely that Jorah would have ever even seen the ""Hand of the King"" pin.</p>

<p>So my question is, how did Daenerys know what the ""Hand of the King"" pin looked like? Both the Westerosi Hand of the King pin and the Hand of the Queen pin that Daenerys gives to Tyrion look very similar considering that Daenerys has never spent a day of her adult life in Westeros.</p>

<p>Are we supposed to believe that she asked Varys before he left?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","142691","<h1>Books</h1>
<p>First of all, this is a show only event. It has never happened in the books as Books ended when the Dothraki found Daenerys. Later, in absence of the Queen, Ser Barristan Selmy assumed the office of Hand of the King to govern the realm. From <em>ADWD, Chapter 59</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though <strong>he had assumed the title of Hand, Ser Barristan would not
presume to hold court in the queen's absence</strong>, nor would he permit
Skahaz mo Kandaq to do such.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However since you have added the books tag, Books do refer to how she got her knowledge of Westeros. From <em>AGOT, Chapter 46:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My mother died giving me birth, and my father and my brother Rhaegar
even before that. <strong>I would never have known so much as their names if
Viserys had not been there to tell me</strong>. He was the only one left. The
only one. He is all I have</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also from <em>AGOT Daenerys VI</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>She had never seen the Seven Kingdoms either, no more than Drogo, yet she felt as though she knew them from all the tales her brother
had told her</strong>. Viserys had promised her a thousand times that he
would take her back one day, but he was dead now and his promises had
died with him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Viserys had even told her about the Tourneys. From <em>ADWD Daenerys V</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;One would be enough if he were as true as you.&quot; The day might come
soon when she would have need of every knight. &quot;Will they joust for
me? I should like that.&quot; <strong>Viserys had told her stories of the
tourneys he had witnessed in the Seven Kingdoms, but Dany had never
seen a joust herself</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also from <em>AGOT, Daenerys I</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Yet sometimes Dany would picture the way it had been, so often had her brother told her the stories</strong>. The midnight flight to
Dragonstone, moonlight shimmering on the ship's black sails.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Viserys also told her about the Targaryen custom of incest. From <em>AGOT, Daenerys I:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>She had always assumed that she would wed Viserys when she came of
age. For centuries the Targaryens had married brother to sister, since
Aegon the Conqueror had taken his sisters to bride. <strong>The line must be
kept pure, Viserys had told her a thousand times; theirs was the
kingsblood, the golden blood of old Valyria, the blood of the
dragon</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also told her about History of House Targaryen's dragons. From <em>AGOT, Daenerys III:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Viserys had told her that the last Targaryen dragons had died no more than a century and a half ago</strong>, during the reign of Aegon III,
who was called the Dragonbane.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also from <em>ADWD, Daenerys II</em>, he told her about the Dance of the Dragons:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Viserys had told her all the tales when she was little</strong>. He loved to talk of dragons. She knew how Harrenhal had fallen. She knew about
the Field of Fire and the Dance of the Dragons. One of her forebears,
the third Aegon, had seen his own mother devoured by his uncle's
dragon. And there were songs beyond count of villages and kingdoms
that lived in dread of dragons till some brave dragonslayer rescued
them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was also Viserys, whose knowledge had saved Daenerys' dragons from starvation in <em>ACOK, Daenerys I</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Or rather, tried to feed them, for the dragons would not eat. They
would hiss and spit at each bloody morsel of horsemeat, steam rising
from their nostrils, yet <strong>they would not take the food . . . until
Dany recalled something Viserys had told her when they were
children</strong>.</p>
<p>Only dragons and men eat cooked meat, he had said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also told her about the Throne room and Dragon skulls that adorned the walls. From <em>ASOS, Daenerys I:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<strong>Viserys talked of those skulls</strong>,&quot; said Dany. &quot;The Usurper took
them down and hid them away. He could not bear them looking down on
him upon his stolen throne.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also told her about Tragedy of Summerhall. From <em>ASOS, Daenerys V</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Viserys had spoken of Rhaegar's birth only once</strong>. Perhaps the tale saddened him too much. &quot;It was the shadow of Summerhall that haunted
him, was it not?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also told her about theology and faith. From <em>ASOS, Daenerys VI:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Westeros had seven gods at least, though <strong>Viserys had told her that
some septons said the seven were only aspects of a single god</strong>, seven
facets of a single crystal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So here we see, Daenerys knows all she knows thanks to Viserys. To sum it up, following are the subjects Viserys told her about:</p>
<ol>
<li>Her self, Her rights and Her House</li>
<li>The tales of Seven Kingdoms</li>
<li>Customs and culture of Seven Kingdoms</li>
<li>History of House Targaryen</li>
<li>Some mysteries of Dragonlore</li>
<li>History of Dragons</li>
<li>Faith of the Seven Kingdoms</li>
</ol>
<p>So if this event does happen in the books, It would most likely be Viserys who would have told her about the pin and the office of Hand of the King.</p>
<hr />
<h1>Show</h1>
<p>There is no indication in the show that who told her about the office and its pin.</p>
<p>The exact dialogue in S06E10 was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Daenerys: I, um... <strong>I had something made for you. I'm not sure if
it's right</strong>. Tyrion Lannister, I name you Hand of the Queen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since she wasn't sure about the exact appearance having never seen the pin personally but yet had it made, that implies she did so with help of verbal description she may have heard from someone. Following are the candidates who may have told her about the pin custom:</p>
<ol>
<li>Viserys Targaryen</li>
<li>Jorah Mormont</li>
<li>Barristan Selmy</li>
<li>Tyrion Lannister</li>
</ol>
<p>The most plausible one of them is Viserys since he was the one who told Daenerys everything she knew.</p>

"208903","Can there be female White Walkers?","<p>I never saw a female White Walker in the TV show. As for Craster donating only his sons to White Walkers, there are two possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>White Walkers don't accept a female gift because they can't be converted.</p></li>
<li><p>Craster kept his daughters around so that he could have sex with them.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Which one's correct? Can there be female White Walkers?</p>

<p>Answers from books would be valid.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","208905","<p>TL;DR: We have the case of the Night's Queen who is spoken about in the books and appears in one of the Histories &amp; Lore videos in the show. Whilst she is spoken about as an Other/White Walker she could actually be a wight as it is never stated explicitly although I'd say the evidence points to her as being an Other/White Walker.</p>
<p>We also have evidence of some potential hybrid Other/human species in the books and in the show it is implied that Craster sacrificed some of his daughter wives as well as the sons.</p>
<h1>Game of Thrones</h1>
<p>There is mention of the “Night’s Queen” in the series though it is actually from one of the Histories &amp; Lore videos, as far as I’m aware nothing is mentioned in the main episodes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We Free Folk have our stories, too. About how one of your king crows found something cold in the woods... with bright blue eyes. How he brought her home, through your wall, and declared himself &quot;Night's King&quot;. For thirteen years he and his queen ruled over his brothers, making sacrifices as black as their cloaks. Lucky for you southerners, the Free Folk rallied to a King-Beyond-the-Wall, as we will when need be, and marched on the ancient castle he had taken as his own, the Nightfort. With the help of the Starks, we killed the demon and cleansed your precious watch. An' then they thanked us, an' kicked us back across the wall... as you always have.</p>

<p>From this all we know of her is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>she was “cold”</li>
<li>she had bright blue eyes</li>
<li>she was the Night’s King’s queen</li>
<li>she was killed by the Free Folk and Starks</li>
</ul>
<p>From this we know she got her title from being the Night’s King’s queen though there is no evidence that she actually had that title. From the description of her it could be said she was a White Walker but we don’t know for sure.</p>

<p>We also have a hint that in the show some of Craster's daughter wives contracted greyscale and that he took them out into the woods.

<h1>A Song of Ice and Fire</h1>
<p>In the books we have mention of the Night's Queen who was the downfall of the Night's King as the ruled at the Nightfort. It is <em>only</em> heavily implied that she was an Other but from the context of the story she probably was.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the sun began to set the shadows of the towers lengthened and the wind blew harder, sending gusts of dry dead leaves rattling through the yards. The gathering gloom put Bran in mind of another of Old Nan's stories, the tale of Night's King. He had been the thirteenth man to lead the Night's Watch, she said; a warrior who knew no fear. &quot;And that was the fault in him,&quot; she would add, &quot;for all men must know fear.&quot; A woman was his downfall; a woman glimpsed from atop the Wall, with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars. Fearing nothing, he chased her and caught her and loved her, though her skin was cold as ice, and when he gave his seed to her he gave his soul as well.</p>
<p>He brought her back to the Nightfort and proclaimed her a queen and himself her king, and with strange sorceries he bound his Sworn Brothers to his will. For thirteen years they had ruled, Night's King and his corpse queen, till finally the Stark of Winterfell and Joramun of the wildlings had joined to free the Watch from bondage. After his fall, when it was found he had been sacrificing to the Others, all records of Night's King had been destroyed, his very name forbidden.</p>
<p><sub><em>A Storm of Swords</em>, Bran IV</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That maesters themselves don't believe she was a &quot;corpse queen&quot; but probably someone from the Barrowlands which lends evidence to the fact that she may not have been an Other. Howevber, it's worth noting that the maesters seem to have pushed all of the supernatural away as folk stories and fairy tales and so their judgement in cases like this is clouded.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet over the thousands of years of its existence as the chief seat of the Watch, the Nightfort has accrued many legends of its own, some of which have been recounted in Archmaester Harmune's Watchers on the Wall. The oldest of these tales concern the legendary Night's King, the thirteenth Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, who was alleged to have bedded a sorceress pale as a corpse and declared himself a king. For thirteen years the Night's King and his &quot;corpse queen&quot; ruled together, before King of Winter, Brandon the Breaker, (in alliance, it is said, with the King-Beyond-the-Wall, Joramun) brought them down. Thereafter, he obliterated the Night's King's very name from memory.</p>
<p>In the Citadel, the archmaesters largely dismiss these tales—though some allow that there may have been a Lord Commander who attempted to carve out a kingdom for himself in the earliest days of the Watch. Some suggest that perhaps the corpse queen was a woman of the Barrowlands, a daughter of the Barrow King who was then a power in his own right, and oft associated with graves. The Night's King has been said to have been variously a Bolton, a Woodfoot, an Umber, a Flint, a Norrey, or even a Stark, depending on where the tale is told. Like all tales, it takes on the attributes that make it most appealing to those who tell it.</p>
<p><sub><em>The World of Ice and Fire</em>, The Wall and Beyond: The Night’s Watch</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is worth noting that Old Nan states that the wildling woman would lay with the Others and a hybrid species were created which could have been what the Night's Queen was.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The man had been taken outside a small holdfast in the hills. Robb thought he was a wildling, his sword sworn to Mance Rayder, the King-beyond-the-Wall. It made Bran's skin prickle to think of it. He remembered the hearth tales Old Nan told them. The wildlings were cruel men, she said, slavers and slayers and thieves. They consorted with giants and ghouls, stole girl children in the dead of night, and drank blood from polished horns. And their women lay with the Others in the Long Night to sire terrible half-human children.</p>

"4145","Why did Robb not pursue alternative ways of crossing the river in ""Baelor""?","<p>In the ""Baelor"" episode of Game of Thrones, I was confused when the Starks had to negotiate with the Frey clan in order to cross the river. Was there no other way across the river? Did they not have boats or enough resources to quickly build a bridge?</p>

<p>Is this explained better in the books?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","4150","<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VoOqm.jpg"" alt=""The Riverlands"">
Here's a closeup map of the Riverlands. Robb Stark's host was moving south from the Grey&#x200a;<strong>water</strong> Watch (mislabeled in the image) which is at the very top of map. They needed to go South towards Riverrun, which is the House Tully seat being besieged by Jaime Lannister (very bottom of the map). To do that they needed to cross the Green Fork, which was flooding at the time, so the only way to cross was to use the bridge spanning the Twins or go much farther south along the river, exposing them to Lannister troops and wasting valuable time. Hence the need to negotiate with Lord Walder Frey.</p>

<p>Relevant book passage (pp. 640-641 in my paperback copy in a Catelyn chapter):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Theon shook his head. ""The river's running high and fast. Ser Brynden says it can't be forded, not this far north""</p>
  
  <p>""I <em>must</em> have that crossing!"" Robb declared, fuming. ""Oh, our horses might be able to swim the river, I suppose, but not with armored men on their backs. We'd need to build rafts to pole our steel across, helms and mail and lances, and we don't have the trees for that. <em>Or</em> the time. Lord Typwin is marching north..."" He balled his hand into a fist.</p>
  
  <p>""Lord Frey would be a fool to try and bar our way,"" Theon Greyjoy said with his customary easy confidence. ""We have five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you need to, Robb.""</p>
  
  <p>""Not easily,"" Catelyn warned them, ""and not in time. While you were mounting your siege, Tywin Lannister would bring up his host and assault you from the rear""</p>

"69082","Why didn't Cersei want Eddard Stark dead?","<p>I think Eddard Stark with knowledge of twincest would be far more dangerous, compared to possible reaction of North for a dead Eddard Stark. Especially when his heir was a 'kid' (Robb). Sending him to the Wall would not solve the problem because, as we see with Benjen Stark; he could still visit Winterfell and tell everyone what he knows.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><politics>","69129","<p>It's very important that Cersei didn't <strong>only</strong> send Eddard to the Wall; she required him to publicly confess to treason. On the steps of the Great Sept, Eddard told the crowd that he had tried to seize the throne for himself, and Joffrey was the legitimate son of Cersei and King Robert.</p>

<p>If Eddard had gone to the Wall as planned, but later spoken out against Cersei, he would have two major problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>Brothers of the Night's Watch are not permitted to take part in the politics of the Seven Kingdoms. If Eddard opposed Cersei, he would be breaking his vows and endangering the NW as a whole (because it depends for its long-term survival on neutrality in any conflicts which take place in the south). If necessary, the other NW brothers might have taken steps to stop him from interfering in politics.</li>
<li>Eddard would effectively be saying that his solemn confession of treason was a lie told to save his own life. Cersei could then say the confession was true, and Eddard was telling lies because he still wanted the Iron Throne for himself. Either way, Eddard was lying. So his reputation as an extremely honourable man is ruined, which would greatly reduce his authority.</li>
</ul>

<p>The other reason Cersei wanted Eddard to live, is that the Lannisters were facing a civil war against Renly and Stannis. If Eddard was allowed to join the Night's Watch, Robb Stark might be persuaded to remain neutral in the war, allowing the Lannisters to deal with their other enemies. If instead Eddard was executed, Robb and the other northern lords would almost certainly go to war.</p>

<p>As it turns out,</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Eddard is killed and this is exactly what happens. Eddard was a very popular leader in the North, so the northern lords were almost as angry as Robb, and more than willing to support a war against the Lannnisters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So allowing Eddard to live was a calculated risk, but one Cersei was willing to take.</p>

"209049","Does everyone believe in trial by combat?","<p>In the world of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> trial by combat is a very common way of trial. But in the events of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> this way of trial has been found wrong many times. One example is Tyrion found guilty even when he didn't murder Joffrey. So does everyone believe in trial by combat (that it is blessed by god so that the right person emerges victorious)? Or is it just a way for the stronger persons to escape their penalty? </p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","209072","<p>There's not enough evidence in the books to say whether <em>everyone</em> believes in trial by combat (or at least, everyone who believes in the Seven; I think it's an Andal thing, at least in this form, perhaps people who follow the Old Gods have something else). What we do know is:</p>

<ol>
<li>It's an old tradition. Most people aren't going to speak out against an old tradition.</li>
<li>Any noble who thinks they're likely to lose in a regular trial has the right to demand trial by combat instead. Therefore it's in the interest of the ruling class to preserve this option.</li>
<li>It's meant for cases where the facts aren't immediately clear. Therefore it's going to be hard to say ""Look, the trial produced the wrong result!"" <em>We</em> know that Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey, but it's not that clear-cut to the characters.</li>
<li>It's not really about the facts anyway, it's about the will of the gods, which is mysterious. That is, if I'm accused of stealing a bagel, and then I win my trial by combat, it doesn't mean I didn't steal the bagel; it means that either the gods approve of me stealing the bagel, or else they have some other punishment in mind for me, that they will take care of. So for someone who's a believer in the Seven, the trial literally <em>can't</em> produce the wrong result. If it seems wrong, well, so do a lot of things that happen in life and the gods are responsible for those too.</li>

"4378","Why is Daenerys unharmed after the events of ""Fire and Blood""?","<p>In the ""Baelor"" and ""Fire and Blood"" episodes of <em>Game of Thrones</em>, I was confused by Daenerys's story.

<blockquote>
  <p>This isn't Westereos where men honor blood. Here they only honor strength. There will be fighting here after Drogo dies. Whoever wins that fight will be the new Khal. He won't want any rivals. Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs.</p>

<p>And later:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We could have been 10 miles away from here by now on the way to Asshai. You would have been safe.  </p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","142925","<h3>What happens when a Grand Maester is murdered</h3>
<p>This isn't the first time that Grand Maester was executed by the Monarch or ruling authority. King Maegor had three Grand Maesters executed in his brief reign alone. There is list of precedent for that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Grand Maester <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Gawen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gawen</a>: Executed by King Maegor, for speaking in favor of ascension of Prince Aegon (Son of Aenys I) to the throne, by beheading.</li>
<li>Grand Maester <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Gerardys"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gerardys</a>: Fed by King Aegon II to his royal dragon, Sunfyre.</li>
<li>Grand Maester <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Hareth_(maester)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hareth</a>: Executed for treason by an unknown King.</li>
</ol>
<p>Everytime a Grand Maester was killed, Citadel did send a new one to the King. Citadel does not command any swords or soldiers so they can't possibly defy the royal commands or criticize the actions without fear of meeting the same fate.</p>
<p>The Citadel does object on dismissal of a Grand Maester however, there seem to have been no objections raised after their execution. From <em>ASOS, Tyrion XII</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Not at all, my lord. Thank the archmaesters of Oldtown, those who
wished to insist on Pycelle's restoration on the grounds that <strong>only
the Conclave may make or unmake a Grand Maester</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>Bloody fools, thought Tyrion. &quot;<strong>I seem to recall that Maegor the
Cruel's headsman unmade three with his axe<sup>1</sup></strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quite true,&quot; Varys said. &quot;And the second Aegon fed Grand Maester
Gerardys to his dragon.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not to mention, these objections were based on legal rights of the conclave, they weren't an act of defiance or criticism of the regime. E.g. That would be like a King taking a stream away from me and me saying &quot;But your Grace, your own Royal father granted that stream to me for perpetuity. That is my right as per the feudal contract&quot;. The hostile action would be &quot;Oh may others take you! You blackhearted rogue, you are no King of mine. I will not pay any taxes unless my stream is restored to me&quot;. See the difference?</p>
<p>Anyhow every time the execution happened, the Citadel chose a new one and sent him forth which is evident by the fact that Maegor executed three of consecutive grand Maesters which implies that three must have been sent to him as replacement of the previously executed one.</p>
<h3>Will Citadel be reluctant?</h3>
<p>By precedent, it is unlikely.</p>
<p>However, it is not as simple as historic cases here.</p>
<p>Cersei's rule is <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/133037/can-cersei-lannister-claim-the-iron-throne-and-legitimize-her-act/133040#133040"">currently unrecognized</a> by most <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/133169/where-do-the-regions-of-westeros-appear-to-align-as-of-the-season-6-finale/133170#133170"">powerful lords of seven Kingdoms</a>.</p>
<p>Citadel is located in Old Town, which is under suzreinity of Tyrells of High Garden. Seeing as Tyrells have raised their banners in favor of Daenerys, it is very likely that Citadel may not send a new Grand Maester to Cersei and refuse to recognize her as the Queen given that they are now protected by the might of High Garden, something which wasn't true back in the day of the Dragon Kings.</p>
<p>Remember, one of the titles of Lord Hightower of Oldtown is <em>Defender of the Citadel</em>. Since his overlords, The Tyrells of High Garden are in open rebellion<sup>2</sup>, it appears to be unlikely that Citadel, emboldened by protection of Hightowers and Tyrells would send a Grand Maester to King's Landing.</p>
<h3>A symbol of legitimacy and its impacts on Tyrell goals</h3>
<p>Being served by Grand Maester is a sign of legitimacy and providing that to Cersei instead of Daenerys would be detrimental to Tyrell goals here.</p>
<p>From <em>The Princess and the Queen</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Every visible symbol of legitimacy belonged to Aegon</strong>. He sat the Iron
Throne. He lived in the Red Keep. He wore the Conquerer’s crown,
wielded the Conquerer’s sword, and had been anointed by a septon of
the Faith before the eyes of tens of thousands. <strong>Grand Maester Orwyle
sat in his councils</strong>, and the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard had
placed the crown upon his princely head. And he was male, which in the
eyes of many made him the rightful king, his half sister the usurper.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><sub>1. Tyrion appears to be wrong in his memories here. At least Gawen was executed by the King himself with Blackfyre, not by his Axeman.</sub>
<br>
<sub>2. As far as Tyrells are concerned, they are in rebellion. They have sent forces to Daenerys. Cersei isn't that much of an idiot to delude herself that Tyrells will accept her rule after her murder of Lord Tyrell and his children. Daenerys isn't going to waste her time in stopping for camps. She has to reach her destination fast and strike hard, due to rules of logistics. Tyrells don't even need to hide their rebellion as Cersei's rule is unrecognized by great lords and there is no danger from the remnants of Lannister army, battered and tired from a long war.</sub></p>

 Later, during a celebration (Joffrey's wedding I think), Tyrion strongly hinted to Joffrey that he knew all about his role in the assassination attempt. Joffrey's demeanor changed, which confirmed it in Tyrion's mind. But of course he never confessed. </p>

<p>Bronn is an amoral and selfish sellsword. When is introduced to the story, he is a freerider more interested in his own comfort and gold than whether others simply live. Much later in the story, he admitted the only reason he saved Jaime Lannister from a dragon's breath was so that Jaime could stay alive until Bronn got his castle from the Lannisters.</p>
<p>He is not moved by claims of honor, so a trial by combat over the rights and honors of hated dwarf of a hated family should hold no appeal to him. I could see him amused to watch Tyrion face combat, but that would be short lived entertainment. I could not see him wishing to participate in that trial.</p>
<p>If he loses, he might die. Defeated but still alive, he might be maimed for life and reviled by the knights of the Vale. If he is maimed, his career as a freeriding sellsword will be cut short.</p>

<p>Both outcomes have very negative outcomes for him. Neither outcome of the trial has a positive outcome.</p>

<p>“The thing is, you did not know the Starks. Lord Eddard is a proud, honorable, and honest man, and his lady wife is worse. Oh, no doubt she would have found a coin or two for you when this was all over, and pressed it in your hand with a polite word and a look of distaste, but that’s the most you could have hoped for. The Starks look for courage and loyalty and honor in the men they choose to serve them, and if truth be told, you and Chiggen were lowborn scum.”...</p>
<p>My pardons … but you are scum, Bronn, make no mistake. Duty, honor, friendship, what’s that to you? No, don’t trouble yourself, we both know the answer. Still, you’re not stupid. Once we reached the Vale, Lady Stark had no more need of you … but I did, and the one thing the Lannisters have never lacked for is gold. When the moment came to toss the dice, I was counting on your being smart enough to know where your best interest lay. Happily for me, you did.”...</p>
<p>“Scum you may be, but you’re undeniably useful, and with a sword in your hand you’re almost as good as my brother Jaime. What do you want, Bronn? Gold? Land? Women? Keep me alive, and you’ll have it.” Bronn blew gently on the fire, and the flames leaped up higher. “And if you die?” “Why then, I’ll have one mourner whose grief is sincere,” Tyrion said, grinning. “The gold ends when I do.”</p>

"209550","Why isn't everyone flabbergasted about Bran's ""gift""?","<p>Bran has become the three-eyed raven, and can see anything that has happened in history using his mind's eye. This is an incredible gift that takes place in a world in which people doubt the existence of dragons, giants, and white walkers.</p>

<p>People are a bit confused when they learn about Bran's gift, or seem a bit annoyed by his oddness, but are otherwise not too bothered. They react to Bran's gift as if they had just seen an unusually large goat.</p>

<p>This really came to the forefront in season 8. Bran claims in front of a large audience including Daenerys that the night king has breached the wall and has one of her dragons. He later speaks in front of the war council in Episode 2, during which many people are present,
some who barely know Bran. He speaks of the night king and being the three-eyed raven and the end of the world etc., and no one seems especially concerned. </p>

<p>We have no indication that these individuals are even aware of Bran's gift, let alone why they're so comfortable with it. They also acknowledge his visions and use them to dictate their plans. If I was in the room I would be saying: WAIT, what is he talking about, how does he know these things, how can we believe him, and why aren't we more curious about this super wizard? </p>

<p>Why isn't everyone flabbergasted about Bran's ""gift""? This is unlike anything anyone has ever encountered and is beyond comprehension, yet no one seems particularly perturbed.</p>

<p>I'm using the word ""flabbergasted"", but I'm also curious why people aren't more interested, questioning, curious, surprised, affected, etc.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","209558","<p>Who in Winterfell at this point would be flabbergasted by Bran's gifts?</p>

<p>Many things have happened in the world of GOT in the last 7 years (in GOT universe time).</p>

<p>Most people in Winterfell have either seen white walkers or believe they exist because so many others have seen them.</p>

<p>The free men from beyond the wall are all familiar with magic, such as some people having gifts to allow them to take control of animals.</p>

<p>Anyone who rode with Stannis saw the powers of the Red Witch.</p>

<p>Varys lost his genitals to a magic user, who used the flesh to summon something in a fire.</p>

<p>There is also plenty of evidence that some people of Westeros are believers anyways. Even Cersei visited the blood witch Maggi and was haunted by her prophecies.</p>

<p>And Northmen by way of their religion are even more likely to be believers in magic and particularly greenseers. Just look at Jojen Reed.</p>

<p>Add to this that Bran Stark is a Lord of Winterfell and therefore more likely to be believed than a commoner, and I think it would be more strange for people not to believe him at this point.</p>

"209561","Why do people think Winterfell crypts is the safest place for women, children and old people?","<p>In <em>Game of Thrones</em> S08E02 ""A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms"", it is repeatedly mentioned by multiple characters (I counted six) that when the Night King and the Army of the Dead attack, the Winterfell crypts are the safest place to be for women, children and old people.    </p>

<p>But why is that? As far as I can see, it's got a single way down with lots of steps and poorly lit. If the dead win, the people there will be slaughtered with no way out. In any other place, they would have a chance to run at least. </p>

<p>Why would this be the safest place?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","209563","<p>It is the safest place while the battle rages on, similar to the Battle of Helm's Deep in LOTR: while in the crypt/cave, the non-combatant are out of harms way, and in no risk of being hit by a stray projectile or shrapnel. Plus, if the defenses are breached, then there is no risk of any number of civilians falling in the hands of the enemy to be slaughtered and join the Army of the Dead.</p>

<p>Of course, if they lose the battle, then everyone dies, but that's why they are fighting in the first place: to avoid being wiped out.</p>

<p>If they win, then the civilians, used in the modern sense opposed to military people, are safe and sound and can tend to the wounded combatants who survived the battle and start rebuilding and such.</p>

<p>As for running, it's highly unlikely that the women, children and old people would go very far before being caught by the Army of the Dead and slaughtered in the open fields. Especially since winter has finally come. There is no running from the Army of the Dead. Besides, from a strategic standpoint, any way out is also a potential way in.</p>

"143176","Where did the allegiance of Baratheon swords lie and why aren't they bulk of Royal Forces?","<p>I am just generally confused about the Baratheon army during season 1 and 2 of Game of Thrones. As far as we know there isn't a single Baratheon troop in King's landing during season 1. We see that the royal escort in episode 1 is backed by the Lannister troops. Even Joffrey's sworn shield, The Hound, is from a house that is sworn to the Lannisters.</p>

<p>As Robert is dying however, Renly tells Ned that he can have one hundred swords at his command by nightfall. Are we meant to believe that he was referring to the city watch? Beric Dondarrion attends court at Kingslanding so we know that there were more than zero Baratheon soldiers in the Crownlands.</p>

<p>In Season Two it appears that all of the Baratheon troops have declared for Stannis,the defending force at Blackwater is made up entirely of Lannisters and there are no longer any Baratheons fighting for Joffrey.</p>

<p>Why was the Crowns force made up of Lannisters and not Bartheons?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><laws>","143193","<h3>Robert's acts after his Coronation</h3>

<p>When Robert became King, he issued two edicts:</p>

<ol>
<li>Grant of Storms's End and Paramount Lordship of ancestral Baratheon lands (Stormlands) to Renly Baratheon.</li>
<li>Grant of Dragonstone and it's incomes and lands to Stannis Baratheon.</li>
</ol>

<p>By these acts:</p>

<ol>
<li>He separated the senior Branch of House Baratheon as House Baratheon of King's Landing. </li>
<li>He laid foundation of a cadet dynasty, House Baratheon of Storm's End.</li>
<li>He laid foundation of another cadet dynasty, House Baratheon of Dragonstone.</li>
</ol>

<p>So for all intents and purposes, House Baratheon of King's Landing was now a symbol of unity of the Kingdoms and had nothing to do with Stormlands at all as the Lords of Stormlands were now sworn to Renly Baratheon. That does not mean that Robert didn't have his own contingent of Stormlander sworn swords, who were sworn directly to the crown, not to Renly. </p>

<h3>Escort in Episode 1</h3>

<p>You are wrong when you suggest that the escort was made entirely of Lannister soldiers. The ones leading the escort were Baratheon men at arms, holding banners of the King while the Lannisters behind them were flying colors of House Lannister. Take a look below:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/X6QnO.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/X6QnO.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>As you can see, Baratheon soldiers are leading the party. If it is still not easy to differentiate, see this close up, Baratheon soldier in front and Lannister man behind:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/meVwD.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/meVwD.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Moreover, Baratheon men with antlers on their helms formed the line on gates before the Royals entered the castle proper with King's guards. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YoAH.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YoAH.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>More Baratheon soldiers spilled in with the King, pushing aside the Stark men who were standing on the left side of the gate and took positions:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iv7dq.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iv7dq.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>You can see the full video <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVVgASDz8pM"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>. </p>

<p>Lannister men in the escort are due to alliance between the Lion and the stag. Lord Tywin Lannister had 100+ soldiers given to Cersei presumably when she married Robert, to act as her guards and obey her every command. In Books, their captain is <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Vylarr"" rel=""noreferrer"">Vylarr</a>, in show his name is not mentioned. </p>

<p>In the books the escort is described as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The visitors poured through the castle gates in a <strong>river of gold</strong>
  and silver and polished steel, three hundred strong, a pride of
  bannermen and knights, of sworn swords and freeriders. Over their
  heads <strong>a dozen golden banners whipped back</strong> and forth in the
  northern wind, <strong>emblazoned with the crowned stag of Baratheon</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The golden color is the chosen color for livery of Baratheon men at arms. </p>

<h3>Why is Sandor sworn shield of Joffrey?</h3>

<p>The Hound left his ancestral keep when his brother succeeded his father, never to return. He went to Casterly Rock who accepted his service. Later he went to King's Landing, presumably on orders of Lord Tywin since Hound was sworn to him and wasn't likely to take orders from someone else. </p>

<p>Prince Joffrey was quite fond of Sandor Clegane. It isn't mentioned how did Hound become his sworn shield but I would speculate that it was due to insistence of the Prince himself. This is further reinforced when Joff dismisses Barristan Selmy so that Hound could take his place as King's Guard. </p>

<h3>What did Renly mean by 100 swords?</h3>

<p>By Hundred Swords, Renly didn't mean he was reforming the Watch. He didn't have many soldiers himself except a small guards retinue, as his power was in Storm's End, not King's landing. He meant to assemble guards retinues from his friends like Ser Loras Tyrell and give their command to Eddard, if he agrees to act against Cersei and her children. Lord Eddard however refused and Renly saw no choice but to flee.</p>

<p>He didn't have 100 swords however. Following is how the event happened in Season 1 Episode 7:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Eddard:</strong> Is Lord Renly joining us? </p>
  
  <p><strong>Varys:</strong> I fear Lord Renly has left the city. <strong>He rode through the old gate an hour before dawn with Ser Loras Tyrell and some 50
  retainers</strong>. Last seen galloping South in some haste.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the books, this is how the event transpired:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Left the city?"" Ned had counted on Renly's support.</p>
  
  <p>""<strong>He took his leave through a postern gate an hour before dawn,
  accompanied by Ser Loras Tyrell and some fifty retainers</strong>,"" Varys
  told them. ""When last seen, they were galloping south in some haste,
  no doubt bound for Storm's End or Highgarden.""</p>
  
  <p>So much for Renly and his hundred swords.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Why was Beric Dondarrion there?</h3>

<p>Beric Dondarrion was there for the Hand's Tourney and just happened to be in the court when Ned gave him command to kill the Mountain. If that hadn't happened, he would have returned to his seat at Black Haven in Dornish Marches. </p>

<h3>Why are crown's forces made up of Lannisters?</h3>

<p>That isn't true. King's Landing's defense is responsibility of the Gold cloaks aka city watch. There is a small contingent of Lannister guards however under command of the Queen. </p>

<p>The Baratheon men may have deserted in wake of King Robert's death and escape of Lord Renly. </p>

<p>In any case, it was the City Watch, aided by Lannister guards who defended the city against Baratheons when Stannis attacked, at least in the books. In the show, The role of city watch in the defense is given very little air time (If any). </p>

<p>The Crown's Forces are made up of:</p>

<ol>
<li>Gold Cloaks. Any Westerosi can join the Gold Cloaks however, most of them are locals of King's Landing. </li>
<li>The levies drawn from Lords of Crownlands who are direct vassals to the King. </li>
</ol>

<p>If Robert were to dismiss the traditional Royal force and recruit a force of Stormlanders, that would be like Targaryens dismissing the Kingslanders and getting people from Dragonstone to KL to serve them which would hurt the balance of power in different regions of Westeros. If Robert is to be seen as the King, he has to act like a King. Which means, holding on to Crownlands for his power and never showing particular favor to one Kingdom, even if it is his own origin. </p>

<p>The Lannister guards aren't official part of the Crown's swords. They are rather the Queen's swords. </p>

<h3>Where was Baratheon Army when they declared for Stannis?</h3>

<p>It wasn't Baratheon Army per se. It was rather Stormlander Army, sworn to House Baratheon of Storm's End and its lord Renly Baratheon.</p>

<p>The Baratheon Army was on outskirts of Storm's End then. Stannis had surprised Renly by laying siege to Storm's End instead of King's Landing. Renly rode with his Army, made of Tyrells and Baratheon sworn Lords to defeat Stannis. Stannis however had Renly killed by sorcery. The Tyrells fled as they had no reason to fight for Stannis, unlike Renly who was married to Margaery. </p>

<p>The Stormlords however had no choice but to declare for Stannis. Where were they to go except to the last Baratheon? That's how Stannis got the command of Stormlander aka Baratheon army. </p>

<h3>How Much say do soldiers get?</h3>

<p>None. Soldiers don't choose who they fight for. They fight for their own local Landed Knights, Lords and Lords Paramount. They are normally peasants who answer the call when their liege calls for them and follow him into the battle. It is the lords who choose who will they fight for. </p>

<p>The administrative ranking is:</p>

<ol>
<li>King</li>
<li>Lord Paramount</li>
<li>Major Lord</li>
<li>Minor Lord</li>
<li>Landed Knight</li>
<li>Peasant</li>

<p>Landed Knights can call their peasants to arms either by themselves or by command of their liege minor lords. Minor lords can also do that except that their commands come from their liege major lords. Same is true of Major lords except that their commands come from their liege Lords Paramount. Lords Paramount answer to no one except the King. </p>

<p>So the Baratheon soldiers didn't quiet have a choice between the three. The Baratheon men in Dragonstone followed Stannis, Baratheon men in Storm's End followed Renly.</p>

"143213","Is George RR Martin's character Tyrion connected or inspired from Kurt Vonnegut's character Newton Hoenikker?","<p>Just started reading <em>Cat's Cradle</em> by Kurt Vonnegut and found it interesting that Newton, the youngest of 3 children, of ""one of the so-called 'fathers' of the first atomic bomb"", Dr. Felix Hoenikker, was a ""midget"" whose mother died when he was born. </p>

<p>Any possibility that Mr. Martin was connecting these or just a coincidence? </p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><inspiration>","143251","<p>No that is just a coincidence.</p>
<p>GRRM sort of created the character in 1981 while he was collaborating with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Tuttle"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lisa Tuttle</a> on a trio of novellas that would be published as the novel <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windhaven"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Windhaven</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well… In 1981 I wrote a novel with Lisa Tuttle called Windhaven. In fact, we wrote three different short stories with the same main character, Maris, and once we had them written we decided to put them all into one book with three different parts. So while we were writing the books we thought about a dwarf who would have been the Lord of one of the islands. He had to be the ugliest person in the world but the most intelligent too. I kept that idea in my mind and it reappeared to me when I was starting to write Game of Thrones. <strong>So…That’s Tyrion Lannister</strong>.</p>

<p>So as you can see, Cat's Cradle isn't an inspiration for Tyrion because otherwise George would have said so.</p>

"4776","What is a ""year"" in Westeros?","<p>I only watched the Game of Thrones TV series. But there it was said that the current summer lasted for already nine years. In our world a ""year"" is the time in which all four seasons pass. Since this is different in Westeros, they seem to have some other way of saying what a ""year"" is. Is this somehow explained in the books?</p>

<p>From <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Westeros"" rel=""noreferrer"">""Westeros""</a>, <em>A Wiki of Ice and Fire</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Westeros is at the mercy of erratic seasons that may last for many
  years, but whose duration is unpredictable. At the beginning of A Song
  of Ice and Fire the continent has enjoyed a decade-long summer, and
  many fear that an equally long and harsh winter will follow. It is
  unclear to which degree the eastern continent is subject to the same
  conditions. George R. R. Martin explicitly and more than once stated
  that the explanation of the Planet's climate will be revealed at the
  end of the series, so he cannot disclose any further details on the
  issue before that point. He also stated that the explanation will be
  magical in nature and will not involve any sci-fi elements.</p>

"209637","Are there other sources of air in the crypt of Winterfell?","<p>When fire burns it removes oxygen and gives out carbon dioxide (among other gases) this means that if a fire burns in a confined space it quickly becomes fatal to humans to be in the space even if the fire is under control. The fact that torches are always seen to be burning in the crypt suggests that either the door is always open and provides enough fresh air to keep the torches burning without causing a risk to health, or there are other forms of ventilation such as vents to the surface etc.</p>

<p>Has it been shown in the TV series, in the books, or the various source books (e.g. any plans of Winterfell) that there is additional ventilation in the crypt? If the refugees lock themselves in the crypt what will stop them from suffocating?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","209647","<p>There are none mentioned that I know of. All we hear of is the main door into the crypts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The door to the crypts was made of ironwood. It was old and heavy, and lay at a slant to the ground. Only one person could approach it at a time. Osha tried once more when she reached it, but Bran could see that it was not budging. &quot;Let Hodor try.&quot;</p>
<p><sub><em>A Clash of Kings</em>, Bran VII</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's worth noting that Winterfell has hollow walls, or at least piped walls, where hot spring water runs through and so if the engineers (Brandon the Builder) thought about that they probably thought about ventilation in the crypts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of all the rooms in Winterfell's Great Keep, Catelyn's bedchambers were the hottest. She seldom had to light a fire. <strong>The castle had been built over natural hot springs, and the scalding waters rushed through its walls and chambers like blood through a man's body</strong>, driving the chill from the stone halls, filling the glass gardens with a moist warmth, keeping the earth from freezing. Open pools smoked day and night in a dozen small courtyards. That was a little thing, in summer; in winter, it was the difference between life and death.</p>
<p><sub><em>A Game of Thrones</em>, Catelyn II</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We also know that Bran and co managed to survive in the crypts when Theon took it and so there must be some sort of ventilation down there otherwise that would not have been possible. Of course we're talking about different volumes here but the principle is the same.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The legs, I could tell... the clothes fit, but the muscles in his legs... poor lad...&quot; He coughed, and blood came up from inside him. &quot;You vanished... in the woods... how, though?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We never went,&quot; said Bran. &quot;Well, only to the edge, and then doubled back. I sent the wolves on to make a trail, but we hid in Father's tomb.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The crypts.&quot; Luwin chuckled, a froth of blood on his lips. When the maester tried to move, he gave a sharp gasp of pain.</p>
<p><sub><em>A Clash of Kings</em>, Bran VII</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lastly, we know of an underground town, Mole's Town, and I don't think there's mention of ventilation down there except for the main entrance. Again, considering people live down there, it is safe to assume there is some form of ventilation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mole's Town was bigger than it seemed, but three quarters of it was under the ground, in deep warm cellars connected by a maze of tunnels. Even the whorehouse was down there, nothing on the surface but a wooden shack no bigger than a privy, with a red lantern hung over the door. On the Wall, he'd heard men call the whores &quot;buried treasures.&quot; He wondered whether any of his brothers in black were down there tonight, mining. That was oathbreaking too, yet no one seemed to care.</p>

<p>Personally I think this would have been a great opportunity for Martin to throw in a twist to the readers, but I just don't know how he'd do it now. What I thought when I read it originally was that the mother made her daughter abort her baby, no. I thought that wasn't her daughter, Jaime has probably never met Jeyne before and no one (of importance to the situation) would be the wiser. </p>

<p>When they changed the character Jeyne Westerling to Talisa Maegry in the show, then killed her off I was wondering what would happen in the books. I know that they are two different things but they can't have something major like Jeyne actually being pregnant happen in the books but not the show.</p>

<p>Is this character someone whom we already know? If not, is he the same guy who later leads Samwell Tarly to meet Archmaester Marwyn?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","70940","<p>The man who appears in the prologue of AffC is in a lot of ways unknown. However, there are a few things to be noted, before we make any conclusions or assumptions.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Pate_(Novice)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pate</a> (the monk in your question) is killed by this man (from now, I will call him Killer). Pate is the viewpoint character and while his death is not explicitly confirmed (he might have just fainted from his wounds), the viewpoint character of all other book prologues has died, so we can assume that Pate did too.</li>
<li>Later, Samwell Tarly meets Pate, who is supposed to be dead. From this we can infer that Killer has killed Pate in order to assume his identity for some unknown purpose.</li>
<li>Pate describes Killer incredibly similarly to the way Arya describes <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jaqen_H%27ghar"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Jaqen H'ghar</a> when he changes his face in Storm of Swords.</li>
</ol>
<p>From 1 we can gather that Killer is a killer, obviously a rather cunning one, and that he does not really belong in Oldtown, as he is a stranger and an outsider. From 2, we can infer that Killer is most likely a <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Faceless_Men"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Faceless Man</a>, as he was able to assume Pate's identity. From 3, we can gather that Killer may be <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jaqen_H%27ghar"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Jaqen H'ghar</a>, who has gone to Oldtown for reasons which remain unknown.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>While the true identity of Killer is not known or explicitly told, it can be assumed with some degree of certainty that he is a Faceless Man, perhaps Jaqen H'qhar, whose reason to be in Oldtown is important enough to kill a man and assume his identity (simply being a guest at Oldtown is not enough, he must infiltrate the Citadel).</p>
<p>This character is, however, not the person who leads Sam to Marwyn, although he is present (in the guise of Pate) while this is going on. The person who leads Sam to Archmaester Marwyn is Novice Alleras, who is widely believed, though not confirmed, to be <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Sarella_Sand"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sarella Sand</a> (a bastard daughter of Oberyn Martell) in disguise.</p>
<h3>References</h3>

<p>I know the theory they are all Bran jumping through time, but is there a reason why the name keeps reappearing? Does every generation of ruling Stark name a son Brandon? The Starks go back 8,000 years so plenty of time to think of new names. </p>

"143520","Has George RR Martin admitted Historical Influences?","<p>There are many similarities between <em>A Song Of Ice And Fire</em> and real historical events I couldn't help but notice. Mainly:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The War of the Roses. This one is way too complicated for me to explain it. Here's a video explaining it: <div class=""youtube-embed""><div>
                <iframe width=""640px"" height=""395px"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/VjO55pKuBo4?start=0""></iframe>
            </div></div></p></li>
<li><p>Byzantium and most notably the Sieges of Constantinople. Constantinople was sieged numerous times, with only 2 of them ending with the opposite side winning. That was because of the excellent defence the city had. The two defence tactics that caught my attention were: </p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li><p>The Chain that was raised whenever enemy ships arrived, closing The Golden Horn, the primary  water inlet to the city.</p></li>
  <li><p>The Greek Fire, an incredibly flammable fire, as it would continue burning while floating on water.</p></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>These are way too similar to the tactics used by Tyrion in The Battle of the Blackwater in <em>Clash of Kings</em> (though the chain part doesn't appear in the show).</p></li>

","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><inspiration>","143522","<p>George R.R. Martin has explained his historical influences in a rather long correspondence with a fan. </p>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Historical_Influences/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Citadel SSM Entry ""Historical Influences""</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Firstly I'd like to apologize for wasting your time, reading this email; and I often think that you must be St. Job reborn... Where
  do you find the patience to read and answer to all your fans?</em></p>
  
  <p><strong>George:</strong> Patience is not the problem. There's just too few hours in the day.
  Try as I might, I do find myself falling further and further behind. I
  still have letters in my box from 1998. Sigh. But I plug away when I
  can...</p>
  
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>[Edited for clarity after this point. Ser Loras's (Ser Loras is the nickname of the fan) question concerning whether GRRM borrows from history, particularly Spanish
  history, received the reply below.]</em></p>
  
  <p><strong>George:</strong> Well, yes and no. I have drawn on a great many influences for these
  books. <strong>I do use incidents from history, yes, although I try not to do</strong>
  a <strong>straight one-for-one transposition of fact into fiction</strong>. I prefer to
  mix and match, and to add in some imaginative elements as well.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Most of my borrowings, however, come from English and French medieval</strong>
  <strong>history</strong>, simply because I am more familiar with those than with the heroes, legends, and traditions of other countries. <strong>The Wars of the</strong>
  <strong>Roses, the Crusades, and the Hundred Years War have been my biggest</strong>
  <strong>influences... oh, and some Scottish history as well, such as the</strong>
  <strong>infamous Black Dinner that inspired my own Red Wedding.</strong> This isn't a
  matter of choice so much as it is one of necessity. I don't have any
  other language besides English, and there's a paucity of good popular
  English language histories about medieval Spain, medieval Germany, and
  the like. I was in Germany last fall, and looked everywhere for good
  reference books about the medieval Holy Roman Empire, which would be
  treasure trove, I suspect. There are a ton of them that looked
  likely... but all in German.</p>
  
  <p>And in about a week I will be travelling to Spain, coincidentally
  enough, where I plan to search for some good popular histories as
  well. Whether I will find any I can read, however... well, it's
  doubtful.</p>
  
  <p>As to your specific question, I have seen the film version of EL CID,
  of course, and the Osprey book about the Reconquest is on my sheld.
  Good, but not nearly detailed enough.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Also, the fight between the Baratheon brothers for the throne is similar to the one held by the Trastamaras: Pedro el Cruel (Peter
  the Cruel), King of Castile and León and his brother Enrique (Henry).
  Again, am I close?</em></p>
  
  <p><strong>George:</strong> I know a little more about that one since it impinged on the Hundred
  Years War, and there are plenty of references for that in English. As
  a matter of fact, I collect miniature lead and pewter knights in 54mm
  scale, and I have figures of both Pedro the Cruel and Enrique the
  Bastard in my collection.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>More... I see a lot of Henry IV of Castile in Robert Baratheon, if I am right, you will now what I mean...</em></p>
  
  <p><strong>George:</strong> Sorry, Henry IV is not a fellow I know much about. <strong>If Robert is</strong>
  <strong>modelled on anyone, it is more Edward IV of England</strong>... though as
  usual, I rang in some changes.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Also, could Don Beltrán de la Cueva be similar to Ser Loras Tyrell. I mean, their histories do not fit perfectly but Don Beltrán
  (First Duke of Alburquerque) was reputed to be the best knight of
  Castile by then, and his sexuality raised many questions.</em></p>
  
  <p><strong>George:</strong> Again, don't know him. Wish I did. If I could find a good book...</p>
  
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>and lastly, there could be a parallelism between Aegon the Conqueror, and the spanish ""conquistadores"". Let me explain: Hernán
  Cortés for example, with less than a hundred men conquered the Aztec
  Empire... (Dragons=gunpowder?)</em></p>
  
  <p><strong>George:</strong> I know about Cortez, but <strong>Aegon the Conquerer derives more from William</strong>
  <strong>the Conquerer.</strong></p>
  
  <p>I would love to become more familiar with Spanish history. Can you
  recommend any good English language popular histories? I stress
  ""popular."" I am not looking for academic tomes about changing patterns
  of land use, but anecdotal history rich in details of battles,
  betrayals, love affairs, murders, and similar juicy stuff.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> <em>Thank you very much for your time, and I await with illusion for a reply.</em></p>
  
  <p><strong>George:</strong> I hope you didn't wait too long. Here 'tis.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, some of it will be revealed later so I won't talk about that
  aspect of it, but certainly the Wall comes from Hadrian's Wall, which
  I saw while visiting Scotland. I stood on Hadrian's Wall and tried to
  imagine what it would be like to be a Roman soldier sent here from
  Italy or Antioch. To stand here, to gaze off into the distance, not

<p>What does Jaime mean by 'knowing the game they are playing'? Does he mean the game of two enemies making some sort of deal that's advantageous to both sides (Bolton's motivations being exactly what he says they are later in the same conversation), or does he realise that</p>

  <p> Bolton has sold out to the Lannisters (i.e. to Lord Tywin) and is planning to betray Robb Stark</p>

<p>? We've been led to believe, by Jaime's own PoV scenes and by Brienne, that Jaime wasn't a part of what I mentioned in the last spoiler-tag, but does this scene suggest that actually he <em>did</em> know about it before the Red Wedding?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><character-motivation>","71060","<p>At this point Jaime has no reason to believe that Bolton has sold out the Starks. He's been locked up in the Riverrun dungeons for most of the war, with very little information being fed to him.

  <p>""Perhaps I ought to make a wedding gift of you to Edmure Tully . . . or strike your head off, as your sister did for Eddard Stark""</p>

<p>Here Bolton states what he <em>should</em> do as a Stark vassal. The fact that he hasn't done any of this, and presents it in the form of a suggestion, means that Bolton is hoping to hear any alternatives that Jaime has to offer.</p>

"210974","Why don't other Westeros houses use wildfire?","<p>In <em>Game of Thrones</em>, the use of wildfire during the battle of Blackwater seems like an obvious (technically <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/129613/20853"">magical</a>) advantage to have in a battle.</p>

<p>With news of the battle spreading, surely other houses would want that kind of power for themselves? Is lack of usage of wildfire due to some prohibition in the Faith of The Seven?</p>

<p>I haven't read the books, but maybe this is different compared to the TV show.</p>

<p>It doesn't seem realistic that the Alchemist Guild is able to keep the secret to the creation of wildfire.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","210977","<p><strong>TL;DR - Wildfire is difficult to produce and very volatile.</strong></p>

<p>Wildfire is created by Alchemists Guild which is a secret they posses alone. Their order is no longer prevalent in Westeros and the remaining members seem to be in King's Landing alone. This is the first reason why other houses do not use it.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The substance was the pyromancers' own term for wildfire. They called each other wisdom as well, which Tyrion found almost as annoying as their custom of hinting at the vast secret stores of knowledge that they wanted him to think they possessed. Once theirs had been a powerful guild, but in recent centuries the maesters of the Citadel had supplanted the alchemists almost everywhere. <strong>Now only a few of the older order remained</strong>, and they no longer even pretended to transmute metals...</p>
  
  <p>...but they could make wildfire.</p>
  
  <p><sub><em>A Clash of Kings - Tyrion V</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Guild created the Wildfire under the direction of the Targaryen's namely ""The Mad King"" Aerys II (<a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Wildfire_plot"" rel=""noreferrer"">see the Wildfire Plot</a>) which was then hidden underneath the city. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""There is a vault below this one where we store the older pots. Those from King Aerys's day. It was his fancy to have the jars made in the shapes of fruits. <strong>Very perilous fruits indeed</strong>, my lord Hand, and, hmmm, riper now than ever, if you take my meaning. We have sealed them with wax and pumped the lower vault full of water, but even so . . . by rights they ought to have been destroyed, <strong>but so many of our masters were murdered during the Sack of King's Landing, the few acolytes who remained were unequal to the task.</strong> And much of the stock we made for Aerys was lost. Only last year, two hundred jars were discovered in a storeroom beneath the Great Sept of Baelor. No one could recall how they came there, but I'm sure I do not need to tell you that the High Septon was beside himself with terror. I myself saw that they were safely moved. I had a cart filled with sand, and sent our most able acolytes. </p>
  
  <p><sub><em>A Clash of Kings - Tyrion V</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That secret involves spells that only the Alchemist's know and even for them it is difficult:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""We were, my lord Hand, my brothers and I have been laboring day and night from the first, I assure you. It is only, hmmm, we have made so much of the substance that we have become, hmmm, more practiced as it were, and also""—the alchemist shifted uncomfortably—<strong>""certain spells, hmmm, ancient secrets of our order, very delicate, very troublesome, but necessary if the substance is to be, hmmm, all it should be...""</strong></p>
  
  <p><sub><em>A Clash of Kings - Tyrion XI</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cersei initially found these stores and then Tyrion recruited the Guild to make more for Battle of Blackwater. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The pyromancers kept their recipe for wildfire a closely guarded secret, but Tyrion knew that it was a lengthy, dangerous, and time-consuming process.</strong> He had assumed the promise of ten thousand jars was a wild boast, like that of the bannerman who vows to marshal ten thousand swords for his lord and shows up on the day of battle with a hundred and two. If they can truly give us ten thousand . . .
  He did not know whether he ought to be delighted or terrified. Perhaps a smidge of both. ""I trust that your guild brothers are not engaging in any unseemly haste, Wisdom. We do not want ten thousand jars of defective wildfire, nor even one . . . and we most certainly do not want any mishaps.""</p>
  
  <p><sub><em>A Clash of Kings - Tyrion V</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second reason other houses do not use it is (as seen in the above quotes) a, Wildfire is time consuming and dangerous to make and has a shelf life. Once you have some, it may not work as you intend it to either, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An arrow could be aimed, and a spear, even the stone from a catapult, but wildfire had a will of its own. Once loosed, it was beyond the control of mere men. </p>
  
  <p><sub><em>A Clash of Kings - Tyrion XIII</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jaime also agrees with that assessment</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jaime ignored that. ""If these flames spread beyond the tower, you may end up burning down the castle whether you mean to or not. Wildfire is treacherous.""</p>
  
  <p><em><sub>A Feast for Crows - Cersei III</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if a another house wanted it use it, they would first have to hire the Alchemists Guild, which I'm sure during the Targaryen and Lannister reign would not have been taken kindly to. Next the would have to wait quite a long time for large enough store to be effectively used in battle to be made. Finally, they would have to hope and pray they stored and handled it properly without killing themselves. </p>

<p>Wildfire was Tyrion's last ditch effort to protect the city.</p>

"143646","How are the white Ravens Trained?","<p>At the turn of every season the Maesters of the Citadel send a white Raven to every Castle and Hold-fast in Westeros. This is how the people of Westeros know that it is officially a new season. However, I wish to know how the white Ravens are trained.</p>

<p>I say trained because, in the books a Maester, I believe it is Maester Kressen, mentions that most Ravens only fly to and from their home castle and one other castle. However, the Maester does mention that the more intelligent among their species can be trained to fly to more than one Castle. I tend to believe this means that the black ravens must be trained to become messengers, though I may be wrong.</p>

<p>So my question is, how do the Maesters train the white ravens without having a false alarm every time they make a practice journey?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","144021","<h3>Lack of Explicit info</h3>
<p>The answer is: <em>We do not know</em>.</p>
<p>There is no mention in the books about the training procedure for the ravens whether they be black or white.</p>
<p>So the following would be just speculation based on logic and canon evidence.</p>
<h3>Attaching a note to the bird</h3>
<p>Maesters can attach notes to the white birds to notify the recipients that it is a drill and not a herald of Winter's arrival.</p>
<p>In Westeros, Seasons are more fickle than sellswords or Ironborn.  For instance, see the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/281_AC"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">year of false Spring</a> when everyone thought that Winter was over when in fact it wasn't. So odd timing of arrival of a white raven alone won't lead to the conclusion that this may have been just a drill.</p>
<p>Which means that the maesters would have to explicitly communicate to the lord concerned that his castle may host a trainee bird. This can be done by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attaching a note to the White bird with explanation.</li>
<li>Notifying the lord via a black raven prior to the flight of the white raven so that the hosts are prepared to see the winter bird.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Meetings of Lords</h3>
<p>When winter is actually on the horizon, regional lords hold a summit with their overlords to decide what portion of the harvest is to be set aside as reserve for winter.</p>
<p>For example, in <em>ACOK</em>, we see Northern Lords or their representatives arriving in Winterfell for a Harvest feast where they asked the Starks about food provisions for the upcoming winter.</p>
<p>From <em>ACOK, Bran II</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bran soon realized that it was the steward, not Lady Glover, who truly
ruled at Deepwood Motte. <strong>The man allowed that he was at present
setting aside only a tenth of his harvest</strong>. A hedge wizard had told
him there would be a bountiful spirit summer before the cold set in,
he claimed. Maester Luwin had a number of choice things to say about
hedge wizards. <strong>Ser Rodrik commanded the man to set aside a fifth</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the same chapter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the morrow came, most of the morning was given over to talk of
grains and greens and salting meat. Once the maesters in their Citadel
had proclaimed the first of autumn, wise men put away a portion of
each harvest... though how large a portion was a matter that seemed to
require much talk. <strong>Lady Hornwood was storing a fifth of her harvest.
At Maester Luwin’s suggestion, she vowed to increase that to a
quarter.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So let's say even if a Lord was mistaken in actually believing that Winter was indeed coming for any reason, he would then send a delegation or a message to his overlord about the portion of harvest to be stored which would then confirm that Winter isn't actually coming.</p>
<h3>Local Maester</h3>
<p>Local Maesters themselves appear to keep record of seasons in addition to the records kept by the central Citadel in Old Town. For example, Maester Aemon kept his own readings of seasons and did not solely rely on readings of the citadel.</p>
<p>From <em>AGOT, Tyrion III</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Lord Commander did not seem amused. “You are not fool enough to
believe that, my lord. Already the days grow shorter. There can be no
mistake, <strong>Aemon has had letters from the Citadel, findings in accord
with his own</strong>. The end of summer stares us in the face.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So in event of receiving such a bird, local Maester might be able to figure out that it is just a drill even if there was no notification of that.</p>

"143810","Why did Rhaegar take Lyanna to Dorne?","<p>Considering Rhaegar Targaryen was married to Elia Martell of Dorne, wasn't it rather stupid of him to take Lyanna Stark to the Tower of Joy, which is situated in the Red Mountains of Dorne? </p>

<p>Even considering the relatively free sexual norms in Dorne, and that Targaryens practiced polygamy, the Martell family might not have been too thrilled at Rhaegar treating Elia this way. As Oberyn states, it is a big insult to Elia's, and therefore the Martell family's honor. So not only would they have been angry at Lyanna's and Rhaegar's affair/marriage, wouldn't her presence in their land (or at their borders) not infuriate them even more?</p>

<p>I can think of a few explanations:</p>

<ol>
<li>Rhaegar's and Lyanna's affair was secret and the Martells did not know that Lyanna was in Dorne. </li>
<li>The Martells believed that Rhaegar was ""the Prince that was Promised"" (as he believed himself at some point) and that he needed to have three children (Aegon, Rhaenys and Visenya, named after Aegon the Conqueror and his sisters), while Elia had given birth to two children before being rendered too weak, or possibly infertile, to have a third. In this case the Martells might have agreed with the alleged kidnapping/elopement. But in place of a little Visenya, Lyanna of course gave birth to Jon Targaryen-Snow.</li>
<li>This might have been a truly stupid decision on Rhaegar's part and GRRM will explain this later in the story.</li>
</ol>

<p>Which of these is plausible (in-universe), or might there be a better explanation? What did I miss?</p>

<p>In case the TV series and the book series contradict each other, explanations from the book series are preferred!</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","145088","<h3>Canon Answer</h3>
<p>The canon answer is: <em>We do not know yet</em>. There is not much data available about what went on in Tower of Joy and Rhaegar's mind. All the people who might have known what happened there are dead except Howland Reed. And even Howland Reed can't be expected to know what was actually Rhaegar thinking. Only man who might have known it was Arthur Dayne, Rhaegar's friend. Arthur was killed at tower of joy along with other white swords posted there.</p>
<p>It is most plausibly going to be explained in the upcoming installments.</p>
<h3>Speculation</h3>
<p>There is no reason to assume that Prince Doran had any way of knowing that Rhaegar was in Dorne.</p>
<p>Even if he knew about it, It is not place of Prince Doran to tell Rhaegar what to do and what not to do. Rhaegar is a prince of the blood and heir to the throne of Aegon the conqueror. Example is Prince Aegon (Later King Aegon V). Lords positively hated him but none dared to tell the Prince to leave their lands. However the counter example here is that Lady Jeyne Arryn of Vale expelled Prince Daemon Targaryen from Vale and forbid his entry into her domains ever again. However the difference here is, Daemon was younger brother of the King with no chance of inheriting the throne and no lands of his own so it was easier to offend him. Rhaegar was however the crown prince and Prince of Dragonstone, a power in his own right.</p>
<p>Also, the War did not start immediately after the kidnapping. There was this whole period where Brandon went to KL, King summoned Lord Rickard, Lord Rickard came to KL from Winterfell, Both were executed. King then sent orders to Lord Arryn to kill his wards. That started the war. So there must have been months in the prelude in which it wasnt clear if there was going to be a war so why should the cautious Prince Doran take the risk of offending the crown prince?</p>
<p>Prince Doran was however not pleased with the news he had received about the Stark girl and Rhaegar. When Aerys called his banners against the Rebels, Prince Doran was deliberately slow in response. He did not, if he knew Rhaegar was in Dorne, give command of Dornish Armies to the Prince. He only sent the Dornish Armies forward once the Crown Prince had left Dorne. There was this whole embassy under the Prince's uncle and King's guard Lewyn Martell too so it is plausible that it was Prince Lewyn who persuaded Doran to send his Armies forward.</p>
<p>In any case:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is no indication that Prince Doran knew about the prophecy of The Prince that was promised.</li>
<li>There is no indication that Prince Doran was aware of Rhaegar's presence in the Red Mountains. Even the King didn't know about his son's whereabouts.</li>
<li>Prince Doran obviously felt insult by events of Tourney of Harrenhal which resulted in passive-aggressive act of defiance e.g. not giving Rhaegar the command of his armies and being slow in his reaction when commanded by the King to send forth the Armies of Dorne.</li>

<p>So while George R.R. Martin seems to imply that it doesn't make a different (Or at least doesn't say that it makes a difference), he also refused to comment on Jon's case. So I believe we can say that George is pretty much vague on the subject.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Speculation</h3>
<p>While there aren't many direct examples of similar cases from the Night's Watch, we do have two If-ish examples from the Order of the Maesters, who swear similar vows of renouncing all claims to land, title, wealth and are sworn to serve rather than lead. Do note, none of these people:</p>
<ol>
<li>Took the vows while simultaneously being heirs to something.</li>
<li>The only way they became heirs eventually was all about luck.</li>
</ol>
<p>First (weaker) example would be Prince Vaegon, third son of King Jaehaerys I. Since Jaehaerys had the proverbial heir and a spare in his eldest sons Aemon and Baelon, and Jaehaerys sent him off to the Citadel after the Prince showed a singular lack of interest in administration, women and martial arts (His only interest was books). Given his exceptionally bright mind, Vaegon eventually rose to rod and mask of an Archmaester. Vaegon never suspected that the crown might come to him. But as it happened, Prince Aemon died in a war. Jaehaerys passed over Aemon's daughter Rhaenys and made his second son Baelon the Prince of Dragonstone. Baelon already had two strong sons so succession seemed secured. That did not come to pass, Baelon passed away of medical causes. Had Baelon ascended the Iron Throne, his son Viserys would have been the undisputed heir. There the histories diverge. Some argue that Jaehaerys had asked Vaegon to leave the Citadel and take up his position as Prince of Dragonstone since his Grace had already established the precedent of passing-over grand-children in favour of his children. Others argue that he had merely sent for him to ask for his counsel. In any case Vaegon came. If the former narrative is correct, Vaegon refused the crown because of his vows. He did however advise his father to call a grand council of the realm to elect the heir from all claimants (Primarily the Old King's grandchildren), which Jaehaerys eagerly seized upon. So if we assume that Vaegon was offered the crown, he didn't think he could be released from his vows just because it turned out he was now the heir by proximity.</p>
<p>Second and stronger example would be Maester Aemon. His father Maekar was fourth son of King Daeron II. Since Daeron had his heirs in his eldest Son Baelor (And his sons Valarr and Matarys), he sent off Aemon (Third son of a fourth son) to the Citadel, famously commenting &quot;Too many dragons are just as dangerous as too few&quot;. Nobody thought that a third son of a fourth son might become heir someday. But as it happened:</p>
<ol>
<li>Baelor died in a tourney accident.</li>
<li>Valarr and Matarys died in the Spring sickness along with Daeron II.</li>
</ol>
<p>Daeron's second son Aerys I took the throne and died childless. Daeron's third son Rhaegel had predeceased Aerys (Along with Rhaegel's own twins Aelor and Aelora). So as a result his youngest brother Maekar, the fourth son took the throne. Maekar had his own heirs in his eldest two sons Daeron and Aerion. Yet again, the two eldest Princes predeceased their father. And then Maekar died unexpectedly in a battle against Rebels. Once again, The succession was thrown in confusion due to multitude of claimants. Another Grand-council was convened. Daeron's daughter was passed over because of her sex and mental incapability. Aerion's son was passed over because of his infancy and fears of him inheriting his father's insanity. That left only Maekar's youngest son Aegon but the Lords refused to have that half-peasant (He grew up living among the smallfolk as squire of a hedge knight) as their King. The Lords offered the throne to Maekar's third son Aemon first, quietly. High Septon himself offered to free Aemon of his vows as a maester. Aemon refused and took the Black instead so that he couldn't be used by dissident Lords against his brother Aegon. In Aemon's case however, it does appear that everyone believed he could be released from his vows given the new developments and him emerging as the popular heir. Aemon himself seems to think otherwise and he took the Black apparently to shut that door forever. So perhaps Night's Watch's norms are more <em>final</em> in that sense than the Citadel's vows? Or maybe Aemon just wanted to put some distance between himself and nobility of the realm.</p>
<p>A third case (The only example from Night's Watch) would be that of Lord Commander Hoare. He was in command of the Wall while his elder brother King Harren 'The Black' ruled Isles and Rivers. Harren already had plenty of sons so succession seemed secure. And then Aegon the Dragon came and ended the Black line when Balerion burnt Harrenhal. The Lord Commander Hoare did not abandon his post because apparently as per the new developments, he became the heir to the driftwood crown. Nor did he abandon his post to avenge the destruction of his house even though he ten thousand swords sworn to him.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>There seems to be no clear cut answer for this.</p>
<ol>
<li>George may or may not have implied that new revelations do not have any impact on sworn vows.</li>
<li>There are no clear examples of people who joined orders of servitude while they were both heirs to something and were unaware of it. The only examples are in the cases where by unforeseen circumstances, they ended up becoming the heirs.</li>

<p>are the Night's Watch still required?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","211460","<p>Well no, but actually yes.</p>

<p>After Battle of the Dawn when the Others were defeated the first time, the Order retained its structure. They won but they didn't know if the threat was truly gone so they remained on their posts, defending the realms of Men against Night's King (The real one, not Darth Maul on Ice) and Wildlings. With time, they lost sense of their true purpose and many believed they were just meant to fight the Wildlings. </p>

<p>Now in the showverse, it seems <em>the Long Night</em> is over after stretching shockingly for almost one whole night. But that doesn't mean that the Watch has lost its usefulness. Here's why:</p>

<ol>
<li>Night's Watch provides a chance for redemption to criminals. For example <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Brynden_Rivers"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Brynden Rivers</a>, <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ulmer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ulmer of Kingswood</a>, <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Olyver_Bracken"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Olyver Bracken</a> etc. At th every least, it keeps dangerous criminals out of the society.</li>
<li>It provides a home to misfits like younger sons, bastards, orphans and starving who belong nowhere. For example <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Waymar_Royce"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Waymar Royce</a>, <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jon_Snow"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Jon Snow</a>, <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lommy_Greenhands"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lommy Greenhands</a>, <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Hot_Pie"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hotpie</a> etc.</li>
<li>It provides a way for the nobles to get rid of rival claimants in a way softer than execution and more permanent than exile. For example <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Yorick_V_Yronwood"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Yorick V Yronwood</a>, <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Eddard_Stark"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Eddard Stark</a> etc.</li>
<li>The hope of being allowed to take the black leads to swifter surrender of people with a losing cause. For example both <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon_II"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Aegon II</a> and <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Theon_Greyjoy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Theon Greyjoy</a> became very hopeful when their Maesters counselled them to join the Watch as their enemies approached. It's another story that both of them decided not to given that they didn't trust their enemies (Or in Theon's case, brothers on the Wall).</li>
<li>It provides a chance to the lowborn and bastards to rise high in the world. For example <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Cotter_Pyke"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cotter Pyke</a>, <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Satin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Satin</a> and <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jon_Snow"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Jon Snow</a>.</li>
<li>On the off-chance that the others might rise again, the Watch needs to be there to fight it again, wake the sleepers and defend the realms of men.</li>

"211457","What happens to the property of Westerosi Houses if they're wiped out?","<p>In <em>Game of Thrones</em>, we have now seen some of the Great Houses of the North and the Seven Kingdoms virtually wiped out. Is there a canon (TV show or books) answer to what happens to their lands etc? What would happen traditionally?</p>

<p>For example, would Houses</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Umber and Mormont</p>
</blockquote>

<p>come under Stark rule? What would become of House Tarly if Sam is still in the Night's Watch?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","211483","<p>We have seen that reassigning the lands of an extinct houses falls to both:</p>

<ol>
<li>The respective Lord Paramount. </li>
<li>The Crown</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, see House Hornwood. Lord Halys and his heir were slain fighting the Lannisters which meant an end of legitimate male line of that family. It fell to Winterfell to decide who will be the next Lord Hornwood. Candidates were nephew of Lord Hornwood by his sister (Whose father offered that he'll take Hornwood name if chosen the heir) Beren Tallhart and Larence Snow, Lord Hornwood's bastard. But of course it must be noted that Robb had declared himself King in the North at that point. So you could say ""the Crown"" decided the fate of the Hornwood lands. But did that duty fall to Robb simply because of his declaration? Or was it always his duty? We do not know.</p>

<p>We have plenty of examples where the Crown decided who gets the lands of extinct Houses. For example, take Harrenhal. The Crown periodically assigned it to new houses on extinction of the previous holders e.g. Harroways, Towers, Strongs, Lothstons etc. </p>

<p>Since the overwhelming pattern says the crown decides, Let's just assume that is true and the authority of the Lords Paramount doesn't extend to settling cases of extinct houses. Do bear in mind however, the case of Reynes. Lord Tywin wiped out that house when it rose in rebellion. King Aerys did not intervene. Later, King Robert and his hands did not seek to reassign the lands either. It was later when Tywin himself was hand to King Tommen that Castle Castamere was granted to House Spicer for their role in fall of the Young Wolf.</p>

<p>Now specifically for House Tarly, Lord Randyll Tarly's male line might be extinct (Given Dickon's death and Sam's vows) but he still had a number of daughters (Even if we dismiss the possibility of Randyll's brothers, uncles, cousins etc). Either one of them can inherit the Castle Hornhill in absence of a male claimant. If either one of them has a son, that boy can take the name of his grandfather and become the next Lord Tarly. Similarly, any man who marries any of the Tarly girls can take the name Tarly as well. <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/134306/54887"">See this answer for details</a></p>

<p>Though the Citadel has long sought to learn the manner by which it may predict the length and change of seasons, all efforts have been confounded. Septon Barth appeared to argue, in a fragmentary treatise, that <strong>the inconstancy of the seasons was a matter of magical art</strong> rather than trustworthy knowledge. Maester Nicol's The Measure of the Days—otherwise a laudable work containing much of use—seems influenced by this argument. Based upon his work on the movement of stars in the firmament, <strong>Nicol argues unconvincingly that the seasons might once have been of a regular length</strong>, determined solely by the way in which the globe faces the sun in its heavenly course. The notion behind it seems true enough—that the lengthening and shortening of days, if more regular, would have led to more regular seasons—but he could find <strong>no evidence that such was ever the case, beyond the most ancient of tales.</strong></p>

<li>Ned's situation is more interesting.  He is next in line if Brandon dies without producing an heir.

"144349","Ending a siege by single combat?","<p>I've seen at least two occurrences where the defending party is requesting a single combat to end a siege, and it looks like an actual way to end a siege :
Stannis and Cortnay at Storm's End.
Jaime and Brynden at Riverrun. </p>

<p>Is there a case where the attacking army accepts this duel? Does the besieging army simply go away if the besieged champion wins the fight?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","144353","<p>One also must remember that most armies are comprised of common folk who have been called by their liege lords, and tat be a long chain of lords until you reach a great house. The great houses are fighting for their own interests and not those of the common folk. Why should they continue the fight once the reason the fight was started is no longer an issue?</p>

<p>In a open field battle, even if the knights and direct retainers wanted to avenge their lord who lost the single combat they would most likely be out numbered as the common folk of the lord who won would still be there. For a castle being sieges it is much the same philosophy, except at that the common folk inside know it will only be a matter of time before they starve. Most would see the only option as opening the gate and praying the attackers are merciful.</p>

<p>For an in-universe perspective look to what happened when Renly was killed prior to meeting Stannis in battle. Renly is killed and his army divides and scatters. It is very demoralizing when your commanding officer is taken from the fight. The commanding officer is usually the best tactician as well, so an army missing their leader will quickly lose ranks and order. I will admit Renly's case is a bit different because his army was <em>supposed</em> to have sworn fealty to Stannis from the start.

The ""Mystery Knight"" is a tougher nut to crack. Both Reed and Lyanna Stark have been put up as possible candidates. Both are small in stature, and both had a lot to prove. Personally, I'm leaning towards the Mystery Knight being Lyanna, who has a stronger case of needing to hide her identity in the lists. We also know (from flashbacks) that she was probably martially trained to some extent. OTOH Reed is a Crannogman, who are not exactly known for their equestrian skills.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Jon Snow's hand is badly burned when he fights the wight to save commander Mormont.
Dany is near invincible to fire. And she says of Viserys ""He was no dragon"" when he dies of the burning golden crown. Assuming that fire immunity passes from parents, how to explain the fact that Jon gets burned? (Come to think of it, The burned hand is reminded persistently after that)</p></li>
<li><p>Jon Snow is a warg.
It is never mentioned that Ned Stark is a warg. But seems like all his (real?) children are. Is it a coincidence that Jon is a warg? Can this ability pass from mother's side to a child? </p></li>
</ol>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><jon-snow>","72014","<p>The first contradiction is actually based on a misconception. <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/9356/is-daenerys-targaryen-immune-to-fire"">Targeryons are not immune to fire</a>, as showcased by Viserys and the Tragedy at Summerhall.</p>

<p>The second one is trickier, as the genetics of warging is never entirely explained. There are zero examples of a warg passing their abilities on to their child. But if R + L = J, the Starks and Jon are still cousins, making it well within the realm of possibility they'd inherit similar traits. After all, if Ned could recessively pass the trait down to at least three kids married to a Riverlander, why couldn't Lyanna with a Targaryen?</p>

<p>One thing that DOES seem to be common to all wargs is that they hold to the old gods and are raised in the North. So for all we know, someone with no bloodline from the North could end up with warging abilities based on some unknown Northern magic.</p>

<p>From there the skulls ranged upward in size to the three great monsters of song and story, the dragons that Aegon Targaryen and his sisters had unleashed on the Seven Kingdoms of old. The singers had given them the names of gods: Balerion, Meraxes, Vhaghar. Tyrion had stood between their gaping jaws, wordless and awed. You could have ridden a horse down Vhaghar's gullet, although you would not have ridden it out again. Meraxes was even bigger. And the greatest of them, Balerion, the Black Dread, could have swallowed an aurochs whole, or even one of the hairy mammoths said to roam the cold wastes beyond the Port of Ibben.</p>

<p>The Dothraki looked at her hatchlings uneasily. The largest of her three was shiny black, his scales slashed with streaks of vivid scarlet to match his wings and horns. &quot;Khaleesi,&quot; Aggo murmured, &quot;there sits Balerion, come again.&quot;</p>

"212048","Why is the Night's Watch so depleted at the start of ASOIAF?","<p>At the start of AGOT, the total number of the Night's Watch is said to be less than a thousand. During Aegon's conquest, the Watch numbered ten thousand men. Out of the nineteen castles on the wall, only three are manned today. Castle black itself is once said to have housed 5000. </p>

<p>This rapid deterioration doesn't make sense to me from a world-building perspective. The NW have continued to maintain themselves pretty well for nigh on 8000 years (if the tales can be believed that is, Sam Tarly finds no written evidence of Lord Commanders earlier than #673, which suggests that 8000 years may be an inflated 'legendary' number). </p>

<p>Whereas in the real world, one of the oldest and most venerable institutions, the Catholic Church, has been around for less than 2000 years and has been administered by ~200 popes. The Night's Watch has had a few rocky years, sure, but for it to maintain itself so well for so long and then deteriorate only in the last 300 years seems strange to me. </p>

<p>The NW has two purposes. The ostensible one of defending against the Others, and the (arguably much more real, at least at the start of AGOT) purpose of serving as a dumping ground for the 'losers' of Westeros. By 'losers', I mean the people on the losing side of various wars and political battles, as well as criminals and n-th sons of noble houses with nothing to inherit.</p>

<p>I am currently reading through Fire and Blood, and was struck by one chapter, where an armed revolt of members of the Faith were defeated by Maegor, and 2000 brothers were forced to take the black. Those sorts of numbers don't exist in the recent histories it seems. </p>

<p>One would expect that after Robert's Rebellion, there would be a surfeit of defeated Targaryen loyalists who were forced to take the black, but apart from a smattering of named characters (including Ser Alliser Thorne), there seem to be hardly any Night's watch recruits from recent wars.</p>

<p><strong>Given the way the Night's watch is continually bolstered by the losers of wars and by criminals and other people who elsewise have nothing going for them, why, at the start of AGOT, is the force so depleted?</strong>        </p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","213503","<p>So I've come up with an answer that I find sufficiently satisfying.</p>

<p><strong>Institutional decay doesn't just happen</strong></p>

<p>It's a common trope of fantasy that things 'just used to be better', which fits well with our intuition about real life. (An intuition, which as it happens, is often completely wrong). I think GRRM recognises and plays to this. The characters in the Age of Heroes (Bran the Builder, Symeon Star Eyes, Azor Ahai, etc.) are almost certainly nowhere near as epic as portrayed, if they ever existed at all.</p>

<p>In the absence of war and famine, societies typically flourish. If an institution is decaying, there <em>has to be a reason for it</em>. American manufacturing is in a decay because the Chinese can do the same for cheaper. Stamp collectors are a dying breed because no one uses the post for personal correspondence anymore, now that we have the internet. </p>

<p>So I reject the notion that the Night's watch are in a state of decay 'just because'.</p>

<p><strong>To maintain the culture of an institution, a steady (and relatively small) stream of new members is necessary</strong></p>

<p>New recruits to the night's watch do not initially share the values, nor understand the culture of the night's watch. By being in the minority, they can be forced to assimilate to the culture. Any new recruits who were previously members of a specific faction (they owe their allegiance to a specific lord or to the Seven) who might be inclined to bring their own value systems along can be quashed by the majority rest of the night's watch with little relative pushback.</p>

<p>However, when a cohort of new recruits becomes a significant minority or even a majority of members, that's when the institutional decay starts. The 'executive' of the night's watch - the commander, higher officers and all those responsible for management of the watch - no longer have the force of numbers to carry out arbitrary punishment. To punish a popular but harmful new recruit is to court violent reprisals.</p>

<p>There are many examples in the real world of close knit cultures being 'ruined' by too many new members. The first one that comes to mind is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September"" rel=""noreferrer"">september that never ended</a>, referring to the state of the nascent internet in 1993. Before then, usenet users were primarily academics, and each year (starting in september) a new cohort of users would arrive, and would typically be disruptive for a while before learning the etiquette of usenet. In September 1993, the launch of AOL meant that the influx was much greater than before, and the 'old guard' was powerless to teach the new users the ways of internet etiquette.</p>

<p>A similar effect can be seen within broader culture when the Baby boomers came of age. A lot of the previous culture (both the good and the bad) of the people who lived through WW2 was rejected by the Baby Boomers, and because of their sheer force of numbers, that culture shift persisted.</p>

<p><strong>So how did things change for the worse after the conquest?</strong></p>

<p>To quote Maester Aemon in AGOT (his ""Love is the death of Duty"" speech):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the days when the Seven Kingdoms were seven kingdoms, not a generation passed that three or four of them were not at war. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this is the key. With constant war comes a constant stream of defeated nobility heading towards the wall.</p>

<p>After Aegon's conquest, the dynamics change in two crucial ways: </p>

<ul>
<li>Wars are less frequent and much bigger</li>
<li>Peace can last for longer than a generation</li>
</ul>

<p>The end result of this is that the influx of quality recruits to the Night's Watch is very clumpy and unpredictable. Large numbers of new recruits will result in the decay of the culture and values in the ways that I explained above. When Maegor sent 2000 of the faith militant to the wall, that would have had a huge impact on the culture there, even though that 2000 would still have been in the minority at the time.</p>

<p><strong>Turnover on the wall is high</strong></p>

<p>The wall is not a good place for growing old.
There's not enough info in the books to make a reliable actuarial estimate on the mean lifetime of someone after taking the Black. It stands to reason though, that not many people would make it past 20 years of service.</p>

<p>During a time of long peace, the lack of quality recruits from defeated households could be disastrous. So the recruiters have to make up the shortfall with criminals, broken men and other such recruits who are unacquainted with discipline and following orders. I don't have any quotes with me to back this up, but I suspect the Night's Watch has always accepted and made use of criminals. However, these criminals can always be beaten into shape by the rest of the Night's watch.</p>

<p><em>The crucial change comes when the Night's Watch is forced, through a time of peace, to recruit primarily from criminals.</em></p>

<p>That changes the culture, and earns the Night's Watch an unsavoury reputation. As other have suggested, once the Night's watch is associated with criminals, this results in a positive feedback loop. Men of honour are less likely to see taking the Black as a noble pursuit, and Lords are more likely to see it as a fitting punishment for their criminals and prisoners. I think this goes a long way to answering why the Night's watch is depleted at the start of AGOT, but it doesn't completely answer it.</p>

<p><strong>The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond, and it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men</strong></p>

<p>Because of the high turnover at the wall, you don't necessarily need to look for longterm declining trends to explain the low population. Recent events are sufficient.</p>

<p>As @Aegon mentioned in his answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You're incorrect in assuming that Robert's Rebellion should have provided fresh manpower to Night's Watch. Robert pardoned every Targaryen loyalist. People lost parts of their lands but none lost their heads or titles. The only Targaryen loyalists we see on the Wall were sent there by Tywin Lannister, presumably after the sack of King's Landing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that pardoning these Targaryen loyalists deprived the Wall of much needed recruits, and was likely one of the biggest contributors to the lack of men serving there. The preceeding loss of respect for the Black probably influenced Robert's decision, but an arbitrary decision it still was.</p>

<p>Which is why the Night's watch is described as such by Maester Aemon. It's missing the cohort of middle-aged men whose combination of experience and fitness the Wall needed most. The cohort that would have been filled 15 years ago had Robert made a different decision.</p>

"212081","Is Martin subtly insulting the showrunners of Game of Thrones in Fire and Blood?","<p>One of the best moments in the book, hands down, is when Martin throws shade at Game of Thrones and the show runners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. Under the guise of the discussion of a book called ""A Caution for Young Girls"", Martin makes his opinion of certain decisions made in the adaptation process of his own books very clear. He begins by calling the book “distasteful,” a book found in brothels and catering to those of low morals. He then mentions that parts of the book “strain credulity” given how ridiculous the tales are, and increasingly so as the story continues.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We have no way to ascertain the veracity of her story, nor even whether she was in truth the author of this infamous book (some argue plausibly that the text is the product of several hands, for the style of the prose varies greatly from episode to episode).”<br>
  (<em>Fire and Blood</em>, p. 157)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean…good lord. The use of “episode to episode” makes the true object of his ridicule pretty clear. But he doesn’t stop there. Continuing with his mockery of the writers of the tales, he writes,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“[T]he scribes responsible were most likely septons expelled from the Faith for drunkenness, theft, or fornication, failed students who left the Citadel without a chain, hired quills from the Free Cities, or mummers (the worst of all). Lacking the rigor of maesters, such scribes oft feel free to “improve” on the texts they are copying. (Mummers in particular are prone to this.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the case of ""A Caution for Young Girls"", such “improvements” largely consisted of adding ever more episodes of depravity and changing the existing episodes to make them even more disturbing and lascivious. As alteration followed alteration over the years, it became ever more difficult to ascertain which was the original text, to the extent that even maesters at the Citadel cannot agree as to the title of the book, as has been noted.” (<em>Fire and Blood</em>, p.158-9)</p>

<p>I found it heccing weird because he stops in the middle to write a long description of this ultimately insignificant book. </p>

<p>At first, they were with Yoren's crew, heading to the Wall. They were attacked by Amory Lorch and escaped from their cage with an axe Arya gave them.</p>

<p>Were they captured by Amory Lorch or did they hide from the attackers ? Amory Lorch looked decided too kill evreybody of Yoren's crew.</p>

<p>Later, we see them with the Brave Companions. I don't think Amory would have sell them or given them to Vargo Hoat because Amory and Vargo disliked each other.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","144720","<p>They joined Amory Lorch after Arya saved them from the fire however it is not clear how they joined the Manticore's men.

<p>From Arya's POV in ACOK:</p>

  <p>Then she saw the three near the end of the column.</p>
  
  <p>Rorge had donned a black halfhelm with a broad iron nasal that made it

  before.</p>
  
  <p>But Jaqen H’ghar still smiled. His garb was still ragged and filthy,
  but he had found time to wash and brush his hair. It streamed down
  across his shoulders, red and white and shiny, and Arya heard the
  girls giggling to each other in admiration.</p>
  
  <p>I should have let the fire have them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later, Brave Companions brought some northern captives to Harrenhal. Arya forced Jaqen to help her free them. Jaqen brought them along. </p>

<p><em>The Weasel Soup</em> incident is:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> The Brave companions switched sides and joined the Starks. That
 resulted in occupation of Harrenhal by Roose Bolton and death of Amory

</blockquote>

<p>So They helped Jaqen and Arya in the Weasel Soup incident:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then she heard the ugly sound of Rorge’s voice. “Cook,” he shouted.
  “We’ll take your bloody broth.” Arya let go of the spoon in dismay. I
  never told him to bring them. Rorge wore his iron helmet, with the
  nasal that half hid his missing nose. Jaqen and Biter followed him
  into the kitchen.</p>
  
  <p>“The bloody broth isn’t bloody ready yet,” the cook said. “It needs to
  simmer. We only now put in the onions and-”</p>
  
  <p>“Shut your hole, or I’ll shove a spit up your ass and we’ll baste you
  for a turn or two. I said broth and I said now.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later, They apparently joined the Brave companions after the <em>Weasel Soup incident</em>. They told so to Ser Robbet Glover after the incident:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""This of the soup, that was clever,” the man Glover was saying. “I did
  not expect that. Was it Lord Hoat’s idea?”</p>
  
  <p>Rorge began to laugh. He laughed so hard that snot flew out the hole
  where his nose had been. Biter sat on top of one of the dead men,
  holding a limp hand as he gnawed at the fingers. Bones cracked between
  his teeth.</p>
  
  <p>“Who are you men?” A crease appeared between Robett Glover’s brows.
  “You were not with Hoat when he came to Lord Bolton’s encampment.
  <strong>Are you of the Brave Companions?</strong>”</p>
  
  <p><strong>Rorge wiped the snot off his chin with the back of his hand. “We are now.”</strong></p>
  
  <p>“This man has the honor to be Jaqen H’ghar, once of the Free City of
  Lorath. This man’s discourteous companions are named Rorge and Biter.
  A lord will know which is Biter.” He waved a hand toward Arya. “And
  here-”</p>
  
  <p>“I’m Weasel,” she blurted, before he could tell who she really was.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> the bells start to ring.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It also seems that she doesn't have any will to surrender.</p>

<p><strong>So who commanded that?</strong><br>
<strong>Or</strong> (if no one), <strong>who actually did it</strong> (maybe they decided by themselves to do it)?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","212366","<p>The first one to surrender (on screen) was the Lannister Captain that was facing down Jon, Grey Worm, a street full of Unsullied and Northmen, and a rather angry looking dragon on the tower.</p>

<p><div class=""youtube-embed""><div>
                <iframe width=""640px"" height=""395px"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/WroiPyBFays?start=217""></iframe>
            </div></div></p>

<p>Once someone with a position of authority set the precedent of surrender, the cry to ""ring the bells!"" spread through the army. We don't see who first uttered the cry, but we can safely assume it was the captain (or a lieutenant nearby) calling out to signal that the city surrendered. </p>

<p>Ringing the bells was apparently a culturally known sign, and since it was something a city's people would do, instead of something requiring the Lord/Lady/General to do (like a parley), it would seem it was somewhat common. This would make sense in a world where random towns would be used to various armies ""conquering"" them regularly. Like Tyrion said: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the realm? A vast continent, home to millions of people, most of whom don't care who sits on the Iron Throne.<br>
  <sub><em>Game of Thrones - S08E04: Last of the Starks</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The random citizens would rather pay taxes to the next Lord over, than die in defense of their current one. So once the army started surrendering, they raised the cry to ""ring the bells!"" and signal the surrender so that no one else had to die from the massive dragon who was actively burning down their city.</p>

<p>In short, and to answer the question directly, it was a general consensus based on cultural norm and prompted by the Lannister Captain who realized he was going to lose his battle.</p>
"
"212530","How well-known was Aerys Targaryen's madness outside the noble class?","<p>We all know Aerys II was mad, there's no disputing that. We often see the testimonies from the nobles however like Catelyn Stark:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Aerys . . .&quot; Catelyn could taste bile at the back of her throat. The story was so hideous she suspected it had to be true. &quot;<strong>Aerys was mad, the whole realm knew it</strong>, but if you would have me believe you slew him to avenge Brandon Stark . . .&quot; <br><sub><em>A Clash of Kings</em> - Catelyn VII</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or Brienne of Tarth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brienne was still awaiting his answer. Jaime said, &quot;You are not old enough to have known Aerys Targaryen . . .&quot;</p>
<p>She would not hear it. &quot;<strong>Aerys was mad and cruel, no one has ever denied that</strong>. He was still king, crowned and anointed. And you had sworn to protect him.&quot;<br><sub><em>A Storm of Swords</em> - Jaime II</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there's scarce information about how well were the people aware of their King's mental health. In fact we only see evidence to the contrary i.e. the Smallfolk loved their King like they loved his ancestors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Paid? He took two of my chickens and gave me a bit of paper with a mark on it. Can I eat a bit of raggy old paper, I ask you? Will it give me eggs?&quot; She looked about to see that no guards were near, and spat three times. &quot;There's for the Tullys and there's for the Lannisters and there's for the Starks.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's a sin and a shame,&quot; an old man hissed. &quot;<strong>When the old king was still alive, he'd not have stood for this</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>King Robert?</strong>&quot; Arya asked, forgetting herself.</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>King Aerys, gods grace him</strong>,&quot; the old man said, too loudly. A guard came sauntering over to shut them up. The old man lost both his teeth, and there was no more talk that night. <br><sub><em>A Clash of Kings</em> - Arya VI</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Cersei Lannister's memories of the Great Tourney of Casterly Rock:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She was ten when she finally saw her prince in the flesh, at the tourney her lord father had thrown to welcome King Aerys to the west. Viewing stands had been raised beneath the walls of Lannisport, and <strong>the cheers of the smallfolk had echoed off Casterly Rock like rolling thunder. They cheered Father twice as loudly as they cheered the king</strong>, the queen recalled, but only half as loudly as they cheered Prince Rhaegar.<br><sub><em>A Feast for Crows</em> - Cersei V</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Admittedly Aerys seems least popular when compared to Tywin or Rhaegar but people still cheered for their King.</p>
<p>Even the lower echelons of faith stood by the King if Prince Oberyn can be believed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;All that,&quot; said Prince Oberyn, &quot;and your father's fall as well. <strong>Lord Tywin had made himself greater than King Aerys, I heard one begging brother preach, but only a god is meant to stand above a king</strong>. You were his curse, a punishment sent by the gods to teach him that he was no better than any other man.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I try, but he refuses to learn.&quot; Tyrion gave a sigh. &quot;But do go on, I pray you. I love a good tale.&quot;<br><sub><em>A Storm of Swords</em> - Tyrion V</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that there's no mention of his madness or general unfitness to sit the throne, only that he was King by grace of gods and no one could ever stand higher than him.</p>
<p>Then we have what Nimble Dick Crabb, a commoner and an honest thief, told Brienne of Tarth how his people felt about Robert and Targaryens:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And what did Crackbones do when Aegon and his sisters came?&quot; Brienne asked him.</p>
<p>&quot;He was dead. M'lady must know that.&quot; Crabb gave her a sideways look. &quot;<strong>Aegon sent his sister up to Crackclaw, that Visenya</strong>. The lords had heard o' Harren's end. Being no fools, they laid their swords at her feet. <strong>The queen took them as her own men, and said they'd owe no fealty to Maidenpool, Crab Isle, or Duskendale</strong>. Don't stop them bloody Celtigars from sending men to t' eastern shore to collect his taxes. If he sends enough, a few come back to him . . . elsewise, <strong>we bow only to our own lords, and the king. The true king, not Robert and his ilk</strong>.&quot; He spat. &quot;There was Crabbs and Brunes and Boggses with Prince Rhaegar on the Trident, and in the Kingsguard too. A Hardy, a Cave, a Pyne, and three Crabbs, Clement and Rupert and Clarence the Short. Six foot tall, he was, but short compared to the real Ser Clarence. <strong>We're all good dragon men, up Crackclaw way.</strong>&quot;<br><sub><em>A Feast for Crows</em> - Brienne IV</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Nimble Dick isn't talking about Aerys specifically but given his age and context, he is clearly referring to either Aerys or Viserys as the true King and is proud of the fact that they are all Targaryen Loyalists where he comes from. But then again, we have Brienne's own words that she considered Aerys the true King personally, not Robert.</p>
<p>With rare direct testimonies concluded, if we try to judge perception of the people by the state of government, that also goes in Aerys' favour. For example:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Law &amp; Order</strong>: In <em>ASOS-Davos II</em>, Ser Davos recalls  that Sea-Watches used to be death for smugglers back when Aerys II sat the throne. (Davos himself was a commoner back then). We have already seen what the smallfolk think about banditry and cruelty of Lords in Aerys II's reign in Arya's POV quotation.</li>
<li><strong>Economy</strong>: In <em>AGOT-Eddard VI</em>, Ned exclaims aghast that Aerys II had left the treasury overflowing with gold.</li>
<li><strong>Public bouts of cruelty</strong>: In <em>AFFC-Brienne II</em>, a commoner in Duskendale tells Brienne that even though King Aerys II was very cruel in punishing the perpetrators of Defiance of Duskendale particularly Lord of Duskendale's wife, Half the folk in the City agreed that the King had been too kind to her compared to her crimes and how his Grace's royal person was violated and insulted in the defiance.</li>
<li><strong>Listening to the concerns of his people</strong>: In <em>AFFC-Jaime II</em>, the man who killed Aerys II recalls that when Arthur Dayne brought grievances of the folks of Kingswood to the King, Aerys not only listened but also resolved their troubles.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course we know all of that was because Tywin Lannister was governing the realm as Aerys' Hand but the commonfolk didn't really know that (Although there were rumours that the Hand ruled the King - Which surprisingly made the common folk hate Tywin rather than Aerys because once again, only gods may rule the King). Not to mention, the Mad King was clever enough to make sure that whenever anything went wrong, Tywin got the blame and whenever things went right, he got the credit. He even actively sabotaged Tywin's reputation to boost his own i.e. he randomly raised tarrifs and duties on ports in Tywin's name, only to reduce them back graciously when the merchants, Lords and commonfolks would come begging an audience with the King to control his Hand. These people would naturally go home and talk about the hand's wickedness and the King's kindness. A most accomplished mummer, the mad King was.</p>
<p>Over all it seems like while the noble class and the Maesters all agree that Aerys II was a monster, the smallfolk do not appear to share their views.</p>
<p>How much did the public know about the extent of his madness and cruelty? I know there's nothing in the books about that since they are written from POV of nobles, have the author or his associates commented on that?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","212584","<p>King Aerys attended the Tourney at Harrenhal and it was the first time he left the Red Keep in years. His appearance drew even more people in and so there would have been lots of common folk there. In the below quotes it makes it obvious that his madness would be clear for all to see. As the king would be seen in public and probably seen acting like that gossip would spread to how mad he was there. Even if commoners watching the tourney didn't see, serving girls and servants in the background would most likely have done.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Such events were widely popular with the commons</strong>, however, and when Lord Merryweather warned Aerys that forbidding the tournament would only serve to make him even more unpopular, the king chose another course and announced his intention to attend. It would mark the first time that Aerys II had left the safety of the Red Keep since the Defiance of Duskendale. No doubt His Grace reasoned that his enemies would not dare conspire against him under his very nose. Grand Maester Pycelle tells us that Aerys hoped that his presence at such a grand event would help him win back the love of his people.</p>
<p>If that was indeed the king's intent, it was a grievous miscalculation. <strong>Whilst his attendance made the Harrenhal tourney even grander and more prestigious than it already was</strong>, drawing lords and knights from every corner of the realm, many of those who came were shocked and appalled when they saw what had become of their monarch. <strong>His long yellow fingernails, tangled beard, and ropes of unwashed, matted hair made the extent of the king's madness plain to all. Nor was his behavior that of a sane man, for Aerys could go from mirth to melancholy in the blink of an eye, and many of the accounts written of Harrenhal speak of his hysterical laughter, long silences, bouts of weeping, and sudden rages.</strong></p>
<p><sub><em>The World of Ice and Fire</em>, The Fall of the Dragons: The Year of the False Spring</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of that Aerys made a public show of annointing Jaime into the Kingsguard at the start of the Tourney so they probably would have seen him there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the tourney's opening ceremonies, King Aerys made a great public show of Ser Jaime Lannister's investiture as a Sworn Brother of his Kingsguard. The young knight said his vows before the royal pavilion, kneeling on the green grass in his white armor as half the lords of the realm looked on. When Ser Gerold Hightower raised him up and clasped his white cloak about his shoulders, a roar went up from the crowd, for Ser Jaime was much admired for his courage, gallantry, and prowess with a sword, especially in the westerlands.</p>
<p><sub><em>The World of Ice and Fire</em>, The Fall of the Dragons: The Year of the False Spring</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The depiction of the Tourney in <em>The World of Ice and Fire</em> shows that Aerys would be at least somewhat visible to those watching it.</p>

<p>With all this in mind I think it's safe to say the gossip would have spread like wildfire and that the King's madness would be well known even if not believed.</p>

<p>Is there any evidence that he rose to such power because of such blackmailing?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","212555","<p>This answer is based mostly on the books, because:</p>

<ol>
<li>They provide more lore on the subject.</li>
<li>I haven't seen the show.</li>
</ol>

<p>People with the abilities of the Three-Eyed Raven (or Three-Eyed Crow as he is referred to in the books) are properly referred to as <strong><a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Greenseer"" rel=""noreferrer"">Greenseers</a>.</strong> There is no evidence such a being has ever sat the Iron Throne, and there is a great deal of lore suggesting that none ever has.</p>

<p>The Greensight ability originated with the <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Children_of_the_forest"" rel=""noreferrer"">Children of the Forest</a>. They were driven north of the Wall by either the First men or the Andals long before the Targaryens conquered Westeros and established the Iron Throne. The ability persists among the people of the North and the Neck, such as Bran Stark and (in the books) Jojen Reed, because these peoples have ancient Westerosi ancestry going back to the First Men. I believe that their Greensight is evidence suggesting that their ancestors also interbred with the Children of the Forest.</p>

<p>The only other character known to be a Greenseer is <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Brynden_Rivers"" rel=""noreferrer"">Brynden Rivers</a>, previously known as Lord Bloodraven. This is the character known in the show as <em>the</em> Three-Eyed Raven. He was Hand of the King and master of spies a hundred years before the show begins, but never a King in his own right. He had a reputation as a sorcerer, and it was widely believed that he had magical abilities to see what was happening throughout the Kingdom. I don't know if it's ever confirmed that he used Greensight during this time or whether that ability only manifested after he went north of the Wall and met the Children of the Forest. While he is not from the North, being the bastard child of King Aegon IV Targaryen and <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Melissa_Blackwood"" rel=""noreferrer"">Melissa Blackwood</a>, he <em>does</em> carry the blood of the First Men, since his mother's family was driven from the North by the Starks thousands of years ago. </p>

<p>While he was never a King, he is certainly an example of a powerful character whose greatest weapon was information (although his bow was nothing to scoff at either). He rose to power after slaying his half-brother, Daemon Blackfyre, during the <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/First_Blackfyre_Rebellion"" rel=""noreferrer"">First Blackfyre Rebellion</a>. It is unclear to what extent, if any, his uncanny abilities were key to this victory.</p>

<p>The only houses to sit the Iron Throne are Targaryen, Baratheon (briefly), and Lannister (currently). There is no evidence of any of these lineages having Greensight, as none of them are descended from the Children of the Forest. </p>

<p>So it seems very likely that if </p>

<p>he will be:</p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","212575","<p>No Jaime did not care for Joffrey. When Joffrey was born, Jaime was expressly forbidden by Cersei to not to show or harbour any affections for Joffrey out of fear that someone might discover their secret.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jaime had seen him born, that was true, though more for Cersei than
  the child. <strong>But he had never held him. ""How would it look?"" his sister
  warned him</strong> when the women finally left them. ""Bad enough Joff looks
  like you without you mooning over him."" <strong>Jaime yielded with hardly a
  fight</strong>. The boy had been a squalling pink thing who demanded too much
  of Cersei's time, Cersei's love, and Cersei's breasts. <strong>Robert was
  welcome to him</strong>. <br><sub>A Storm of Swords - Jaime VII</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And When he learnt that Joffrey died, Jaime was concerned only about how Cersei would be feeling and he did not feel distressed himself at all.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The king is dead, they told him, never knowing that Joffrey was his
  son as well as his sovereign.</p>
  
  <p>""The Imp opened his throat with a dagger,"" a costermonger declared at
  the roadside inn where they spent the night. ""He drank his blood from
  a big gold chalice."" The man did not recognize the bearded one-handed
  knight with the big bat on his shield, no more than any of them, so he
  said things he might otherwise have swallowed, had he known who was
  listening.</p>
  
  <p>""The dwarf's wife did the murder with him,"" swore an archer in Lord
  Rowan's livery. ""Afterward, she vanished from the hall in a puff of
  brimstone, and a ghostly direwolf was seen prowling the Red Keep,
  blood dripping from his jaws."" Jaime sat silent through it all,
  letting the words wash over him, a horn of ale forgotten in his one
  good hand. Joffrey. My blood. My firstborn. My son. He tried to bring
  the boy's face to mind, but his features kept turning into Cersei's.
  She will be in mourning, her hair in disarray and her eyes red from
  crying, her mouth trembling as she tries to speak. She will cry again
  when she sees me, though she'll fight the tears. His sister seldom
  wept but when she was with him. She could not stand for others to
  think her weak. Only to her twin did she show her wounds. She will
  look to me for comfort and revenge. <br><sub>A Storm of Swords - Jaime VII</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then we see that Jaime realises that he simply felt nothing for the child who might have been his seed but was not his son. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>He was curiously calm. Men were supposed to go mad with grief when
  their children died, he knew</strong>. They were supposed to tear their hair
  out by the roots, to curse the gods and swear red vengeance. <strong>So why
  was it that he felt so little?</strong> The boy lived and died believing Robert
  Baratheon his sire. [.....]</p>
  
  <p>And now he’s dead. <strong>He pictured Joff lying still and cold with a face
  black from poison, and still felt nothing. Perhaps he was the monster
  they claimed. If the Father Above came down to offer him back his son
  or his hand, Jaime knew which he would choose</strong>. He had a second son,
  after all, and seed enough for many more. <strong>If Cersei wants another
  child I’ll give her one... and this time I’ll hold him</strong>, and the Others
  take those who do not like it. Robert was rotting in his grave, and
  Jaime was sick of lies. <br><sub>A Storm of Swords - Jaime VII</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He did not rape Cersei beside Joffrey's bier in the books, He took the initiative but Cersei wanted it as well. There he notes, irritated, to himself how his sister keeps referring to their son as ""My Son"". </p>

<p>And later he clearly states how he feels about his children. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You were Robert’s queen. And yet you won’t be mine.”</p>
  
  <p>“I would, if I dared. But our son—”</p>
  
  <p>“Tommen is no son of mine, no more than Joffrey was.” His voice was
  hard. “You made them Robert’s too.” <br><sub>A Feast for Crows - Jaime I</sub> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in conclusion:</p>

<ol>
<li>Jaime does not seem like the traditional fatherly sort, although that might have been because of his sister's lies and secrets that made Jaime sick. Nevertheless He was only too glad to stop developing any affection for Joff. He did however feel affection for Tommen and Myrcella.</li>
<li>Jaime resented the fact that his sister made the children Robert's and hers. While he's irritated whenever she says something along those lines, he certainly doesn't make any effort to remedy that himself. </li>
<li>Jaime didn't feel any sorrow at Joffrey's death, he'd practiced apathy towards the boy for far too long. The fact that he'd rather choose a hand than Joffrey's life if he were given a choice says it all.</li>

"212637","Why didn't King Jaehaerys Targaryen think himself a Kinslayer?","<p>In <em>Fire and Blood</em> we see that Lord Rogar Baratheon's younger brother Borys Baratheon joined hands with the Vulture King and starts raiding his own people from the Dornish Red Mountains. For those crimes and to secure the Stormlands, Lord Rogar Baratheon sought his step-son King Jaehaerys I's leave to take an army into the Red Mountains to deal with the threat. Jaehaerys not only granted permission, but joined the Stormlander expedition himself. Then we see something interesting happen when Lord Rogar came face to face with his brother.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Rogar’s men made short work of his own, but as the brothers came face-to-face, King Jaehaerys descended from the sky. <strong>“I would not have you named a kinslayer, my lord,” His Grace told his former Hand. “The traitor is mine.”</strong></p>
<p>Ser Borys laughed to hear it. “<strong>Rather name me a kingslayer than
him a kinslayer!</strong>” he shouted, as he rushed the king. But Jaehaerys had
Blackfyre in hand, and he had not forgotten the lessons he had learned
in the yard on Dragonstone. <strong>Borys Baratheon died at the king’s feet,
from a cut to his neck that near took his head off.</strong><br> <sub><em>Fire and Blood: Volume 1</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Jaehaerys kills Borys himself so that men could not name Lord Rogar a Kinslayer. Yet Borys was kin to Jaehaerys himself as well. King Aegon I Targaryen and Lord Orys Baratheon were half brothers. So that would make Aegon's grandson Jaehaerys and Orys' grandson Borys second cousins. While Lord Aerion never acknowledged Orys, Jaehaerys considered it a fact.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Dragonseeds, they call them,” Jaehaerys said with obvious
reluctance. “It is not a thing to boast of, but it has happened, mayhaps
more often than we would care to admit. Such children are cherished,
though. <strong>Orys Baratheon himself was a dragonseed, a bastard brother
to our grandsire. Whether he was conceived of a first night I cannot
say, but Lord Aerion was his father, that was well-known</strong>. Gifts were
given…”<br><sub><em>Fire and Blood: Volume 1</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also worth noting that Borys himself thinks that killing Jaehaerys would make him a Kingslayer, not kinslayer.</p>
<p>Anyway, Of course Jaehaerys was not as closely related to Borys as Lord Rogar but we know that even much distant kinship counts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Rickard Karstark dipped his head stiffly. &quot;For that much, I thank
you. But for naught else.&quot; He had dressed for death in a long black
wool surcoat emblazoned with the white sunburst of his House. &quot;<strong>The
blood of the First Men flows in my veins as much as yours, boy</strong>. You
would do well to remember that. I was named for your grandfather. I
raised my banners against King Aerys for your father, and against King
Joffrey for you. At Oxcross and the Whispering Wood and in the Battle
of the Camps, I rode beside you, and I stood with Lord Eddard on the
Trident. <strong>We are kin, Stark and Karstark</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This kinship did not stop you from betraying me,&quot; Robb said. &quot;And it
will not save you now. Kneel, my lord.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Lord Rickard had spoken truly, Catelyn knew. The Karstarks traced
their descent to Karlon Stark</strong>, a younger son of Winterfell who had put
down a rebel lord a thousand years ago, and been granted lands for his
valor. The castle he built had been named Karl's Hold, but that soon
became Karhold, and <strong>over the centuries the Karhold Starks had become
Karstarks</strong>.</p>
<p>&quot;Old gods or new, it makes no matter,&quot; Lord Rickard told her son, &quot;<strong>no
man is so accursed as the kinslayer.</strong>&quot;<br><sub><em>A Storm of Swords</em> - Catelyn III</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jaehaerys could have ordered any man at arms to slay Borys and saved both Rogar and himself from the sin of Kinslaying. Or was he just counting on the fact that since Orys was never acknowledged by Lord Aerion or King Aegon and their status as a cadet branch of House Targaryen was never officially accepted by any noble, no one would be able to name him a Kinslayer?</p>
<p>The AWOIAF semi canon wiki seems to hold that Jaehaerys never knew for certain the circumstances surrounding Orys' birth so his belief doesn't make it a fact necessarily but given that we are talking about his decision, certainly his belief counts there.</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","212641","<p>Kinslaying is spoken about as a subjective matter and up to each individual how they define what would class as kinslaying or not, or at least what would be &quot;bad enough&quot; to be labelled as kinslaying. George has spoken about it below and goes into detail over different things that would change people's perception of it. A couple of the important things relevant here are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Killing with your own hand is worse than ordering someone else to do it but ordering someone else to or the like is worse than them just dying in a battle where you face each other.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Lord Karstark was stretching that degree of kinship between him and Robb apparently just to save his own skin so others probably wouldn't call Robb a kinslayer.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em><strong>&quot;There are obvious degrees of guilt, depending...&quot;</strong></em> This one seems particuarly important as it is talking about the way the &quot;killer&quot; perceives the kinslaying themselves and how much guilt they face from it depending on other factors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A ton of us Boarders have been debating the taboo against kinslaying in Westeros, and have been trying to define exactly what &quot;kinslaying&quot; is. Is it limited only to the situation where you kill a kinsman by your own hand, or would it include anything that leads to the death of a kinsman? In other words, had Renly's army defeated Stannis', and Stannis died in the battle at the hands of Loras Tyrell, would Renly still be considered a &quot;kinslayer&quot;?</em></p>
<p>Maybe by some, but that's a stretch.</p>
<p><strong>There are degrees in kinslaying, as in anything else.</strong> Fighting a battle in which a brother dies might be frowned upon, but killing him with your own hand would be considered far worse.</p>
<p>In the scenario you propose, another factor might be whether Renly gave any orders in respect to Stannis. Did he command Loras to kill him, or offer a reward to whosoever slew his brother? Did he tell his men to see that his brother was taken alive? Did he not address the issue either way? <strong>There are obvious degrees of guilt, depending...</strong></p>
<p>The other factor, which you haven't raised, is degree of kinship. <strong>Killing a parent is probably worse than killing a sibling, but either one is a lot worse than killing a distant cousin.</strong> Lord Karstark was stretching that aspect of it when he tried to accuse Robb of kinslaying... but of course he was hoping to save his head.</p>

"145010","Why was Balon Greyjoy allowed to keep his titles and head after losing his rebellion?","<p>Balon Greyjoy clearly committed treason when he rebelled against Robert Baratheon. Why wasn't he executed, or stripped of his titles and forced to take the black? If Robert had appointed someone else as Lord of the Iron Islands he could probably be assured of the new Lord's gratitude and loyalty for a few years at least. Apart from yielding Theon as a hostage and having his castle walls destroyed, it doesn't seem like Balon suffered any punishment at all.</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","145086","<h3>Robert's personality and principles</h3>
<p>That is because Robert of that time and age was an honorable man who did not despise a foe for fighting against him if the cause was just.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;On the Trident, Ser Barristan here cut down a dozen good men,
Robert's friends and mine. When they brought him to us, grievously
wounded and near death, Roose Bolton urged us to cut his throat, but
your brother said, '<strong>I will not kill a man for loyalty, nor for</strong>
<strong>fighting well,' and sent his own maester to tend Ser Barristan's</strong>
<strong>wounds.&quot;</strong> He gave the king a long cool look. &quot;Would that man were here
today.&quot;<br> <sub><em><strong>AGOT-Eddard VII</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only this, Robert pardoned almost all the Lords who fought for Aerys Targaryen because he recognized that they were fighting for a cause that they saw as just and honorable. Back then, Robert was the living manifestation of chivalry.</p>
<h3>The Rebellion</h3>
<p>Soon after Robert taking the throne, Balon Greyjoy rose in rebellion. GRRM <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/2997/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">has explained</a> why did Balon consider it wise to rise against Robert:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He (Balon) believed that Robert, as a usurper, might not have the
strong support of the other lords the way that a Targaryen king would
have. He also thought he could defeat Robert at sea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The year was 289 AC. Robert moved swiftly and his Wardens Tywin Lannister and Eddard Stark joined their levies to the Royal Forces. Stannis Baratheon commanded his brother's fleet and smashed the Ironfleet in naval battle.</p>
<p>Soon, the Royal Armies overran the Iron Islands and Walls of Pyke were smashed down.</p>
<h3>So why did Robert do it?</h3>
<p>The conversation between the defeated Balon Greyjoy and Victorious King Robert is recorded in TWOIAF:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reborn Kingdom of the Iron Isles had lasted less than a year. Yet
when Balon Greyjoy was brought before King Robert in chains, the
ironman remained defiant. <strong>&quot;You may take my head,&quot;</strong> he told the
king, <strong>&quot;but you cannot name me traitor. No Greyjoy ever swore an oath
to a Baratheon.&quot;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Robert Baratheon, ever merciful, is said to have laughed at that, for he liked spirit in a man, even in his foes. &quot;Swear one now,&quot; he
replied, &quot;or lose that stubborn head of yours.&quot;</strong> And so Balon Greyjoy
bent his knee and was allowed to live, after giving up his last
surviving son as a hostage to his loyalty.<br><sub><em><strong>TWOIAF: The Iron Islands: The Old Way and the New</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So as evident, you can see that Robert did it because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Balon was correct. No Greyjoy had ever sworn an oath of allegiance to a Baratheon.</li>
<li>Robert admired bravery and Balon was beyond a doubt brave.</li>
<li>Robert admired the kind of spirit Balon had.</li>
<li>Robert was chivalrous and admired good qualities in his foes.</li>
</ol>
<h3>What do the other Westerosi minds think on treatment of fallen foes?</h3>
<p>Removing House Greyjoy or reducing Ironlslander power is a very bad idea because Cersei thinks almost the same way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Robert should have scoured the isles after Balon Greyjoy rose against
him, Cersei thought. He smashed their fleet, burned their towns, and
broke their castles, but when he had them on their knees he let them
up again. <strong>He should have made another island of their skulls.</strong> That
was what her father would have done, but Robert never had the stomach
that a king requires if he hopes to keep peace in the
realm.<br><sub><strong><em>AFFC - Cersei VII</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She is wrong however when she says her father would have done the same. Tywin Lannister was no fool. He explained his views on such matters to Joffrey.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Be quiet, Cersei. Joffrey, <strong>when your enemies defy you, you must
serve them steel and fire. When they go to their knees, however, you
must help them back to their feet. Elsewise no man will ever bend the
knee to you</strong>. And any man who must say 'I am the king' is no true
king at all.&quot;<br><sub><strong><em>ASOS - Tyrion VI</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Robert's rule was insecure. He wanted to win hearts of his vassals, not push them to the brink where they thought that any act against the usurper would lead to end of their status. This feeling only serves to stiffen the resistance. On the other hand, by issuing pardons you give your enemies hope that if they surrender, you are capable of forgiving them which leads to quicker surrenders. And generally, Pardoning people leads to winning their hearts permanently e.g. in case of Barristan Selmy and Lord Tyrell, it worked for Robert. Robert had also previously used his chivalry and charisma to turn Lords <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lord_Cafferen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cafferen</a>, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lord_Grandison"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Grandison</a> and <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lord_Fell"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fell</a> from Rebels to his Loyal bannermen.</p>
<p>In any case, Greyjoys are the most prestigious family in the Iron Islands. They were chosen by Iron Islanders to be their lords when Aegon I Targaryen conquered Iron Islands and ever since, they have ruled the Iron Islands and commanded their loyalty. Iron Islanders would take it as an insult to have their most prominent house destroyed.</p>

<p>We simply do not know that. GRRM is deliberately vague about time, distances etc so we can't correctly figure out the rate on our own either. He merely at max gives us a vague idea by giving us a year and that's about it. And even the years are rare, most of the time he just doesn't discuss time so that fans couldn't find errors in his calculations. To Quote GRRM on distances and time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[How big is Westeros? Is it the size of Europe, or even larger?]</p>
<p>I have deliberately tried to be vague about such things, so I don't have obsessive fans with rulers measuring distances on the map and telling me Ned couldn't get from X to Y in the time I say he did.</p>
<p>However, if you really must know, you can figure out the distances for yourself. The Wall is a hundred leagues long. A league is three miles. Go from there.</p>
<p>But if you turn up any mistakes in travel times by using that measure, let it be your secret.<br><sub><em><a href=""https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/2787"" rel=""noreferrer"">Citadel - So Spake Martin</a></em></sub></p>

<hr />
<h3>Speculation</h3>
<p>Let's take Joffrey Velaryon as the measuring stick here.</p>
<p>He was born in 117 AC at Dragonstone and a dragon egg was placed in his crib by command of his Royal Grandfather Viserys I. The dragon, named Tyraxes, hatched at some unknown point of time but it is estimated it was no later than 120 AC.</p>
<p>The Dance of the Dragon began in 129 AC, some 9 years after it, if we assume Tryaxes hatched in 120 AC. Bear in mind, Tyraxes was at Dragonstone, the place which was considered best for growth and health of dragons. Yet, after growing for 9 years, Tyraxes was still not old enough to fly to long distances alone<br><sup>1</sup> but it was large enough to carry the young Prince. It was however considered too young for war, unlike the dragons Arrax and Vermax which were bonded to Joffrey's older brothers. We do not know if Tyraxes' slower growth was because it hatched late or simply because Joffrey's brothers' dragons were more robust.</p>
<p>We do know from Daenerys' dragons that three dragons born at the same time can have different growth rate e.g. Drogon always ate more, was more daring and grew faster and larger. Rhaegel and Viserion were not that physically robust and certainly their captivity in Meereen didn't help.</p>
<p>In any case, I believe since Drogon had started flying off to long distances and by the end of ADWD, he was large enough to carry Daenerys to the skies, he must have been slightly larger or at least the same size as Tyraxes was when the war began. Drogon, we do know, was born somewhere in 299 AC. We know Daenerys took Meereen within the same year. Tyraxes took 9 years to grow to that size, that too in the environment considered best for dragons. Drogon seems to have grown nearly that much, if not more within one to two years given that Daenerys' flight happens in Meereen, after second siege of Astapor which happened in 300 AC.</p>
<p>But it is possible that Tyraxes is the wrong measuring tape here, we perhaps should have used Arrax or Vermax for comparison with Drogon since Arrax and Vermax showed faster growth despite being born at more or less the same time as Tyraxes. And not to mention another flawed premise in our calculation, while Tyraxes could take Prince Joffrey to skies after 9 years, that doesn't necessarily mean that the first flight occurred after 9 years. So when did Prince Joffrey first flew atop his dragon? So now let's look at Joffrey's half brother Aegon the Younger (Later Aegon III). Aegon was born in 120 AC and just like his brothers, an egg was placed in his crib, which hatched into a Dragon named Stormcloud. When the war broke out 9 years later, the Prince had bonded with the dragon but hadn't flown since the Dragon was too small for him. The Prince's solo flight with his dragon was when he desperately clutch to his bleeding dragon's neck in order to escape from the attacking fleets of the Kingdom of Three Daughters. So after 9 years, Stormcloud still wasn't old enough to serve as a proper mount for Aegon III. But OTOH, we do not know when Stormcloud was hatched.</p>
<p>In any case, even if the dragons Tyraxes and Stormcloud weren't born in 120 AC and we are off by a few years, one thing seems clear, <strong>Daenerys' dragons have grown faster than other dragons</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<p><sub><strong>1.</strong> Not deemed suitable to fly alone without a rider seems more of a comment on fear of losing a dragon rather than its inability to fly as such. A riderless young dragon presumably seeks out new lairs just as Drogon did with the hill in Dothraki sea that Dany dubbed her Dragonstone. Older dragons, I suppose, can be trusted to return back to the lair they are used to  even if they are riderless i.e. Dragonstone or King's Landing. Dragons are solitary animals and they do not have a herd behaviour. In the Wild, Dragons live alone, presumably seeking company only to mate.</sub></p>

"212731","How good of a King was Jaehaerys I?","<p>We have all read about the prosperous and long reign of Jaehaerys I, The Conciliator, and Good Queen Alyssane. He is regarded as the best Targaryen monarch. </p>

<p>However, the question is how much of his success was due to his own skill and how much was due to people like Septon Barth, Grand Maester Benifer, The Lord Velaryon etc. </p>

<p>Would his reign be as good without people like them on his small council?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","212734","<p>It seems from the perspective of the Maesters that Jaehaerys started out a great guy and this was furthered by his wife and council. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Though young to the throne, Jaehaerys revealed himself from an early age to be a true king. He was a fine warrior, skilled with lance and bow, and a gifted horseman. He was a dragonrider as well, riding upon Vermithor—a great beast of bronze and tan who was the largest of the living dragons after Balerion and Vhagar. Decisive in thought and deed, Jaehaerys was wise beyond his years, always seeking the most peaceable ends.<br></p>
</blockquote>

<p> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>His queen, Alysanne, was also well loved throughout the realm, being both beautiful and high-spirited, as well as charming and keenly intelligent. Some said that she ruled the realm as much as the king did, and there was some truth to that. It was at her behest that King Jaehaerys at last forbade the right of the First Night, despite the many lords who jealously guarded it.<br></p>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With Barth's aid and advice, King Jaehaerys did more to reform the realm than any other king who lived before or after. Where his grandsire, King Aegon, had left the laws of the Seven Kingdoms to the vagaries of local tradition and custom, Jaehaerys created the first unified code, so that from the North to the Dornish Marches, the realm shared a single rule of law. Great works to improve King's Landing were also implemented—drains and sewers and wells, especially, for Barth believed that fresh water and the flushing away of offal and waste were important to a city's health. Furthermore, the Conciliator began the construction of the great network of roads that would one day join King's Landing to the Reach, the stormlands, the westerlands, the riverlands, and even the North—understanding that to knit together the realm it must be easier to travel among its regions. The kingsroad was the greatest of these roads, reaching hundreds of leagues to Castle Black and the Wall.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it was quite natural for Jaehaerys to go down in history as one of the greatest if not <em>the</em> greatest of the Targaryen kings. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>King Jaehaerys, the First of His Name—known as the Conciliator, and the Old King (being the only Targaryen ruler who lived to such an advanced age)—died peacefully in his bed in 103 AC, while Lady Alicent read to him from his friend Barth's Unnatural History. He was nine-and-sixty at his death, and had ruled wisely and well for five-and-fifty years. Westeros mourned, and it was claimed that even in Dorne men wept and women tore their garments in lament for a king who had been so just and good. His ashes were interred with that of his beloved, the Good Queen Alysanne, beneath the Red Keep. And the realm never saw their like again.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><sub> All above quotes from <em>The World of Ice and Fire - The Targaryen Kings: Jaehaerys I</em></sub></p>

<p>So how much of this can be credited to Jaehaerys himself or to his council? It was all teamwork among those who loved each other and were friends. However, in the end the king has the final say and his own tendencies (good or bad) would ultimately shine through. </p>

I thought there might have been something in the conversation Davos had before being smuggled into White Harbor, but I couldn't stretch anything that far.</p>

<p>What evidence do proponents of this theory cite?  Does any of it involve stuff in the texts or just sweeping generalizations of the characters' personalities (e.g. ""Ned Stark is too honorable to father a bastard"").</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><jon-snow>","7030","<p>Like the previous answer stated, its a very big and expansive issue. But I'll list a few highlights:</p>

<p><strong>Reasons to doubt that Eddard is Jon's father:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Eddard is honorable to a fault and, from what we've seen, extremely self disciplined.</p></li>
<li><p>In a flashback, when pressed by his wife he only states that Jon is ""his blood"", never outright saying that he is his father. Eddard being coy with words to avoid a lie?</p></li>
<li><p>Eddard <em>always</em> avoids speaking of his possible parenting of Jon. Shame at a youthful lapse of honor? Or to hide something else?</p></li>
<li><p>In the TV version, just before Jon leaves for the Wall, Eddard promises Jon that when they meet again he will discuss Jon's parentage with him, implying that until then Eddard has something to hide.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Reasons to affirm that Eddard is Jon's father:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>In the aforementioned investigation by Catelyn, a recurring rumor was that the mother was Ashara Dayne. It is implied by other flashbacks (principally the story of the Knight of the Laughing Tree) that Ashara and Eddard shared a mutual attraction. </p></li>
<li><p>When pressed by Robert, Eddard claims the mother is a servant girl named Wylla. Edric Dayne claims to Arya Stark that Wylla was his wet nurse (making him Jon's milk brother), giving more credence to the story, and that Wylla was not just a name Eddard made up to shut people up.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Reasons that imply Jon is Lyanna Stark's son:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>A recurring dream/flashback of Eddard's is arriving at Lyanna's death bed, drenched in blood and her extracting a ""promise"" from Ned. It is speculated that this scene is Lyanna dying from birth complications, and asking Ned to hide her child.</p></li>
<li><p>It is mentioned more than once that Jon looks a lot like Arya. And Arya herself greatly resembles her dead aunt; Lyanna. Hereditary Stark look? Or an indication about who Jon's mother is?</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Reasons that imply Jon is a Targaryen-Stark:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>It is implied by many flashbacks (mainly of the tourney at Harrenhall) that there existed an affair between Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark.</p>

<p>When Arstan Whitebeard and Daenerys are speaking during the battle of Yunkai:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But that was the tourney when he [Rhaegar] crowned Lyanna Stark as queen of love and beauty!” said Dany. “Princess Elia was there, his wife, and yet my brother gave the crown to the Stark girl, and later stole her away from her betrothed. ...""</p>
  
  <p><em>-A Song of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Pt. 2 (Blood and Gold).</em></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>During the sack of King's Landing that won Robert the throne, while Targaryens were being slaughtered left and right; three of the Kingsguard (almost <em>half!</em>) were deployed to guard the Tower of Joy, where Lyanna was. If Lyanna were just a prisoner (as Robert claims) why all the security? Perhaps they were guarding something very precious to Rhaegar?</p></li>
<li><p>Many prophecies claim that the ""Song of Ice and Fire"" will be humanity's salvation. Rhaegar was obsessed with them. Ice = Stark, Fire = Targaryen?</p></li>

<p>That's all I can remember at the moment. But I'm sure there are more.</p>

Needless to say, North as an Independent Kingdom existed back then and the Wall was definitely not in Principality of Dorne's control.</p>

<p>Of course as you say, Sansa can try and pry away Jon, and Jon can try to escape. After all, Aegor Rivers, commonly known as 'Bittersteel' was rescued when his ship en-route to the Watch was intercepted by his friends. But will Sansa commit such a dishonourable act? Brandon will be forced to enforce his will or his word would count for less. Will Jon be willing to do that? He never wanted anything to do with the politics and administration, he's going home for all he cares. And if Jon does desert or escape, Sansa will have to execute him/hand him back to the watch if he deserts, try to capture him if he escapes. Otherwise Stark honour means for less. </p>

<p>And What happens if the Word reaches the Unsullied that they were played for a fool and their Queen's murderer now sits beside his sister in Winterfell? You can expect Yara Greyjoy, who sided openly with Greyworm, would definitely make sure that the word does reach them. With Ironborn descending from the West and Unsullied from the East, North would be smashed even if Bran takes no hand. Doing so will also give Yara the allies she needs to win her independence with fire and steel after Sansa tricked them all into accepting her brother as King, in case she resents that and wishes to fulfil her father's mission. Giving Jon refuge will:</p>

<ol>
<li>Dishonour Starks</li>
<li>Make Sansa look weak and unjust</li>
<li>Put the North in risk of a conflict with the Six Kingdoms and the Unsullied.</li>
</ol>

<p>And you forget, as Tyrion said, Half the country hates people who betrayed Daenerys. Jon would always be at risk of assassination down south by Targaryen loyalists.</p>

"7183","Why did Robb attack Tywin Lannister's Army at the same time as his surprise attack on Jaime?","<p>In Game of Thrones, Robb Stark decides on a two-pronged attack against the two Lannister armies. He sends a small force to move quickly and attack the main Lannister army, led by Lord Tywin, head-on, resulting in massive casualties to that subdivision of the Northern army. </p>

<p>At the same time, he takes most of his Northern army and lures Jaime Lannister away from his siege of Riverrun, capturing him in the battle of Whispering Wood (leading to the subsequent routing of Jaime's army).</p>

<p>If the success of his strategy hinged on capturing Jaime (which he was able to do), then why did he attack Tywin at the same time? </p>

<p>It is not as if Tywin could warn Jaime that he was being attacked by the main Stark-led army (leading Jaime to believe that he was safe from the Northerners), since Jaime could not receive any messenger ravens (as he did not have a fixed point to which they could be sent) - and we do not see Tywin send warning in any event. And in any event, Robb is quite successful in masking his movements from Jaime.</p>

<p>If he just wanted to prevent Tywin from coming swiftly to counter-attack Robb once word got to him about the capture of Jaime, that doesn't make sense either, since:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tywin had no easy way to get there, once Robb allied himself with the Freys (who controlled the main river crossing)</li>
<li>Robb could have stationed his secondary force in ambush along the route that Tywin would have had to take. This would probably have been more efficient than the direct assault of an overmatched Northerner force against the Lannister army</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems that the book portrays Robb's decision to split his forces in this way as a key to the success of his victory and capture of Jaime Lanister in Whispering Wood. In so doing, he knowingly sacrificed most of the force sent against Tywin Lannister. But why did he need to do this? He could still have gotten Jaime without attacking Tywin directly, and kept a larger number of his soldiers and bannermen alive or uncaptured in the process? What am I missing?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><warfare><geography>","131147","<p>System Down has sufficiently answered this question. </p>

<p>This is merely to add graphical representation to add more clarity to the situation.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Situation before the crossing</h2>

<p>Before Robb made his crossing of the Trident, the situation was following.</p>

<ol>
<li>Jaime's host had besieged Riverrun from multiple directions. (Shown as three hosts because Riverrun had to be besieged by three different sides)</li>
<li>Robb Stark was stuck North of trident at The Twins, trying to figure out a way to break siege of Riverrun.</li>
<li>Tywin Lannister had occupied the Ruby Ford and made the Inn at Crossroads his headquarter.</li>
</ol>

<p>At that point, Walder Frey was neutral and had kinship with Casterly Rock due to marriage between Lord Tywin's sister Genna and Lord Walder's son Emmon. Siezing the initiative, Tywin occupied the ruby ford and sat firmly on the Kingsroad to repulse a Stark attempt to cross the river from there and outflank Jaime's host. By occupying that point, he also made sure that if Arryns bestirred, they would have to fight him before they ever get to Riverlands.</p>

<p>Tyrion joined his father at the Crossroads inn when he got free from Eyrie.</p>

<p>Following map will show you exact positions of all hosts:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vmk9G.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vmk9G.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>As you can see, If Robb moved against Jaime directly, Tywin would have marched quickly southwards across the ford, then cut Westward until they crossed the red fork and then together Jaime and Tywin could finish Robb. So Robb had to secure his flank and rear from Tywin and also had to relieve Riverrun. Instead of staking everything on one battle, Robb chose to divide his men and tie Tywin in Ruby ford while he could smash Jaime's host freely using mobility of his Cavalry.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Situation After the Crossing</h2>

<p>As it turned out, Freys joined Robb. Robb took most of his Cavalry and crossed on Southern Bank of the Twins. He was going to ride fast and hard to Riverrun and take Jaime unaware. He gave command of his foot to Roose Bolton who struck South-East along the Kingsroad to engage Tywin Lannister at Ruby Ford and deny him the chance to aid Jaime. </p>

<p>Tywin failed to know about the split and Ser Addam Marbrand, commander of the Lannister outriders only managed to report about movement of Bolton's troops, which Tywin mistook to be main Stark body under command of Robb Stark. Following was the location of Armies after the crossing:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/k2ucc.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/k2ucc.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<hr>

<h2>Battles At Greenfork and Whispering Wood</h2>

<p>Robb's plan was successful. Bolton distracted Tywin long enough to allow Robb to defeat Jaime in Battle of Whispering Wood. Starks suffered heavy losses at Green Fork however they succeeded in delaying Tywin's aid to Jaime. Tywin failed to give a chase to survivors of Bolton's Army because he wanted to help Jaime in his siege.</p>

<p>Following is the map of Battles:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JbFNS.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JbFNS.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>As you can see, Tywin was stuck a long distance away, thinking that he was fighting Robb Stark. He was unaware that Robb had captured Jaime. Robb's simultaneous attacks in East and West had succeeded in achieving their ultimate objectives. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Aftermath</h2>

<p>Robb, now unopposed in West, quickly follows up on his victory and launches a surprise attack on Armies besieging Riverrun. In Battle of Camps, Lannister suffered a crushing defeat as leaderless Armies of captive Jaime Lannister were destroyed in their camps amidst a lot of confusion and disarray.</p>

<p>Tywin Lannister soon learns of these developments and retreats to Harrenhal to avoid encirclement by possible allied Baratheon-Stark forces and to be in a defensible position from where he could move to attack Starks or defend KL from a Baratheon attack. Roose Bolton moves to occupy Ruby Fork which was an extremely valuable position from strategic point of view as Possible allied Arryn Forces would have needed it to enter Riverlands and any Lannister adventure(However unlikely given the experience of Tywin and Kevan) northward to threaten Vale or North would have to pass from there.. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cj8FS.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cj8FS.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>So as evident, due to his simultaneous attack on Tywin Lannister and Jaime Lannister, Robb achieved following results:</p>

<ol>
<li>He tied Tywin down where he was unable to bail Jaime out.</li>
<li>He broke siege of Riverrun and destroyed a substantial part of Lannister power.</li>
<li>He made Tywin retreat to Harrenhal. </li>
<li>He won over Riverlords to his side by defending their lands and freeing Edmure Tully. </li>
<li>He blocked Lannister path to threaten North &amp; Vale by securing the Ruby Ford &amp; Twins.</li>
<li>He was now poised to attack the Lannisters in their own lands in the West, with the only Lannister Army trapped in Harrenhal with enemies on all compass points; Robb in West, Bolton in North, Renly and his Baratheon-Tyrell forces in South and Stannis Baratheon in the east.</li>
</ol>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","213095","<h1>Night's Watch</h1>

<p>The Night's Watch is somewhat of a democracy. They elect their Lord Commanders by majority vote. The Lord Command then rules for life, so whether this is really democracy can be questioned. </p>

<p>Why Samwell Tarly didn't mention this habit to strengthen his case during his suggestion in the final episode, one can only guess; it seems he has had some first-hand experience, but seems to have kind of forgotten.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sam, you're a sweet fool, he could hear Jon saying, all the way back to the maester's keep. Open your eyes. It's been happening for days. Could he be right? A man needed the votes of two-thirds of the Sworn Brothers to become the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, and after nine days and nine votes no one was even close to that. Lord Janos had been gaining, true, creeping up past first Bowen Marsh and then Othell Yarwyck, but he was still well behind Ser Denys Mallister of the Shadow Tower and Cotter Pyke of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. One of them will be the new Lord Commander, surely, Sam told himself.<br>
  <sub>A Storm of Swords - Samwell IV</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Volantis</h1>

<p>The Volantese also have elections, but there is no universal right to vote. These officials are elected for short terms.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The triarchs are neither kings nor princes. Volantis is a freehold, like Valyria of old. All freeborn landholders share the rule. Even women are allowed to vote, provided they own land. The three triarchs are chosen from amongst those noble families who can prove unbroken descent from old Valyria, to serve until the first day of the new year. And you would know all this if you had troubled to read the book that Maester Kedry gave you.""<br>

<h1>Iron Islands (sometimes)</h1>

<p>When they feel like it, the Ironborn of the Iron Islands elect their king in a Kingsmoot. Similarly to the Night's Watch it is questionable whether electing someone to rule as ""tyrant"" is really democracy, but it's another example of ""voting for your ruler"" as Sam intended.</p>

"145418","Is the Westerosi civilization in decline?","<p>After reading this question <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/20944/why-is-it-that-after-8-000-years-technology-in-westeros-has-not-evolved-in-the"">Why is it that after 8,000 years, technology in Westeros has not evolved in the world of the Game of Thrones?</a>, and of course reading the books, I asked myself if we could say the Westerosi civilization is ending.</p>

<p>Some elements :</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<p>They seem to not be able to build great castles as well as they used to, or even repair destroyed castles like <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Harrenhal"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Harrenhal</a>. Most of the castles were built hundreds of years ago (maybe thousands) and I don't think they could manage these projects <em>today</em>.</p>

<h2>Magic</h2>

<p>People have lost Magic knowledge and its usage is discouraged; for example Qyburn as the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Citadel"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Citadel</a> avoids this knowledge and denies its efficiency. Another example is Skinchanging, only known for a few people in the North but most of Southerners is unaware of this magic.</p>

<h2>Books</h2>

<p>Again, I'm not sure, but it seems they are not able to print books anymore. The books that are stated seem old and about old and almost forgotten or boring subjects. While sailing to Braavos, Sam brings rare books to the Citadel, noting that they are in urge of books, collecting all books they can.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_LKr2PoR3Y"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Some guy even dislikes books.</a></p>

<h2>Animals</h2>

<p>Many species have disapeared. <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Leaf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Leaf</a> said :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Now [the Sun] sinks, and this is our long dwindling. The giants are almost gone as well, they who were our bane and our brothers. The <strong>great lions</strong> of the western hills have been slain, the <strong>unicorns</strong> are all but gone, the <strong>mammoths</strong> down to a few hundred. The <strong>direwolves</strong> will outlast us all, but their time will come as well. In the world that men have made, there is no room for them, or us.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, I would like to ask if there are other exemples of forgotten knowledge.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","145421","<p>I agree that technology and progression in the world of A Song of Ice and Fire does seem stagnant - which as @Cearon O'Flynn mentioned in the comments, is a <em>very</em> common fantasy trope.</p>

<p>There are some in-universe explanations for the way things currently stand though:</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<p>Harrenhal is a particularly good example for this.<br>
It was built by Harren the Black purposefully built Harrenhal to be the biggest, most impressive fortress that had ever been created, as a not-so-subtle challenge to the authority of Aegon Targaryen. 
And Aegon burned him and his family alive inside it for his impudence.<br>
This is related to Arya by Tywin <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1v3fRfJBRk"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.
The lesson here is that the ruling nobility have made a conscious effort to keep those under their authority in line by force - this stifles too much defensive construction, as it could be seen as an effort to refuse their rule, and would be treated with great displeasure.<br>
You might also look to the Wall as an example of lost construction ability, but this involved a great deal of magic to build in addition to mundane building, which leads me to...</p>

<h2>Magic</h2>

<p>Your examples surrounding magic are unfortuantely a little incomplete.<br>
Skinchanging is a magic that was used by the Children of the Forest - one of the indigenous peoples of Westeros who had a great connection to the land and to nature - and were not human.<br>
Those who currently have the ability are those who have blood of the First Men, who likely interbred to a greater or lesser degree with the Children after the <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/The_Pact"" rel=""noreferrer"">Pact</a> was formed.<br>
The First Men had the greatest concentration in the North, and so the remnants of their bloodlines also lies there.</p>

<p>Qyburn was expelled from the Citadel for any number of practices seen to be distasteful - magic, yes, but also science. He conducts experiments on cadavers and performs other questionable practices, exploring darker knowledge than the Citadel aims to disseminate.<br>
Worth noting is that the Citadel itself studies magic - Maester Lewin and Bran <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sup-uOawuGw"" rel=""noreferrer"">discuss this</a>, and Lewin notes that he himself attempted to study magic, but found he did not possess the aptitude for it.</p>

<p>Finally, the reason for the theft of Daenerys's dragons in Qarth is that the presence of dragons in the world strengthens the power of magic - while dragons were seen to be extinct magic largely disappeared as a result. It's not as well covered in the show, but in the books there is mention that Melisandre's visions likely started with the hatching of Daenerys's dragons, as with Thoros of Myr's ability to revive Beric Dondarrion, and the warlocks in Qarth themselves being able to perform magic above simple parlour tricks.</p>

<h2>Books</h2>

<p>This one should be able to be attributes simply to their technology - they are at a technological level roughly equal to that of our Medieval Age.<br>
Literacy and availability of books didn't take off in our own world until the invention of the printing press - until that point books had to be produced individually by hand by scribes, making them incredibly painstaking to distribute. It also meant that it was unusual for there to be more than one copy of a given book, giving rise to great libraries (like the Citadel itself).</p>

<p>As said, their technology is stagnant, for fantasy handwavium reasons, as well as in-universe oppression, but surrounding that your given examples are explainable in and out of universe.</p>

<p>I'm going to add in a category of my own here as well:</p>

<h2>Economy</h2>

<p>As is stated in both the show and the books, Westeros is <em>heavily</em> in debt to various lenders, both in the forms of Houses like the Lannisters and the Tyrells, but also to the Iron Bank of Braavos.<br>
So, simply put, there isn't the budget for massive works to be constructed when the country as a whole (at least in terms of the government as a whole) is poor.</p>

<p>When you get outside Westeros there are plenty of notable constructions - the Pyramid of Meereen, the Titan of Braavos, even the Dothraki have the great bronze horse statues at the Horse Gate of Vaes Dothrak - and there is no evidence given that these couldn't be replicated given time and motivation, the only difference here is money.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Worth noting as well, is that a lot of the technological development that was carried out may have been lost along the way due to certain events - the one that springs to mind first and foremost is the secret to forging Valyrian Steel.<br>
Nobody has been able to reproduce the process to outright create it since the <a href=""http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Doom_of_Valyria"" rel=""noreferrer"">Doom of Valyria</a>, and there is no record of what other knowledge was lost in the same cataclysm - it's entirely possible that advanced methods of construction and other technological leaps were also lost in the same way.</p>

"7277","Does Tywin Lannister know Joffrey is Jaime's son?","<p>Tywin Lannister seems like a smart guy who wouldn't miss something as apparent as Joffrey not being Robert's son. At the same time, he has shown he cares about his family's honor and reputation (for example, by his hostile attitude towards Tyrion's hookers).</p>

<p>At the point of the story where <em>Clash of Kings</em> ends, is he aware of Joffrey's true parentage?  If so, has he shown any concern about this?</p>

<p>You're welcome to include references to the later books if those make it clearer what Tywin knew at this stage, but please enclose substantial events in spoiler markup.</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","18375","<p>As of the start of Clash of Kings, we have no <em>proof</em> that Jaime and Cersei's relationship and its results are known to any but a handful of people. The only living ones being Jaime, Cersei, Tyrion, and (IIRC) Catelyn. (I believe Jaime admitted the truth to Cat at some point during his captivity but I could be misremembering that.) Its likely that Cersei's other lovers strongly suspect the truth -- Lancel is scared witless at what Jaime will do to him -- but I doubt Cersei has actually confirmed those suspicions for any of them.</p>

<p>However, I would <em>speculate</em> that it's very likely that Tywin Lannister knows the truth by that point, for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stannis told everyone. Stannis's entire motivation for revolt in <em>Clash of Kings</em> is his sincere belief that Joffrey is not Robert's son, and he made sure everyone important knows it. Of course, even people who oppose the Lannisters have written this off as a political tactic, and Tywin certainly rejected Stannis's claim outright, but that doesn't mean he doesn't believe it.</li>
<li>Tywin is at least as intelligent as Ned Stark and Jon Arryn. If Ned could figure out the truth in a few months at Kings Landing, it seems likely that someone like Tywin would have been able to do so after almost a decade.</li>
<li>They had been caught before. When they were younger, a servant caught the two of them having sex, causing their mother to separate them. Its not known if she told Tywin about their actions (he would have been away acting as Hand at the time) or not, but its likely he would have suspected something was up in any case.</li>
<li>Tywin has seen her sometimes-irrational fixation on Jaime in action. Remember, she is the reason Jaime was brought to King's Landing and invested into the Kingsguard, which she orchestrated so she could be closer to him. In response, Tywin quit his post and took her with him back to Casterly Rock, since Cersei just robbed him of his heir.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, even if Tywin does know Joffrey's true parentage at the point he arrives in Kings Landing, there is <em>no way</em> he would ever speak about it openly, and I find it unlikely that we'll get a POV from him any time soon. So the best we can do is speculate, and my conclusion is basically: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As intelligent and practical as Tywin is, I find it hard to accept that, when confronted directly with the truth (via Stannis), he was unable to come to the correct conclusion.</p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","213228","<p>Ned only really lies about Jon's true parentage but he doesn't necessarily lie when he doesn't lie by refusing to tell Robert of his mother or letting Catelyn believe what she does.

"213235","Where is the logic in castrating fighters?","<p>This came up on another question, where in <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> (the books <em>Game of Thrones</em> is based on), the Unsullied have all of their genitalia removed, not just the penis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In Yunkai and Meereen, eunuchs are often made by removing a boy's testicles, but leaving the penis. Such a creature is infertile, yet often still capable of erection. Only trouble can come of this. We remove the penis as well, leaving nothing.

Is it not so?&quot;</p>
<p><sub>-- <em>A Storm of Swords</em>, chapter Daenerys II</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Removal of the penis makes sense in such a context, both to force obedience and to degrade the soldiers, but if you castrate a man then he loses most/all(?) of his ability to produce testosterone. Testosterone, being desirable for a soldier that relies on strength and fighting prowess, would be foolish to get rid of.</p>
<p>So for a (supposedly) elite army, why would it make sense to do so?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","213237","<p>The Unsullied are an analog of the Roman Legion.</p>

<p>Fully castrating the unsullied removed a major distraction, their upbringing/training forged them into perfect Legionnaires. They ignore wounds, hold the shield wall, and slowly and carefully wear down their attackers. They were made almost into automata, no humanity, no distractions.

<p>If you re-read the section where she initially treats him, she boils wine and pours it over the wound.  We have seen other maesters do the same thing in treating wounds (Pycelle does this when he attempts to treat Robert Baratheon's boar wound).  Additionally, we know that alcohol and heat both have antiseptic properties.  She stitches his wound closed with a silk thread.  She covers it with lambskin which doesn't personally seem the cleanest method of covering a wound to me, but it serves the same purpose as cotton (which I'm sure they didn't have), and some cultures have been known to use peat as an equivalent to cotton for wound dressings (which actually works better than cotton because it can absorb more than cotton, but it's not as pretty).  Then she instructs Drogo to avoid milk of the poppy (which I can only assume to be opium or an opium-like substance if we assume that plants in that world are roughly the same as plants in this world), and alcohol.  I don't exactly get why he should avoid a pain-killer, but <a href=""http://jdr.sagepub.com/content/89/3/219.abstract"">research</a> shows that alcohol consumption slows wound healing and increases the likelihood of infection (reasonable since we know that alcohol is a bloodthinner). So everything she has done and said up to this point indicate that she is truly trying to heal him.</p>

<p>This leaves only the question of the poultice that she put on him.  After he falls from his horse, she informs Dany that the poultice was made of firepod and sting-me-not.  I haven't run across any plants that are actually called this, so this is completely conjecture.  The poultice <em>could</em> have been the cause of Drogo's problems, but I'm guessing that a firepod is a chile pepper of some kind (and it would makes sense to call it ""firepod"" if it happens to be a red or orange pepper).  Capsaicin has antiseptic properties and would probably burn like hell if applied to a wound.  Sting-me-not sounds like a plant in the <em>Urtica</em> genus (stinging nettles and related) which also have antiseptic properties.</p>

<p>So...really, it seems like Drogo's death is caused by Drogo.  He removes the poultice and lambskin six days before he falls from his horse because he says it burns, and has it replaced with the soothing mud poultice placed there by the herbwomen--not by Mirri Maz Duur.  I don't know about you, but putting mud on a partially open wound is just nasty.  Mud is full of bacteria and other microorganisms.  It is not going to help the healing process.  He was also drinking fermented mare's milk (alcohol!) and had been taking milk of the poppy.  This probably dulled his senses and made him unaware of his declining health until it got to the point where he was too sick to know or care. Basically everything MMD said NOT to do, he did.</p>

<p>Alleras specifically says ""of noble birth"". To me this would imply that novices are accepted from any descent, noble or common. </p>

<hr>

<p>Even the founding of the Citadel is a bit of a mystery to modern Maesters. From <em>The World of Ice &amp; Fire</em> we find this excerpt in the ""Oldtown"" chapter.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The origins of the Citadel are almost as mysterious as those of the Hightower itself. Most credit its founding to the second son of Uthor of the High Tower, Prince Peremore the Twisted. A sickly boy, born with a withered arm and twisted back, Peremore was bedridden for much of his short life but had an insatiable curiosity about the world beyond his window, <strong>so he turned to wise men, teachers, priests, healers, and singers, along with a certain number of wizards, alchemists, and sorcerers.</strong> It is said the prince had no greater pleasure in life than listening to these scholars argue with one another. When Peremore died, his brother <strong>King Urrigon bequeathed a large tract of land beside the Honeywine to ""Peremore's pets,"" that they might establish themselves and continue teaching, learning, and questing after truth. And so they did.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems what were the original Maester, even though not that by name yet, were from all walks of life and from all different places. Which seems to be confirmed a few paragraphs later:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thousands of years before the first sept opened its doors, the city had been home to the Citadel, <strong>where boys and young men from all over Westeros came to study, learn, and forge their chains as maesters.</strong> No greater seat of knowledge exists anywhere in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While this does not explicting state whether the recruits are noble or common, I believe there is enough context to sumize that they were from both common and noble houses. </p>

<p>This also implies that the Citadel may not have had to do much ""recruiting"". It seems the Citadel was famous and respected enough that students would willingly seek out and come to join the order.</p>

<p>&quot;Two hundred years?&quot; said Meera.</p>
<p>The child smiled. &quot;Men, they are the children.&quot;<br><sub><strong>ADWD - BRAN II</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since she says she was born when Dragons ruled and has lived at least for 2 centuries, that will make her date of birth in King Jaehaerys I's reign. And needless to say, now we know at least some of them can live upto 2 centuries and perhaps more given how healthy and young Leaf looked at that time. Or we can simply say that their lifespans are much longer than ours and leave it at that.</p>
<p>As for reproduction, yes they certainly can albeit at a slower rate than humans. They don't just simply pop out of the ground. In the Dawn Age, there lived only the elder races in Westeros which were the Children and the Giants. Eventually, the First Men started pouring in from the land-bridge that connected Westeros to Essos. And with that migration, came the wars between the children and the First men. With the tide turning against them, the children turned to desperate weapons and used magic to smash the land bridge connecting the two continents, called the Arm of Dorne. But it was too little and too late since Thousands of First Men were already in Westeros and more importantly, Wives of the First Men bore children more faster than the females of the Elder races which skewed the balance further in favour of men until the children were forced to realise that they could not win this war.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of what we do believe of the Breaking comes to us through song and legend. The First Men crossed from Essos to Westeros by land, all agree, walking or riding across through the hills and forest of the great land bridge that connected the two continents in the Dawn Age. Dorne was the first land that they entered, but few remained, as we have chronicled; many and more pressed on northward, through the mountains and mayhaps across the salt marshes that once existed where the Sea of Dorne is now. As the centuries passed, they came in everincreasing numbers, claiming the stormlands and the Reach and the riverlands for their own, eventually reaching even the Vale and the North. They drove the elder races before them, slaughtering giants wherever they found them, hewing down weirwood trees with their bronze axes, making bloody war against the children of the forest.</p>
<p>The children fought back as best they could, but the First Men were larger and stronger. Riding their horses, clad and armed in bronze, the First Men overwhelmed the elder race wherever they met, for the weapons of the children were made of bone and wood and dragonglass. Finally, driven by desperation, the little people turned to sorcery and beseeched their greenseers to stem the tide of these invaders.</p>
<p>[.....]</p>
<p>Most scholars do agree that Essos and Westeros were once joined; a thousand tales and runic records tell of the crossing of the First Men. Today the seas divide them, so plainly some version of the event the Dornish call the Breaking must have occurred. Did it happen in the space of a single day, however, as the songs would have it? Was it the work of the children of the forest and the sorcery of their greenseers? These things are less certain.</p>
<p>[....]</p>
<p>No more wanderers crossed to Westeros after the Breaking, it is true, for the First Men were no seafarers...but so many of their forebears had already made the crossing that they outnumbered the dwindling elder races almost three to one by the time the lands were severed, and that disparity only grew in the centuries that followed, <strong>for the women of the First Men brought forth sons and daughters with much greater frequency than the females of the elder races. And thus the children and the giants faded, whilst the race of men spread and multiplied</strong> and claimed the fields and forests for their own, raising villages and forts and kingdoms. <br><sub><strong>TWOIAF - Dorne: The Breaking</strong></sub></p>

<li><p>He trusts Littlefinger, a man who he knows is still in love with his wife. Littlefinger himself warns Ned not to trust him.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Is he portrayed as being just as naive in the books, or was he worse in the TV series?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","7633","<p>Ned Stark was, as we can see, and as he himself says, not at all comfortable or accustomed to the intrigues of court life. He was raised in a position of power, and he operated in a position of power at King's Landing. I think he grossly overestimated that power, even though it boggles the mind that someone can be that naive. As a lord, I imagine he felt that people should respect him because of who he was, not because they had to.</p>

<p>His real mistake was not securing absolute military power. That was one of the first things we saw Tyrion do when he was Hand: Remove the old leader of the gold cloaks Janos Slynt and put his own man in his place. Ned did go to King's Landing with a force of Winterfell men, but he sent some away with Beric Dondarrion, and the remainder of his men were ambushed and killed, apparently because they were not exactly expecting trouble.</p>

<p>I believe that Littlefinger was somewhat honest about helping Ned, but he really had no choice, since putting Stannis on the throne would effectively have ended Littlefinger's career. Something else that Ned probably should have known.</p>

<p>Ned made a lot of hard choices, that were correct from an honourable point of view. But the real irony is that what brought him down was stepping out of that character and doing something not <em>quite</em> moral. If you recall the passage when Ned asks Littlefinger to secure the aid of the gold cloaks, you will notice that Ned finds this hard to ask, because bribing men to capture his best friends children and wife is not honourable, in his mind.</p>

"213431","Why were the Night's Watch required to be celibate?","<p>If the Night's Watch was supposed to last thousands of years, and was given land, why not have them raise families in the Gift and send all adult males to guard the wall on a rotation?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","213433","<h2>Because <em>love is the death of duty</em>.</h2>
<p>If they have families, they will lose the focus on the defense of the human realms against the Others. And when the time comes when they must choose, they will always choose their families rather than the realm. That is why they give up everything, to be completely focused on one duty.</p>
<p>Maester Aemon explained that part of the vow in detail in his conversation with Jon when it was suspected that Jon would desert for love of his family:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>Jon, did you ever wonder why the men of the Night’s Watch take no
wives and father no children?</strong>” Maester Aemon asked.</p>
<p>Jon shrugged. “No.” He scattered more meat. The fingers of his left
hand were slimy with blood, and his right throbbed from the weight of
the bucket.</p>
<p>“<strong>So they will not love,” the old man answered, “for love is the bane
of honor, the death of duty.</strong>”</p>
<p>That did not sound right to Jon, yet he said nothing. The maester was
a hundred years old, and a high officer of the Night’s Watch; it was
not his place to contradict him.</p>
<p>The old man seemed to sense his doubts. “Tell me, Jon, if the day
should ever come when your lord father must needs choose between honor
on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?&quot;</p>
<p>Jon hesitated. He wanted to say that Lord Eddard would never dishonor
himself, not even for love, yet inside a small sly voice whispered, He
fathered a bastard, where was the honor in that? And your mother, what
of his duty to her, he will not even say her name.</p>
<p>“He would do whatever was right,” he said... ringingly, to make up for
his hesitation. “No matter what.”</p>
<p>“Then Lord Eddard is a man in ten thousand. Most of us are not so
strong. <strong>What is honor compared to a woman’s love? What is duty against
the feel of a newborn son in your arms... or the memory of a brother’s
smile? Wind and words. Wind and words. We are only human, and the gods
have fashioned us for love. That is our great glory, and our great
tragedy.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The men who formed the Night’s Watch knew that only their courage
shielded the realm from the darkness to the north. They knew they must
have no divided loyalties to weaken their resolve. So they vowed they
would have no wives nor children.</strong> Yet brothers they had, and sisters.
Mothers who gave them birth, fathers who gave them names. They came
from a hundred quarrelsome kingdoms, and they knew times may change,
but men do not. So they pledged as well that the Night’s Watch would
take no part in the battles of the realms it guarded.</p>
<p>“They kept their pledge. When Aegon slew Black Harren and claimed his
kingdom, Harren’s brother was Lord Commander on the Wall, with ten
thousand swords to hand. He did not march. In the days when the Seven
Kingdoms were seven kingdoms, not a generation passed that three or
four of them were not at war. The Watch took no part. When the Andals
crossed the narrow sea and swept away the kingdoms of the First Men,
the sons of the fallen kings held true to their vows and remained at
their posts. So it has always been, for years beyond counting. Such is
the price of honor.</p>
<p><strong>A craven can be as brave as any man, when there is nothing to fear.
And we all do our duty, when there is no cost to it. How easy it seems
then, to walk the path of honor. Yet soon or late in every man’s life
comes a day when it is not easy, a day when he must choose.</strong>”<br><sub><strong>AGOT - Jon VIII</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great passage which really explains the two most troubling vows of the Black Brothers. First, the vow of celibacy. Second, the vow of neutrality. They must remain celibate for if they have wives and children, their loyalties shall be divided between safety of their loved ones or safety of the realm. And then neutrality because once again, the Black Brothers must not feel any divided loyalties between defense of their former homes and families and defense of the realm.</p>
<p>Until the day of choosing comes, every man is brave and honourable, every man keeps his vows. But that one day comes, as surely as the day he was born, when he must choose. Would he choose his sons? The love of his life? Or the people of the realm? Not every man is strong enough to choose the latter. So they must eliminate the complications to make the vows relatively easier for the Black brothers.</p>
<p>The Gift and the new Gift have in fact been inhabited by normal folks, normal families. And they are occasionally called to defense of the Wall when need be, like Jon called Mole's Town people to Castle Black when Thenns attacked. But they are not Black Brothers. When fight seems hopeless, their first priority will be their families, and they will flee. Just like the Mole Town folks did before Battle of the Wall. Even if we ignore that, if Black Brothers were allowed to own property, start families, the Watch would become eventually a Kingdom in itself, rather than the shield and defenders of all the Kingdoms. And that will sooner or later bring them in political conflict with their neighbouring Kingdoms. Even as things stand, many mad Lord commanders tried to make the watch hereditary, imagine what would happen if there were Houses, families and clans on the Wall as well. They must stand united, all the men of the seven Kingdoms, in defense of all the Kingdoms while staying out of their internal politics.</p>
<p>Jon experienced the truth of Maester Aemon's words despite harbouring doubts initially. When he fell in love with Ygritte, his duty started becoming harder and harder for him. But when the day of choosing came for him at Queenscrown, Jon chose duty and abandoned Ygritte, as much as it hurt him or haunts him still. And yet he failed in some ways again, when he spotted Ygritte while defending Castle Black, his hands won't release the arrow and thus he let Ygritte slip by, simply because he loved her. Who knows how many brothers of Night's Watch Ygritte killed before someone else shot her down?</p>

<h3>Robert's Dilemma</h3>
<p>When the War broke out, Following was the Breakdown of the forces:</p>
<p><strong>The Rebels:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>the North</li>
<li>the Vale</li>
<li>the Riverlands</li>
<li>the Stormlands</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Loyalists:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>The Crownlands</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Reach</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dorne</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, All of Robert's allies were up North. North, Vale and Riverlands shared borders with each other with only Riverlands sharing borders with Loyalist territories.</p>
<p>Stormlands alone were however surrounded by the Loyalists on every compass point. So Robert wanted to advance his forces north and link up with his allies before he could be trapped between the loyalist forces of Dorne, Reach and Crownlands. But he had to first deal with Storm Lords who were trying to rise up for the King.</p>
<p>Robert had won <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battles_at_Summerhall"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">victories at Summerhall</a> against those Lords and now had the complete support of Stormlands behind him. With home front secured, Robert advanced North-Westwards to link up with his allies; The Houses Tully, Arryn and Stark.</p>
<p>Naturally, to reach Riverlands, Robert had to either cross the Crownlands or the Reach. Robert chose to cross through the Reach and came upon the border town of Ashford. It is unclear if Robert tried to take Ashford castle before advancing to Riverlands but we know he was soon faced by Tyrells. Lord Mace had bestirred himself and Lord Randyll Tarly, known as finest soldier in the realm, had reached Ashford with his vanguard.</p>
<p>Tarly did not wait for main Tyrell Army to arrive and <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_Ashford"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">charged at the Stormlanders</a>. Stormlanders suffered losses and on arrival of main Tyrell Army, Robert was forced to withdraw to Riverlands. This is the only defeat Robert ever suffered.</p>
<p>That's how Robert reached Riverlands and the reason why further confrontations happened in that region as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Riverlands were the only point of entry into Rebel territory</li>
<li>Rebel leaders, the Lords Arryn, Stark, Tully and Baratheon were present in Riverlands.</li>
</ol>

<h3>How did Rhaegar reach Riverlands from Dorne?</h3>
<p>Rhaegar had gone to Dorne, that's correct.</p>
<p>However, the Loyalists suffered a very heavy defeat in <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_the_Bells"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Battle of the Bells</a>. That's when Rhaegar returned from Dorne and took command of the remnants of the Royal Armies, regrouped and reinforced.</p>
<p>From <em>ASOS: Jaime V</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He floated in heat, in memory. &quot;<strong>After dancing griffins lost the
Battle of the Bells</strong>, Aerys exiled him.&quot; Why am I telling this absurd
ugly child? &quot;He had finally realized that Robert was no mere outlaw
lord to be crushed at whim, but the greatest threat House Targaryen
had faced since Daemon Blackfyre. The king reminded Lewyn Martell
gracelessly that he held Elia and sent him to take <strong>command of the
ten thousand Dornishmen coming up the kingsroad</strong>. <strong>Jon Darry and
Barristan Selmy rode to Stoney Sept to rally what they could of
griffins' men</strong>, and <strong>Prince Rhaegar returned from the south</strong> and
persuaded his father to swallow his pride and summon my father.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then marched towards North and tried to cross the River trident.</p>
<p>Rebels decided to stop the advance of the Prince at River Trident because given the terrain of Riverlands (All plains and rivers) that was the nearest defensible position against the Advancing Royal Armies. A battle ensued which decided the fate of Targaryen monarchy and the Crown Prince was killed.</p>

Like Ramsay Snow who took the name of his father, Bolton.</p>

<p>After readig this question - <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/53297/benefits-of-joining-the-nights-watch"">Benefits of joining The Night&#39;s Watch</a> - I think that as he is not the oldest boy of his siblings and a bastard, why didn't he have a lower career like a member of the Night's Watch?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><laws>","146135","<p>Well first of all, this is a very intriguing question which has bugged me a lot personally.</p>
<h3>Daemon's background and descent</h3>
<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daemon_I_Blackfyre"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Daemon</a> was a bastard but he was a Targaryen on both sides, having <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon_IV_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Aegon IV</a> as his father and Princess <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daena_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Daena the defiant</a> as his mother. So that makes it all the more interesting. Why chose the new name? It must be noted that Daena was heir of her brother King <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Baelor_I_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Baelor</a> but her claim was ruled out by Lords of the realm who made her uncle Prince <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Viserys_II_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Viserys</a> the King. If it had been Daena who was crowned instead of Viserys, Daemon would have been first in line to throne after getting legitimized by his mother.</p>
<h3>Aegon's paranoia</h3>
<p>He was however, not the eldest born son of the King, natural or legitimate. <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daeron_II_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Daeron II</a> was the eldest and legitimate child of Aegon IV.</p>
<p>King Aegon however suspected that Daeron was not his son at all. He had always known that his sister-wife <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Naerys_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Naerys</a> and his brother <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aemon_Targaryen_(son_of_Viserys_II)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Aemon</a> (The Dragonknight) were too close to each other. Even when Aegon and Naerys wed, Aemon had a physical brawl with Aegon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>She loved Aemon best of her brothers</strong>, for he knew how to make her laugh—and he had something of the same piety that she possessed, while
Aegon did not. She loved the Seven as dearly as she loved her brother,
if not more so, and might have been a septa if her lord father had
allowed it. But he did not, and Viserys instead wed her to his son
Aegon in 153 AC, with King Aegon III's blessing. The singers say that
<strong>Aemon and Naerys both wept during the ceremony</strong>, though the histories tell us <strong>Aemon quarreled with Aegon at the wedding feast,
and that Naerys wept during the bedding rather than the
wedding</strong>.<br><sub><em><strong>The World of Ice and Fire: Targaryen Kings-Viserys
II</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The resentment only grew when Aegon started torturing Naerys and humiliating Aemon as his revenge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matters between them were inflamed further by Prince Aemon, their
brother, who had been inseparable from Naerys when they were young.
Aegon's resentment of his noble, celebrated brother was plain to all,
for the <strong>king delighted in slighting Aemon and Naerys both at every
turn</strong>. Even after the Dragonknight died in his defense, and Queen
Naerys perished in childbed the year after, Aegon IV did little to
honor their memory.<br><sub><em><strong>The World of Ice and Fire: Targaryen
Kings-Aegon IV</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given his petty nature, he bestowed the ancestral Targaryen sword on Daemon instead of Daeron. Some people, like Prince <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Maekar_I_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Maekar</a>, Argued that it was only because Daemon was a puissant warrior while Daeron had a bookish non-martial nature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;My father (then-Prince-and-later-King Maekar) says that was because Daemon was a
swordsman, and Daeron never was,&quot; said Egg (then-Prince-and-later-King Aegon V). &quot;Why give a
horse to a man who cannot ride? The sword was not the kingdom, he
says.&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>The Sworn Sword</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later on, he started suspecting that Daeron was actually a bastard of Naerys and Aemon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The king's quarrels with his close kin became all the worse after his
son Daeron grew old enough to voice his opinions. Kaeth's Lives of
Four Kings makes it plain that <strong>the false accusations of the queen's
adultery made by Ser Morgil Hastwyck were instigated by the king
himself</strong>, though at the time Aegon denied it. These claims were
disproved by Ser Morgil's death in a trial by combat against the
Dragonknight. That <strong>these accusations came at the same time as Aegon
and Prince Daeron were quarreling over the king's plans to launch an
unprovoked war against Dorne was surely no coincidence</strong>. It was also
the first (but not the last) time that Aegon threatened to name one of
his bastards as his heir instead of Daeron.
<strong>After the deaths of his siblings, the king began to make barely veiled references to his son's alleged illegitimacy</strong>—something he
dared only because the Dragonknight was dead. His courtiers and
hangers-on aped the king, and this calumny spread.<br><sub><em><strong>The
World of Ice and Fire: Targaryen Kings-Aegon IV</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3>So why wasn't Daemon sent to the Night's Watch?</h3>
<p>As King Aegon allegedly wanted to remove Daeron as his successor and name Daemon instead, Daemon was not sent to the Night's Watch. Aegon however never actually took any steps in this regard given the marital alliance Daeron had with the Dornish and popularity of the Prince among many lords.</p>
<p>Younger Targaryens have never taken the black in history except Maester Aemon<sup>1</sup>. They usually:</p>

<hr />
<h3>Daemon's Legitimization</h3>
<p>It must be noted that Daemon had adopted the name Blackfyre before his actual legitimization.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Daemon was the name Daena gave to this child, for Prince Daemon had
been the wonder and the terror of his age, and in later days that was
seen as a warning of what the boy would become. <strong>Daemon Waters was
his full name when he was born in 170 AC</strong>. At that time, Daena
refused to name the father, but even then Aegon's involvement was
suspected. Raised at the Red Keep, this handsome youth was given the
instruction of the wisest maesters and the best masters-at-arms at
court, including Ser Quentyn Ball, the fiery knight called Fireball.
He loved nothing better than deeds of arms and excelled at them, and
many saw in him a warrior who would one day be another Dragonknight.
King Aegon <strong>knighted Daemon in his twelfth year</strong> when he won a squires'
tourney (thereby making him the youngest knight ever made in the time
of the Targaryens, surpassing Maegor I) and shocked his court, kin,
and council by <strong>bestowing upon him the sword of Aegon the Conqueror,
Blackfyre, as well as lands and other honors. Daemon took the name
Blackfyre thereafter</strong>.<br><sub><strong><em>The World of Ice and Fire</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice, Daemon is granted Lands at 12 in 182 AC (Given that he was born in 170 AC) by his father and takes the name Blackfyre. He was not legitimized back then therefore legally not allowed to use the name Targaryen, so that way he founded a bastard Cadet dynasty.</p>
<p>Aegon IV died in 184 AC, that's when he legitimized his children including Daemon. So Daemon wasn't a legal member of House Targaryen for two years while he had his own dynasty and name. Afterwards, he never gave up his own dynasty name in favor of Targaryen name.</p>
<h3>Cadet Dynasties</h3>
<p>He decided to found a cadet dynasty of House Targaryen, fully aware that he or his descendants were not in the line of succession given that Daeron was young and later went on to have sons and grandsons of his own.</p>
<p>This is not unheard of. We have seen how even the legitimate younger sons of noble houses have founded cadet dynasties. E.g. The <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Karstark"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Karstarks</a> and <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Greystark"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Greystarks</a> are cadet dynasties of House Starks, founded by younger legitimate sons.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Karstarks traced their descent to Karlon Stark, a younger son of Winterfell</strong> who had put down a rebel lord a thousand years ago, and
been granted lands for his valor. The castle he built had been named
Karl's Hold, but that soon became Karhold, and over the centuries the
Karhold Starks had become Karstarks.<br><sub><strong><em>A Storm of Swords:
Catelyn III</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ser Bartimus had no interest in the world outside, or indeed anything
that had happened since he lost his leg to a riderless horse and a
maester's saw. He had come to love the Wolf's Den, however, and liked
nothing more than to talk about its long and bloody history. The Den
was much older than White Harbor, the knight told Davos. It had been
raised by King Jon Stark to defend the mouth of the White Knife
against raiders from the sea. <strong>Many a younger son of the King in the
North had made his seat there</strong>, many a brother, many an uncle, many a
cousin. Some passed the castle to their own sons and grandsons, and
<strong>offshoot branches of House Stark had arisen; the Greystarks had lasted the longest</strong>, holding the Wolf's Den for five centuries, until
they presumed to join the Dreadfort in rebellion against the Starks of
Winterfell.<br><sub><strong><em>A Dance with Dragons: Davos IV</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if even Legitimate aristocrats can found their own dynasties separate from the parent sense, it should not be very shocking that a  bastard decided to do the same.</p>
<p>Not to mention, Daemon had to do it anyways because he held lands from his father despite being a bastard and a Lord needs a dynasty name.</p>
<h3>Daemon's personality</h3>
<p>Daemon was by all accounts a proud man. Being founder of a Dynasty is something that would attract that kind of man when the alternative was being a younger and minor member of a centuries old dynasty.</p>
<p>That also made him unique among his other siblings and set him apart from others while boasting of the pride that they held the sword.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Political Motives</h3>
<p>There have to be some political motives as well. People knew that Daemon wielded the sword of the Targaryen Kings. If Daemon had taken the Targaryen name, he would have just been a younger Targaryen wielding an ancestral sword like his half-brother, Brynden Bloodraven wielded Queen Visenya's sword, the Darksister.</p>
<p>By choosing the name Blackfyre, he emphasized the fact it was him who bore the sword of the Kings in mind of anyone who heard that name. In this way he separated himself from both Brynden and Daeron, putting himself on the political map as a possible claimant to the throne. He reminded everyone by using that name that it was he who held his father's favor and he who wields the conqueror's sword.</p>
<p>However it must be noted that Daemon did not want to be the King initially. It is said that it was his half brother Aegor mainly along with other dissident lords who changed his mind.</p>
<hr />
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>In conclusion, It is clear that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Daemon had already taken the name <em>Blackfyre</em> and founded a cadet dynasty of House Targaryen, two years before he was actually legitimized.</li>
<li>Daemon wasn't sent to NW as his father wished for him to succeed him allegedly. Besides Targaryen Royals didn't usually join the NW. A notable exception here, as pointed out by Bebs is, Bloodraven. But then again Bloodraven was offered a choice between the axe or NW so perhaps it doesn't count.</li>
<li>Daemon wanted people to remember that It was he who was given the ancestral sword of Targaryen Kings by his father rather than Daeron. That's why he did not abandon his new name after even being legitimized.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p><sub><strong>1.</strong> Aemon did not initially join the NW either. He joined the Citadel. He only went to NW out of his own accord to avoid being used against his brother Aegon </sub></p>

"213703","Whatever happened to Nettles and Sheepstealer?","<p>Looking at <a href=""https://youtu.be/WY_GyBuuf_c"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the Histories &amp; Lore video on ""The Dance of Dragons""</a>, had me wondering - do we know at all what happened after to Nettles, after she fled on her dragon Sheepstealer?</p>

<p>The history of Westeros video and the wiki don't seem to offer any answers - but then, I've not read the actual books or seen the full series: and so am wondering, if the actual text itself might have provided any answers or even just <em>clues</em> on the ""what happened next"" with this duo?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","213766","<p>The show itself only gives the detail we see in that video which is, as you state, unfortunately short but can be expected from a 20 minute overview. As far as I am aware none of the other Histories &amp; Lore videos mention the pair.</p>

<p><strong>Oberyn Martell:</strong> Rhaenyra now mistrusted all the dragonseeds, including the girl who rode with her husband Daemon, hunting Aemond in the Riverlands. She ordered the girl's head be sent to her. But there was a complication; as well as her dragon, the girl had taken to riding Daemon. When Daemon received the queen's order, he proclaimed it a queen's words and a whore's work. He sent the girl away at dawn, watching her and her dragon vanish into the morning mists.</p>
<p><sub><em>Game of Thrones</em>, Season 5 Histories &amp; Lore, &quot;The Dance of Dragons&quot;</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The books themselves didn't give too much detail on this and only hinted at legends until <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em> came along which gives us more insight into what <em>could</em> have happened to them. The initial account of what happened is similar to what the show gives us.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How the prince and his bastard girl spent their last night beneath Lord Mooton’s roof is not recorded, but as dawn broke they appeared together in the yard, and Prince Daemon helped Nettles saddle Sheepstealer one last time. It was her custom to feed him each day before she flew; dragons bend easier to their rider’s will when full. That morning she fed him a black ram, the largest in all Maidenpool, slitting the ram’s throat herself. Her riding leathers were stained with blood when she mounted her dragon, Maester Norren records, and “her cheeks were stained with tears.” No word of farewell was spoken betwixt man and maid, but as Sheepstealer beat his leathery brown wings and climbed into the dawn sky, Caraxes raised his head and gave a scream that shattered every window in Jonquil’s Tower. High above the town, Nettles turned her dragon toward the Bay of Crabs, and vanished in the morning mists, never to be seen again at court or castle.</p>
<p><sub><em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, The Dying of the Dragons: Rhaenyra Triumphant</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are some accounts that when Daemon fell above the Gods Eye he survived and managed to make his way back to Nettles. However, Archmaester Gyldayn remarks that this is probably false and more of a <em>&quot;charming song&quot;</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That Prince Daemon died as well we cannot doubt. His remains were never found, but there are queer currents in that lake, and hungry fish as well. The singers tell us that the old prince survived the fall and afterward made his way back to the girl Nettles, to spend the remainder of his days at her side. Such stories make for charming songs, but poor history. Even Mushroom gives the tale no credence, nor shall we.</p>
<p><sub><em>Fire &amp; Blood</em>, The Dying of the Dragons: Rhaenyra Triumphant</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is believed that Sheepstealer and Nettles may have made their way to Crackclaw Point or the Mountains of the Moon. However, the last known sighting of the pair was in a cave in the Vale of Arryn when Ser Robert Rowan's men fought the pair briefly suffering heavy losses. Nettles and Sheepstealer were seen fleeing deeper in the Mountains of the Moon.  The wildlings of the mountains also tell tales of the &quot;fire-witch&quot; within but these may or may not be accurate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>High in the mountains, the unthinkable happened one night as Lord Robert and his men huddled about their campfires. In the slopes above, a cave mouth was visible from the road, and a dozen men climbed up to see if it might offer them shelter from the wind. The bones scattered about the mouth of the cave might have given them pause, yet they pressed on…and roused a dragon.</p>
<p>Sixteen men perished in the fight that followed, and threescore more suffered burns before the angry brown wyrm took wing and fled deeper into the mountains with “a ragged woman clinging to its back.” That was the last known sighting of Sheepstealer and his rider, Nettles, recorded in the annals of Westeros…though the wildlings of the mountains still tell tales of a “fire witch” who once dwelled in a hidden vale far from any road or village. One of the most savage of the mountain clan came to worship her, the storytellers say; youths would prove their courage by bringing gifts to her, and were only accounted men when they returned with burns to show that they had faced the dragon woman in her lair.</p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><jon-snow>","73772","<p>""Suspect"" is a strong word. We do not know what anyone, except the POV characters, suspect. We can only suspect, or assume that they suspect, unless they voice their suspicions. People might very well suspect things about Ned's bastard son. But the story of his breach of honour in bringing a bastard child home from the war was no doubt an appealing story for people: Why would he say such a thing unless it was true?</p>

<p>We know that he sacrificed his own honour to protect Lyannna's son. Much like Robb chose to sacrifice his own honour to protect the honour of the woman he married, Jeyne Westerling. But to the common man, it would be a plausible story that an honourable man brings home his bastard and raises him with his trueborn children. </p>

<p>However, GRRM's official ""cover story"", as I have always understood it, is what Littlefinger says to Sansa: <em>It is rude to pry into people's bastards.</em> It is described in this conversation between him and Sansa, when they decide on the best cover story for Sansa when she comes to the Eyrie.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Sansa) ""Couldn't I be the trueborn daughter of some knight in your service?
  Perhaps he died gallantly in the battle, and...""</p>
  
  <p>(Littlefinger) ""I have no gallant knights in my service, Alayne. Such a tale would
  draw unwanted questions as a corpse draws crows. It is rude to pry
  into the origins of a man's natural children, however.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for why no one would 1) wonder <em>how</em> Lyanna died, 2) connect it with Ned bringing home an infant son, which seems a pretty obvious connection to make, from our perspective, one has to take into account that this was war. Momentous events took place, the Targaryen dynasty fell, many great lords died or were exiled, many knights were killed, many ""war babies"" were no doubt born. Not all people are as inquisitive as someone like, for example, Littlefinger or Lord Varys.</p>

<p>And also, of course, it fits the story much better this way. :)</p>

There probably weren't nine actors in Kingsguard outfits when the scene was filmed, as all nine are never in the camera frame at the same time. More likely, different takes of the same scene positioned the Kingsguard members differently, then mismatched the shots in the editing process.</p>

They chose the Black. Their sworn brother Ser <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Harrold_Langward"" rel=""noreferrer"">Harrold Langward</a> was accused of the same charges but he chose to demand a trial by combat instead and was slain as a result.</li>
<li>Ser <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lucamore_Strong"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lucamore Strong</a> broke his vows of chastity by secretly taking three wives and siring a multitude of children.

<li>Ser <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Gyles_Belgrave"" rel=""noreferrer"">Gyles Belgrave</a> was accused of either directly or indirectly poisoning his King Aegon II.

<li>Lord Commander Ser <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Marston_Waters"" rel=""noreferrer"">Marston Waters</a> did kind of betray his King by executing a coup although circumstances are unclear. On pretext of the rising influence of Prince Viserys' Lyseni in-laws with help of the hand Thaddeus Rowan, the Lord Commander of the KG took control of Aegon's Hill in Aegon III's name (The King was a minor) and moved to arrest Aegon's sister-in-law Larra Rogare and her family. The King and his brother refused to give Lady Larra up and closed the gates of Maegor's Holdfast. Though Marston did lay a secret siege to Maegor's Holdfast while his King and the royal family suffered inside without food or water for 18 days, he refused to order his men to attack the King he had sworn to protect, he instead chose to beg the King to open the doors and to reason with him. And when Prince Viserys unraveled the wider conspiracy, King Aegon ordered Marston to prove his professed loyalty by arresting the real culprits. True to his oath, he obeyed the orders to arrest the men who had apparently fooled him. During one such arrest, he was murdered by his own sworn brother Ser Mervyn Flowers. To this day, it is debated whether Marston was in on the conspiracy and turned on his fellow conspirators once he saw the plan failing or was the simple Knight used by politicians (Former hand Lord Unwin Peake was chief suspect) for their own ends.</li>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","213917","<h3>Almost certainly not and I can find no cases of it ever happening</h3>
<p>There are no recorded cases that I can find of a Night's Watch brother being released from their oaths and joining the Kingsguard. In fact I can't really think of a case of a sworn brother being released from their oath. We have Jon Snow but he pulled the whole loophole trick in the show and we're yet to see what happens in the books so we can discount that. However, Stannis does offer to legitimise him and free him from the oath, though it is not clear if he actually <em>can</em> do that or is doing it because he has the army and power to enforce it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;As you wish. But consider quickly. I am not a patient man, as your black brothers are about to discover.&quot; Stannis put a thin, fleshless hand on Jon's shoulder. &quot;Say nothing of what we've discussed here today. To anyone. But when you return, you need only bend your knee, lay your sword at my feet, and pledge yourself to my service, and you shall rise again as Jon Stark, the Lord of Winterfell.&quot;</p>
<p><sub><em>A Storm of Swords</em>, Jon XI</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only known case of someone else being released from the oath is Samwell Tarly at the end of Season 8 but it happens off screen. We can assume the new King released him so it would appear that kings <em>can</em> do this but usually don't as the men of the Watch are usually less than stellar. Sam is also made Archmaester so this <em>might</em> have something to do with it as well.</p>
<p>The oath explicitly states <em>&quot;I shall live and die at my post.&quot;</em> and so would make it clear that one cannot simply leave, as we see deserters are executed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact the Kingsguard oath was modelled on the Night's Watch one and so it would appear whilst they have common elements they probably conflict as Kingsguard members serve for life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was Visenya, not Aegon, who decided the nature of the Kingsguard. Seven champions for the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, who would all be knights. She modeled their vows upon those of the Night's Watch, so that they would forfeit all things save their duty to the king.</p>
<p><sub><em>The World of Ice and Fire</em>, The Targaryen Kings: Aegon I</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lastly, it is worth noting of those Kingsguard that were sent to the Night's Watch most had lost their king and broke the oath by betraying said king. And the odd one out broke the oath by fathering children. Breaking the Night's Watch oath results in death not being released from it to join a more prestigious organisation.</p>

"146311","Why didn't anyone notice that stocks of Wildfire were very low?","<p>Unmarked spoilers for those who have not read ASOS and ACOK. Proceed at your own risk.</p>
<h3>The review of inherited assets by the Rebels</h3>
<p>In <em>AGOT: Eddard IV</em> we see:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The Crown is more than six million gold pieces in debt, Lord Stark.
The Lannisters are the biggest part of it, but we have also borrowed
from Lord Tyrell, the Iron Bank of Braavos, and several Tyroshi
trading cartels. Of late I've had to turn to the Faith. The High
Septon haggles worse than a Dornish fishmonger.&quot;</p>
<p>Ned was aghast. &quot;<strong>Aerys Targaryen left a treasury flowing with
gold</strong>. How could you let this happen?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This implies that after the victory in Robert's Rebellion, the leaders took a full measure of what did the former Monarch leave in inheritance e.g. monetary assets. They must have also taken a review of the state of defensive assets like wildfire reserves, the pride of Aerys Targaryen.</p>
<h3>Unexpected discoveries of Wildfire caches</h3>
<p>We know that afterwards, the unexpected discoveries of hidden wildfire caches were kind of a normal thing in KL.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;No, no,&quot; Hallyne squeaked, &quot;the sums are accurate, I swear. We have
been, hmmm, most fortunate, my lord Hand. <strong>Another cache of Lord
Rossart's was found</strong>, more than three hundred jars. Under the
Dragonpit! Some whores have been using the ruins to entertain their
patrons, and one of them fell through a patch of rotted floor into a
cellar. When he felt the jars, he mistook them for wine. He was so
drunk he broke the seal and drank some.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There was a prince who tried that once,&quot; said Tyrion dryly. &quot;I
haven't seen any dragons rising over the city, so it would seem it
didn't work this time either.&quot; The Dragonpit atop the hill of Rhaenys
had been abandoned for a century and a half. <strong>He supposed it was as
good a place as any to store wildfire, and better than most, but it
would have been nice if the late Lord Rossart had told someone.</strong>
&quot;Three hundred jars, you say? That still does not account for these
totals. You are several thousand jars ahead of the best estimate you
gave me when last we met.&quot;<br><sub><strong><em>A Clash of Kings: Tyrion
XI</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that Hallyne says <strong>another</strong> cache has been found which means there must have been previous such discoveries as well. Tyrion however doesn't suspect any foulplay and seems to think that it was merely there for storage purposes.</p>
<h3>The Magnitude of the effort</h3>
<p>Then we observe:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So His Grace commanded his alchemists to place caches of wildfire all
over King's Landing. <strong>Beneath Baelor's Sept and the hovels of Flea
Bottom, under stables and storehouses, at all seven gates, even in the
cellars of the Red Keep itself</strong>.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything was done in the utmost secrecy by a handful of master
pyromancers. They did not even trust their own acolytes to help. The
queen's eyes had been closed for years, and Rhaegar was busy
marshaling an army. But Aerys's new mace-and-dagger Hand was not
utterly stupid, and with <strong>Rossart, Belis, and Garigus coming and
going night and day</strong>, he became suspicious.<br><sub><strong><em>A Storm of Swords: Jaime V</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This shows the magnitude of the effort. A lot of wildfire must have been needed to see this accomplished and a lot of days as well, given how much the King was visited by the pyromancers during all this time.</p>
<p>So evidently, the stockpile of wildfire must have dropped to a very low level.</p>
<h3>The Question</h3>
<p>Yet after the Rebels took the city, none of the rebel leaders thought while naturally taking a review of the assets of the monarchy <em>&quot;Hey, that's weird. Aerys was notoriously obsessed with wildfire, showed remarkable favor to the Pyromancers so there must have been plenty of that in the stores. The Mad King left plenty of gold so he could afford it, right? No wildfire was used against us and yet there's not enough in the stock pile. Where did it all go?&quot;</em></p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WB9CG.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WB9CG.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>Then in eventual accidental discoveries of the hidden caches, no one seemed to suspect something fishy going on.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0M0ne.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0M0ne.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>They should have been suspicious about the status of wildfire stocks just by reviewing the numbers and books in the aftermath of the Rebellion's success. The Pyromancers kept tallies after all as evident from when Hallyne visited Tyrion. They couldn't have possibly destroyed all records — that alone would have been very suspicious — while keeping the records would have given away that a lot of wildire pots were missing. Yet the Rebels weren't suspicious at all. Why was that?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","146322","<p>Hallyne tells Tyrion this earlier, in Tyrion V of ACOK:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Oh, but it does,” said Hallyne. “There is a vault below this one where we store the older pots. Those from King Aerys‟s day. It was his fancy to have the jars made in the shapes of fruits. Very perilous fruits indeed, my lord Hand, and, hmmm, riper now than ever, if you take my meaning. We have sealed them with wax and pumped the lower vault full of water, but even so . . . by rights they ought to have been destroyed, but <strong>so many of our masters were murdered during the Sack of King‟s Landing, the few acolytes who remained were unequal to the task. And much of the stock we made for Aerys was lost.</strong> Only last year, two hundred jars were discovered in a storeroom beneath the Great Sept of Baelor. No one could recall how they came there, but I‟m sure I do not need to tell you that the High Septon was beside himself with terror.</p>
  
  <hr>
  
  <p>“This morning the Wisdom Munciter told me that we had seven thousand eight hundred and forty. That count includes four thousand jars from King Aerys‟s day, to be sure.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hallyne says that it was their opinion that under Aerys II they had too much wildfire (saying they ought to have destroyed it).  But then, most of them were lost since the masters who knew where they were had been murdered in the Sack of King's Landing.  The remaining masters were all young and just made masters; they probably didn't know about Aerys's jars.  The masters who did know where they were knew that they'd lost them, but thought it was all for the better.</p>

<p>So the older masters did notice, they simply didn't care.  From the second quote we see that Aerys's jars made only about half of their stocks; without those they had plenty of wildfire.</p>

<p>Even the 3,840 jars not made by Aerys is a LOT of wildfire.  Robert would think this is more wildfire than normal; and he would be occupied with governing the Seven Kingdoms.</p>

"146325","Has Brienne really seen Dunk's shield?","<p>In <em>A Feast for Crows</em> Brienne remembers seeing a shield described like the shield Tanselle painted for Duncan in <em>The Hedge Knight</em>.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iPhqj.png"" width=""200""></p>

<p>But later, in <em>The Mystery Knight</em>, Dunk recalls that <strong>his former shield has been crushed in a fight</strong>, and now he has a shield with another painting that gives him the name ""The Gallows Knight"".</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZY4Kl.png"" width=""200""></p>

<p>How can the first shield end up in Lord Selwyn Tarth’s armory if it has been destroyed in a fight?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","146333","<p>It most probably isn't the same shield. </p>

<p>You are correct the original shield was destroyed beyond repair. </p>

<p>Dunk just bought the gallows shield in Stoney Sept because he was getting a good deal for it. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dunk limiting his shield and slipped it onto his arm. It was an old
  thing, tall and heavy, kite-shaped, made of pine and rimmed with iron.
  <strong>He had bought it in Stoney Sept to replace the shield the Longinch
  had hacked to splinters when they fought. Dunk had not had time to
  have it painted with his elm and shooting star</strong>, so it still bore the
  arms of its last owner: a hanged man swinging grim and gray beneath a
  gallows tree. It was not a sigil that he would have chosen for
  himself, but <strong>the shield had come cheap</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As evident, it was only painted in the way it was at the time of purchase because Duncan didn't have the time to get it repainted with his own sigil. </p>

<p>He said so much later as well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Every robber knight I've ever hanged has said the same. Your device
  may be prophetic, ser…if ser you are. A gallows and a hanged man.
  These are your arms?""</p>
  
  <p><strong>""No, m'lord. I need to have the shield repainted.""</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Dunk must have gotten his shield replaced/repainted at any time between his adventures in Mystery Knight to the point he became Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. By Law, every knight must have his own sigil which can be carried on only by his legitimate sons. So Duncan couldn't have used that gallows sigil longer than required. From <em>The Hedge Knight</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The prince nodded at the battered shield Dunk carried, and the winged
  chalice upon its face. ""<strong>By law, only a trueborn son is entitled to
  inherit a knight's arms. You must needs find a new device, ser, a
  sigil of your own</strong>.""</p>

"74244","Is Cersei's Penance Walk partly inspired by the short story the Emperor's New Clothes?","<p>While I heard that Cersei's penance walk is loosely inspired by the penance walk of Jane Shore (which is a real event), the first thing that came to mind regarding the penance walk is the story from Hans Christian Andersen's short story that shows the emperor showing off his new ""clothes"" to the people when he is actually naked. </p>

<p>Is it more of a coincidence that Cersei's penance walk is similar to the emperor's walk in the short story?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","74281","<p>Public penance was fairly common in Medieval Europe. As it says <a href=""http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/dictionary/index.cfm?id=35905"">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The practice of requiring penitents to give public satisfaction for
  their sins as a condition for absolution and reconciliation with the
  Church. In vogue up to the early Middle Ages, public penance could be
  either solemn or not, depending on the gravity of the offense and the
  amount of scandal given.</p>
  
  <p>When public penance was also solemn, the reason had to be a grave one.
  Among the public crimes that might be subject to solemn penance, the
  most common were adultery, apostasy, fornication, and murder,
  including abortion. A historic example of public penance was Henry
  II's walking barefoot in 1174 to the shrine of St. Thomas of Bucket,
  to expiate his part in the murder of the archbishop. The more common
  practice was to limit solemn penance to those crimes that gave such
  scandal as seemed to call for proportionate expiation.</p>
  
  <p>More generally, public penance was not solemn. The person would
  secretly confess some grave sin from which he was absolved by a
  priest. His satisfaction would be an external penance from which
  others might conclude the nature of the sin, but there was no formal
  identification as a public sinner.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This real historical practice was almost certainly the inspiration for Cersei Lannister's ""Walk of Shame"". Since the point of the ""Emperor's New Clothes"" story was more about ""Speaking Truth to Power"", I doubt it has any connection here. I can kinda see what the OP is asking about though; certainly the ""Emperor"" ended up being publicly shamed, although that wasn't the moral of the story. There's also Lady Godiva's ride, but that was about her purposely shaming her husband into doing something (reducing taxes, IIRC). But neither of these really fits Cersei's <em>officially mandated punishment</em>.</p>

"214234","Why did Robert pick unworthy men for the White Cloaks?","<p>When we look at past examples, Kingsguards' history for most part has been illustrious and a shining example of chivalry and honour. There have been rare exceptions every two or three decades or so but that doesn't match up to what happened in Robert's reign. </p>

<p>Robert's Seven could perhaps be called the worst seven ever assembled in the history. Even staunch Baratheon loyalists like Eddard Stark agreed on that much. When we look at the 7:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ser Barristan Selmy - Although famous in the seven Kingdoms for his honour, Selmy had indeed dishonoured himself by taking Robert's pardon rather than dying for Targaryens like his sworn brothers did. As his Lord Commander and comrades said, ""Our knees don't bend easy [....] Kingsguards do not flee [...] We swore an oath"". Yet Selmy didn't follow them in their example even though he was arguably made of the same stuff; True Steel. </li>
<li>Ser Jaime Lannister - The worst Kingsguard ever on face-value. He slew his King and took Robert's pardon, just like Selmy. </li>
<li>Ser Arys Oakheart - Although well-meaning and not without some honour, he was weak-willed and we often see him dishonouring himself, although at least he shows some resistance to evil. And then we see how he sold Princess Myrcella to Dornish serpants for some sweet nothings whispered in his ear in a fashion that would have enraged old Ser Gerold Hightower or Prince Aemon the Dragonknight. </li>
<li>Ser Boros Blount - A well known coward with little to no martial skills who was dishonourable beside. Even Ser Arys didn't shame himself as much as Boros did in his yielding of Prince Tommen. </li>
<li>Ser Mandon Moore - Although a most puissant knight, he was known to be a bit psychotic, robotic and dishonourable as we see him in the affair of Joff ordering KG to beat Sansa up. Ser Arys at least objected before hitting her, Mandon Moore needed no pressure at all. </li>
<li>Ser Meryn Trant - A cruel, dishonourable man who was a stain on the White Cloak he wore. </li>
<li>Ser Preston Greenfield - Seems to be somewhat gifted with the sword but characterwise he was not much different from other paragons such as Blount, Moore and Trant. </li>
</ol>

<p>Among the seven, the only real steel were the two surviving member of Aerys II's seven. The five that Robert himself chose were singularly unsuited for the job. How did Robert have such a knack for picking the worst possible aspiring white cloaks? Is there any background information or author's comments available on those appointment? </p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","214235","<h2>Because Robert Baratheon was not a good king.</h2>
<p>Many characters repeatedly emphasize that Robert Baratheon, while a mighty warrior and a worthy knight in his prime, did not have the judgment, skill or temperament to make a good king.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Robert was never the same after he put on that crown. Some men are like swords, made for fighting. Hang them up and they go to rust.</p>
<p><sub>A Clash of Kings, ch. 6</sub></p>
<p>He was a good knight but a bad king, for he had no right to the throne he sat.</p>
<p><sub>A Dance with Dragons, ch. 11</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even Robert himself did not feel that he was qualified for the task, and he spent much of his time getting drunk, sleeping around, and reminiscing about his glory days.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I swear to you, I was never so alive as when I was winning this throne, or so dead as now that I've won it.</p>
<p><sub> A Game of Thrones, ch. 30</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because Robert was so unhappy doing the work of the king he allowed his advisors and his wife to influence many of his decisions, leading to several appointments to the Kingsguard that were for their loyalty to third parties rather than their worth. Varys explicitly notes as much to Eddard Stark.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ser Boros and Ser Meryn are the queen’s creatures to the bone, and I have deep suspicions of the others. No, my lord, when the swords come out in earnest, you will be the only true friend Robert Baratheon will have.</p>

<p>In the books as far as I can tell Loras does not have a birthmark, in fact he reportedly dies before he would even have a trial or the Faith Militant has properly seized control (if they do in the books).</p>

"75571","Did Stannis see himself or another King in the night fire?","<p>In <em>A Storm of Swords</em> Stannis says this to Davos:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I know the cost! Last night, gazing into that hearth, I saw things in the flames as well. I saw a king, a crown of fire on his brows, burning... burning, Davos. His own crown consumed his flesh and turned him into ash. Do you think I need Melisandre to tell me what that means? Or you?”<br /><sup><em>-A Song of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Davos.</em></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He seems to imply that he thinks it is him who will burn because of his own crown. Stannis the Mannis has always taken his responsibility strongly [gritting intensifies], and clearly believes that he must see it through to the end, no matter what it costs himself. 
But we've already seen this exact scene happen with <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Viserys_Targaryen"">Viserys III</a>.</p>

<p>So, <strong>does Stannis see himself in the flames or Viserys?</strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","131396","<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Since it is not possible to give a concrete answer to this as we do not know how this prophecy will unfold yet, this is only my own inference based on canon references. </p>

<p>It cannot be Viserys because he had already died in AGOT. We did not know about this vision until ASOS as you mention. And Stannis saw it a long time after Viserys had died. As far as I recall, Fire does not let you see the past like Greenseers can (Joff's death is kinda complex. I can't recall if Mel saw his death in future or in present at nightfire). </p>

<p>It is unlikely that he was misled into reading the fire that way by Melisandre because Stannis saw this on his own. Besides, Viserys did not turn to ashes. He did not even had a finger set on fire. Only his silken clothes burnt. </p>

<p>From AGOT:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sound Viserys Targaryen made when that hideous iron helmet covered
  his face was like nothing human. His feet hammered a frantic beat
  against the dirt floor, slowed, stopped. Thick globs of molten gold
  dripped down onto his chest, <strong>setting the scarlet silk to
  smoldering</strong>... yet no drop of blood was spilled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also by the time of ACOK, Iron Throne knew Viserys Targaryen had died. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Sit,"" Joff commanded, gesturing her to the empty seat beside his own.
  ""<strong>Have you heard? The Beggar King is dead.</strong>"" </p>
  
  <p>""Who?"" For a moment Sansa was afraid he meant Robb. </p>
  
  <p>""Viserys. The last son of Mad King Aerys. He's been going about the
  Free Cities since before I was born, calling himself a king. Well,
  Mother says the Dothraki finally crowned him. With molten gold.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can assume that word must have passed at least in the nobles so in all probability, Stannis knew about it as well. So he might have also thought that he was looking at fate of Viserys unless he was convinced that he wasn't. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, by ADWD, it was a common knowledge even in lands as far as White Harbor in North. If they knew, we can assume that Dragonstone must have known before them seeing as Dragonstone is the closest Westerosi land in vicinity of Essos. From Davos Chapter 15, ADWD:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You're bloody mad"", said an oarsman off Storm Dancer. ""<strong>The begger</strong>
  <strong>King's been dead for years</strong>. Some Dothraki horselord cut his head off.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nightfire only shows you present, future and possible future. It does not show you the past so I could not have been recap of Viserys' death. As Stannis said to Mel in ASOS:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In the nightfire.” Stannis and Melisandre came through the door
  together. “The flames are full of tricks. <strong>What is, what will be,
  what may be</strong>. You cannot tell me for a certainty...”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The crown Stannis wears is described as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A crown of red gold wrought with <strong>points that look like flames</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe he saw himself in the vision and it shows that his quest to gain the throne will ultimately be failed, no matter before gaining the throne or afterwards, because his own acts and powers will destroy him. The quest is already taking a toll on him as Mel noted that she could not make another shadow baby with Stannis because his <em>Fire were burning too low &amp; it might kill him</em>. He has started looking gaunt and weak with everyday passing. Anyhow, I believe it predicts his own death. </p>

<p>He is Robert's heir and thus a King. But it is quite possible that Stannis just saw some other unknown King. He never said that the King was himself. Nevertheless, It was not Viserys. But It could be Stannis. </p>

"8418","How interwoven are A Song of Ice and Fire and the Dunk and Egg stories?","<p>The title says it all. Are they just stories in the same universe or are the plots connected? </p>

<p>At first I thought they are independent stories, but at the moment I am reading <em>A Feast for Crows</em>, wherein Maester Aemon tells Sam that when he traveled to the Wall, he was accompanied by Dunk and Egg. So I was wondering whether the plots are somehow connected?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","8571","<p>As I recall, GRRM's intention with <em>Dunk &amp; Egg</em> was simply to write a novella set in Westeros, without creating any spoilers for ASOIAF. </p>

<p>In ASOIAF we have already learned the fate of Dunk &amp; Egg (Ser Duncan the Tall and Aegon V), and that, I assume, is somewhat of a spoiler for certain people. So, I will elaborate a bit on that at the end, within spoiler tags.</p>

<p>I would say that as more time (our time =)) passes, the more GRRM weaves the stories together. With the first novella, all we got was a story of how Dunk &amp; Egg met. In short, a story of one of the Targaryen Kings and his Kingsguard. We saw many other prominent names from Westeros' history, which is truly interesting and engrossing, if you are, like I am, fascinated with the world of Westeros.</p>

<p>With the last novella, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/The_Mystery_Knight"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>The Mystery Knight</em></a>, we are introduced to the Blackfyre rebellion, and certain events that tie directly to stories and bloodlines in ASOIAF. There are literally a thousand and one links between the stories, and even someone as thick as a castle wall can ferret them out.</p>

<p>If you study the books in ASOIAF, you will find many references to people, living and dead, that have appeared or been mentioned in Dunk &amp; Egg. Most notably, IMO, a living descendant of Ser Duncan, and a living Targaryen blood relative of the line of Aegon V (minor spoiler mentioned below). And events, most notably the tragedy at Summerhall - the childhood home of King Aegon V (Egg).</p>

<p>It is also noted in ASOIAF, most recently in A Dance with Dragons, I believe, that according to prophecy, <em>The Prince that was Promised</em> would be born of the line of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aerys_II"" rel=""noreferrer"">""mad"" King Aerys II</a>, who coincidentally is the grandson of Egg (Aegon V). The events of Summerhall, are also tied to this prophecy.</p>

<p>So, I would say that the stories are very much interwoven, and that we will be learning much of the background of ASOIAF in the Dunk &amp; Egg series, and vice versa. I found the <em>Dunk &amp; Egg</em> novellas to be fascinating reads, and found myself rereading both them and ASOIAF to investigate the connections.</p>

<p>
This tragedy is said to have occurred because of a certain woods witch connected to Jenny of Oldstones and the Prince of Dragonflies (who might be Aegon V's son and heir).

The comparisons you cited aren't even that similar in my opinion. </p>

<p>For what it's worth, there is a place in Sussex, England called Weir Wood which has a local nature reserve. And the word weirwood brings together two separate words ""weir"" (meaning barrier which obstructs or channels the flow of a river) and ""wood"".

<p>The first time was when she stepped into the funeral pyre of Khal Drogo, which resulted in her dragon eggs hatching.  The second time is in <em>A Dance with Dragons</em>, when she is exposed to Drogon's fire.</p>

<p>In both instances, all that happens to her is her hair is burned away.</p>

<p>I can't be certain, but I believe there may have been references in the first book to her touching burning coals and other hot materials, as well.</p>

<p>Is this a trait shared by other Targaryens?  Her brother certainly wasn't immune to molten gold, and while a number of Targaryens were fascinated with fire (Aerion Targaryen died from drinking wildfire, believing it would turn him into a dragon), I don't recall seeing mention of any Targaryen shrugging off fire.</p>

<p>Is Daenerys' apparent immunity explained anywhere?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","37473","<p>Official Word of God says:</p>

<p>Lastly, some fans are reading too much into the scene in GAME OF THRONES where the dragons are born -- which is to say, it was never the case that all Targaryens are immune to all fire at all times.</p>

"147803","Was Bran's accident a precondition for his recruitment?","<p>I wonder if Bran would have had the same fate without having his accident.</p>

<p>Bran started to dream about the Three-eyed Crow whilst he was in a coma. It appeared then that</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> the old Three-eyed Crow is recruiting his own successor and he chose Bran.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't know if the former Three-eyed Crow, Brynden, was himself injured and how he was recruited.</p>

<p>Do we know if being crippled is a condition to do the ""job""? Being in a coma, was it a condition to be reached, through the dreams?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","147804","<p>Nobody knows the answer to this question yet. But as GRRM says, everything shall be explained in due time. So this will be mere speculation based on canon evidence.</p>

<h3>Who is Three-eyed Crow?</h3>

<p>The Three-eyed Crow is beyond a doubt Brynden Rivers, son of King Aegon IV and known as Bloodraven. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The last greenseer, the singers called him, but in Bran's dreams he
  was still a three-eyed crow. When Meera Reed had asked him his true
  name, he made a ghastly sound that might have been a chuckle. ""I wore
  many names when I was quick, but even I once had a mother, <strong>and the
  name she gave me at her breast was Brynden.</strong>""<br><sub>ADWD-Bran
  III</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""But,"" said Bran, ""he heard me.""</p>
  
  <p>""He heard a whisper on the wind, a rustling amongst the leaves. You
  cannot speak to him, try as you might. I know. I have my own ghosts,
  Bran. <strong>A brother that I loved, a brother that I
  hated, a woman I desired.</strong> Through the trees,
  I see them still, but no word of mine has ever reached them. The past
  remains the past. We can learn from it, but we cannot change
  it.""<br><sub>ADWD-Bran III</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This fits because:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bloodraven loved either Daemon or Daeron II, both his half brothers. </li>
<li>Blooraven hated Aegor Rivers, his half brother. </li>
<li>Bloodraven was infatuated with his half sister, Shiera Seastar. She was one of the chief reasons of the rivalry between Bloodraven and Bittersteel. </li>
</ul>

<p>Also we have his physical appearence where Bran observes that he bears the birthmark Bloodraven had:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What skin the corpse lord showed was white, save for a bloody blotch that crept up his neck onto his cheek</strong>. His white hair was fine and
  thin as root hair and long enough to brush against the earthen floor.
  Roots coiled around his legs like wooden serpents<br><sub>ADWD-Bran
  II</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He also confessed that he was a brother of the Night's Watch in the same chapter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Are you the three-eyed crow?"" Bran heard himself say. A three-eyed
  crow should have three eyes. He has only one, and that one red. Bran
  could feel the eye staring at him, shining like a pool of blood in the
  torchlight. Where his other eye should have been, a thin white root
  grew from an empty socket, down his cheek, and into his neck.</p>
  
  <p><strong>""A … crow?""</strong> The pale lord's voice was dry. His lips moved slowly, as if they had forgotten how to form words. <strong>""Once, aye. Black of
  garb and black of blood.""</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Did Bloodraven himself had any near-fatal experiences?</h3>

<p>We know that Bloodraven must have faced two near-death events:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>He suffered a greivous injury to his head/face in duel against his half-brother Aegor Rivers aka Bittersteel. He lost his eye as a result but survived.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He stared so hard that Bloodraven felt it. The king's sorcerer had
  turned to study him as he went by. He had one eye, and that one red.
  <strong>The other was an empty socket, the gift Bittersteel had given him upon the Redgrass Field.</strong><br><sub>Dunk &amp; Egg: The Sworn Sword</sub></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>He was lost beyond the wall so it is possible that he may have faced a near-death experience out there due to exposure if nothing else. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bloodraven would rise to become Lord Commander of the Night's Watch in
  239 AC, serving until <strong>his disappearance during a ranging beyond the
  Wall</strong> in 252 AC.<br><sub>TWOIAF: Aegon V</sub></p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<h3>Did Jojen and Bran face any near-death experiences before being chosen?</h3>

<p>We have example of Jojen as well. Three-eyed Crow came to him when he was almost fatally ill. He came to Bran when he was also near-death. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Summer raised his head from Bran's lap, and gazed at the mudman with
  his dark golden eyes.</p>
  
  <p>""<strong>When I was little I almost died of greywater fever. That was when
  the crow came to me.</strong>""</p>
  
  <p><strong>""He came to me after I fell,"" Bran blurted</strong>. ""I was asleep for a long time. He said I had to fly or die, and I woke up, only I was
  broken and I couldn't fly after all.""<br><sub>ACOK-Bran IV</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>If we observe the pattern here, two things are common:</p>

<ol>
<li>All three were followers of the old Gods.</li>
<li>All three were in a life-threatening situation. </li>
</ol>

<p>So by that logic we can infer that yes Bran's accident was necessary for his recruitment.</p>

"148272","Who are the Crownlands Houses loyal to?","<p>The Crownlands is an independant region of Westeros, under the rule of the Crown, hence independant of which House is occupying the Iron Throne.</p>

<p>The noble Houses of the Crownlands (e.g. <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Mallery"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mallery</a>, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rosby"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Rosby</a>, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Stokeworth"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Stokeworth</a>...)  are supposed to be loyal to the King, but can they when the King's House is changing?</p>

<p>Loyalty between House is forged over years, sometimes hundreds or thousands years. I don't have examples in mind, but if a House was loyal to Targaryens, did it instantly become loyal to the Baratheons, without keeping bad feelings? Then maybe once they started to accept the Baratheons, they had to change their feelings to the Lannisters?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><laws>","148529","<p>Well the answer is &quot;No but Yes&quot;. The Loyalties can't change and do not change over night. At the same time, when two large powers are fighting for the crown, minor Lordlings may side with one or the other to achieve their own goals. Some prudent ones side with all sides to ensure that their house survives the struggle regardless to the outcome.</p>
<p>I'll divide my answer into following parts to underline the main points here and will link them up in conclusion to provide more causal readers with a summary:</p>
<h3>What is the difference between Crownlands and other Administrative units?</h3>
<p>You are correct that Crownlands are royal fief. This essentially mean:</p>
<ol>
<li>Crownlander Lords fall under direct command of the King.</li>
<li>There are no central figures among them who can unite them into a formidable force other than the King himself.</li>
</ol>
<p>This makes the position of the Crownlander Lordlings very much different than rest of the Kingdoms. Other Kingdoms can and have defied or forsworn allegiance to the King in the past because they all have their own Lords Paramount who can rally them into one force. The contact of those Lords with the ultimate authority, the King, is indirect and flows through their own liege Lords who can choose the sides and factions for them and give them little to no choice.</p>
<p>Similarly, Crownlander Lords have little to no choice except following the King. Given their proximity to KL, the retribution for any defiance is guaranteed to be swift and dire.</p>
<p>They can't challenge the Royal House without support of some other Great House.</p>
<h3>Does that mean that Crownlander Lords are <em>Semper Fidelis</em>?</h3>
<p>Definitely not.</p>
<p>They can and have switched sides as well.</p>
<p>Most notable conflicts in which they have changed sides from one warring party to another are:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dance_of_the_Dragons"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dance of the Dragons</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/First_Blackfyre_Rebellion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Blackfyre Rebellion</a></li>
</ol>
<p>In <em>Dance of the Dragons</em>, Crowlander Lords such as Lord <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Brune_of_Brownhollow"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Brune of Brownhallow</a>, Lord <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Brune_of_the_Dyre_Den"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Brune of Dyre Den</a>, Lord <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Crabb"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Crabb</a> and Lord <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Darklyn"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Darklyn</a> chose to side with <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rhaenyra_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Rhaenyra Targaryen</a> instead of the King in Red Keep, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon_II_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Aegon II</a>.  They were not alone in such defections either. For example, Lord Rowan and Lord Beesbury stood for Rhaenyra even though their liege lord Lord Tyrell was fighting for Aegon II.</p>
<p>In <em>First Blackfyre Rebellion</em>, we do not know much about the standings of most Houses. However, we do know that it split the realm effectively into two so there must have been many Crownlander Lords supporting Daemon instead of Daeron or both.</p>
<p>And of course, the famous <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Defiance_of_Duskendale"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Defiance of Duskendale</a>, in which Lord Darklyn refused to pay taxes and had the King imprisoned by treachery.</p>
<h3>Does Loyalty change over night from Dragon to the Stag?</h3>
<p>No it does not.</p>
<p>Despite Robert's almost good rule, there were many who despised him. Robert knew it himself as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The king shifted uncomfortably in his saddle. &quot;Perhaps. There are
ships to be had in the Free Cities, though. I tell you, Ned, I do not
like this marriage. <strong>There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who
call me Usurper. Do you forget how many houses fought for Targaryen in
the war? They bide their time for now, but give them half a chance,
they will murder me in my bed, and my sons with me.</strong> If the beggar
king crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the traitors will join
him.&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>AGOT - Eddard II</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Targaryen still have many supporters who will rise if a Targaryen pretender could land with a strong enough force to take on the Royal Armies. It is plausible that many of such loyalists will be present in the Crownlander Lords as well, just as there are in every corner of the Seven Kingdoms.</p>
<p>Some were even bold enough to show their coldness to Robert:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The royal party had made themselves the uninvited guests of its lord, Ser Raymun Darry</strong>, while the hunt for Arya and the butcher’s
boy was conducted on both sides of the river. They were not welcome
visitors. <strong>Ser Raymun lived under the king’s peace, but his family
had fought beneath Rhaegar’s dragon banners at the Trident, and his
three older brothers had died there</strong>, a truth neither Robert nor Ser
Raymun had forgotten. <strong>With king’s men, Darry men, Lannister men, and
Stark men all crammed into a castle far too small for them, tensions
burned hot and heavy.</strong><br><sub><em><strong>AGOT - Eddard II</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This states that the behavior of Darrys was not friendly to the Royal Escort due to open dislike of Robert's reign and the fact that there was blood feud between the two. Then again, Darry's aren't crownlander but instead they are Riverlander who had defected from the side of their Liege Lord Tully in Robert's Rebellion.</p>
<p>We do not have much information in this regard about Crownlander Houses as they are very minor and play little to no role in the story's progression. We won't see their true feelings until Daenerys lands, if she ever leaves Meereen, that is.</p>
<h3>Will they feel the same about Lions taking over?</h3>
<p>They don't have to feel anything. Officially, the King is still a Baratheon. They surely must have heard rumors and received letters from Stannis declaring that the King was a lion in a Stag's skin but that doesn't prove anything. But if eventually, the Lannisters do take over openly, Crownlanders will have no choice to grudgingly accept their rule just as they did for the Baratheons. Unless a power large enough to challenge them takes the field and has a viable chance of winning.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<ol>
<li>Crownlanders are not very relevant or powerful on the chesstable of Westerosi politics. They do not have a central figure other than the King who can unite them into a Formidable force. So generally they have to accept everything coming from their Liege Lord, which is the King himself.</li>
<li>Crownlanders have switched sides in the past from the King to the rebels.</li>
<li>There are still many people in seven Kingdoms, specially in Crownlands, Reach and Dorne who detest Robert and his reign. Dorne even tried to rise up for Viserys as soon as Robert took KL.</li>
<li>Loyalties indeed die hard.</li>
</ol>
<p>So in short, Crownlander lords are first and foremost loyal to themselves like anyone else. Then there are other factors such as fear of retribution due to proximity to KL, Honor, Lack of an alternative leader to unite them against the King etc which generally keeps them loyal to whoever holds KL but that's not definite. They have and can change sides to whatever faction suits them.</p>

"216163","Why didn't Aerys II or Rhaegar let the world know that Rhaegar married Lyanna?","<p>It was Rhaegar Targaryen's <em>'kidnapping'</em> of Lyanna Stark and then King Aerys II's murder of her brother Brandon and father Rickard (who went to see Aerys, asking for the justice) that caused Robert's rebellion and eventually, the end of the Targaryen dyansty.<br>
 All of these could have avoided if Rhaegar or Aerys II has announced that Rhaegar didn't kidnap her but married her.<br>
 The Starks would have probably be happy as Lyanna was happy with Rhaegar (it was hinted that Lyanna didn't fancy Robert Baratheon at all). Only Robert would have created a fuss but no other would have joined him to oppose the King. Instead they chose to stay silent, kill Brandon and Rickard and order Jon Arryn to kill his then stewards Robert and Ned.  </p>

<p>Calamities that <strong>could have been</strong> avoided if the 'announcement' path was taken by Rhaegar/Aerys II:   </p>

<p>1) Deaths of Brandon &amp; Rickard Stark<br>
2) Robert's Rebellion (which resulted in the following deaths)<br>
3) Death of Aerys II<br>
4) Death of Rhaegar<br>
5) Death of Lyanna (she died at childbirth, but she could have lived if she was given proper healthcare, rather than letting her to give birth in an isolated tower)<br>
6) Deaths of Sir Arthur Dayne,Sir Gerold Hightower, Sir Oswell Whent (his character was not depicted in the TV show's battle of Tower of Joy) from Kingsguard<br>
7) Deaths of Elia Martell, Prince Aegon &amp; Princess Rhaenys<br>
8) Deaths of countless people from both Targaryen forces &amp; Rebels </p>

<p>It is plausible to say that either Aerys II didn't know the real story about Rhaegar and Lyanna OR he was not thinking wisely, but Rhaegar was a very wise man and he could have done everything to stop needless bloodshed.<br>
My question is, is there any plausible reason for Rhaegar/Aerys II to act like the way they did? </p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","216167","<p>While R+L = J is pretty much confirmed, it still remains a theory as far as books are concerned in absence of any explicit confirmation from the author regarding Lyanna and Rhaegar's relation (Or lack thereof).</p>
<h3>The Timeline</h3>
<p>Here's what we know:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rhaegar outraged the whole realm by crowning the maiden daughter of Lord Rickard Stark, betrothed to Lord Robert Baratheon instead of his legal wife Princess Elia of Dorne. Polygamy is a no-no in faith of the Seven which the Royal family and most of the population adheres to. Only Aegon I's polygamy was tolerated by the faith, and when Maegor tried to follow his father he was exiled and declared a heretic, which eventually sparked the Faith's war against crown. And bear in mind, Aegon and Maegor had dragons.</li>
<li>Rhaegar openly &quot;abducted&quot; Lyanna while she was travelling with her family. King's guards apparently helped him.</li>
<li>Rhaegar goes off-grid and disappears following the kidnapping for reasons best known to him or his associates.</li>
<li>Aerys had no idea what had transpired. Even if someone told him his son had abducted the Stark girl, He'd not mind his son taking up a mistress or two, the King was no stranger to carnal pleasures. Hardly a moral man, Aerys.</li>
<li>Brandon rides to Red Keep and threatens to kill Prince Rhaegar.</li>
<li>For crime of threatening the Blood of the Dragon, Aerys arrests Brandon and his friends and calls for their fathers to present themselves and explain the actions of their sons.</li>
<li>Rickard goes to KL where Aerys burns him and kills Brandon and his friends (Except his squire). The seeds of the war are sown.</li>
<li>Still not satisfied, the mad King commands Lord Jon Arryn to kill his wards Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon.</li>
<li>Jon Arryn calls his banners and fighting begins in Gulltown.</li>
<li>Robert and Eddard make it to their domains.</li>
<li>Robert defeats his royalist vassals and marches his men to Riverlands.</li>
<li>Tyrells defeat Robert at Ashford.</li>
<li>Robert retreats into the Riverlands.</li>
<li>Lord Jon Conington, Hand of the King, surrounds the town Robert was hiding in and Battle of the Bells happens.</li>
<li>Robert is rescued by sudden arrival of Hoster Tully and Eddard Stark's men. Royal army is shattered and scattered to four winds. Rhaegar and Lyanna are still nowhere to be found.</li>
<li>Aerys exiles Lord Jon Conington, commands Prince Doran Martell to send forth his armies, dispatches Sers Barristan Selmy and Jonothor Darry to regroup the shattered remains of Ex-Hand's army, sends Lord Commander Gerold Hightower to find Prince Rhaegar.</li>
<li>Rhaegar finally returns after Ser Gerold finds him, rides to Ruby Ford and dies.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Relationship between Rhaegar and Aerys</h3>
<p>There is no indication that Rhaegar and Aerys had any conversation between the abduction and his return. Furthermore, <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/168653/what-kind-of-relationship-did-aerys-ii-and-rhaegar-targaryen-have?rq=1"">Aerys did not trust Rhaegar</a> and suspected that Rhaegar was trying to usurp his throne with aid of Lord Tywin Lannister. Rhaegar on the other hand was aware that his father was unhinged and he most likely was in league with Lord Tywin Lannister to become Prince Regent for his father, just as Aerys suspected. It is unlikely that he confided in Aerys.</p>
<h3>&quot;Rhaegar fought nobly, Rhaegar fought honourably....and Rhaegar was thick as a brick&quot;</h3>
<p>As to why couldn't he send a raven? Did he send a raven? No one knows. I'd not make too much of Rhaegar's wisdom though. Pure speculation, Rhaegar was an idiot when it came to Lyanna.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;All men are knights and all men are fools when it comes to women&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His actions show that he didn't even expect it to blow up that much. He might have expected that if he disappears until things cool down a bit, he might have a chance of explaining himself in front of all the parties concerned.</p>
<h3>Rhaegar's personality</h3>
<p>He possibly didn't even know that his little stunt had caused a civil war until it was too late. Rhaegar had always been dutiful after all, it's unlike him to knowingly shirk off his duty to his family and the realm. Pure Speculation, I don't think Rhaegar told anyone. He was secretive by nature and his only real friend was Ser Arthur Dayne.</p>
<h3>Why not go public?</h3>
<p>He knew he had acted foolishly but he also knew the cost of going public; Condemnation and excommunication from the Sept (doubly so if he tried to marry her), Wrath of Houses Martell, Stark and Baratheon. Martells would be dishonoured by him taking Lyanna as a concubine just as Starks would be. Baratheons would be angered since Lyanna was promised to Robert. And if Baratheons and Starks are angry, that means Tullys and Arryns are also angry. Rhaegar could not set aside Elia to appease the Starks or take Lyanna as a concubine/second wife/mistress because:</p>
<ol>
<li>It would cause Martells to rise up in Rebellion.</li>
<li>Faith doesn't allow a divorce or annulment if the marriage is consummated. High Septon would have been livid.</li>
<li>It would sow seeds of another Dance of the Dragons, this time between Rhaegar's children from Lyanna and his children from Elia.</li>
<li>Wrath of houses Stark, Baratheon, Tully and Arryn.</li>

"10307","How cold does it get in Westeros?","<p>It's cold. Really cold. <em>""So cold that a man’s laughter freezes in his throat and chokes him to death.""</em></p>

<p>... But coming from Finland and rather merrily facing the current &lt;-25°C outside, I began to wonder how cold is it, really?</p>

<p>Are there any pointers in the books that could be used to make an estimate of the actual temperature ranges throughout Westeros, in wintertime? (measured in °C)</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","10517","<p>From what I've learned in life, people experience cold (and heat) very differently. Currently, we've had down to -30 C outside for a week now, and I know that to many southerners, that would not be simply ""cold"", ""very cold"" or ""incredibly cold"", it would be something like them going outside, clasping their hands to their ears and screaming ""Ahhh!! What is it! What?!"" It's beyond their imagination.</p>

<p>In Turkey when I felt like I was melting, the locals would walk around in t-shirt, shirt and jeans (!). On the flip side, they said it gets ""really cold"" in the winter, when it's +10 C! </p>

<p>I do not recall having read any good depiction in ASOIAF of how cold it actually is. In <em>Dance</em> Jon Snow ""loses some skin"" when he puts a finger on a piece of meat in a cold storage, which to me sounded rather exaggerated. In any real world situation, to lose skin you'd have to perhaps lick your finger and touch it to metal, as meat just does not have the heat conductivity required.</p>

<p>If memory serves, I think that the best descriptions of cold were in <em>A Storm of Swords</em>, during Jon's expedition north of the wall.</p>

<p>I think this lack of visualisation of the cold is due to the fact that GRRM is not from a truly cold climate. When it's ""cold"" in New Jersey (which is on the same latitude as Spain!), it is likely a somewhat wet cold, and snow and sleet makes it worse.</p>

<p>Here in northern Sweden, when it's -30C, it is a dry cold, so dry that moisture freezes on any surface, making the world fuzzy. When it snows, it usually gets warmer (and wetter). When it snows when it is really cold, the snow flakes are not really snow, but very, very small flakes of ice, with a texture like sand, running through your (gloved!) fingers.</p>

<p>When GRRM shows a snowflake drifting down beside the elevator on the Wall, to me, that sounds like warm weather. One large-ish single snow flake, that does not happen when it's truly cold. But I don't know if that was GRRM's intention.</p>

<p>I do not think you can properly extrapolate a description of cold, and I think GRRM knows this, and therefore purposely avoids being too descriptive. Also, it is worth noting that a true comparison would not be too useful, as a person in Westeros without modern clothing, low on food, etc might be much more susceptible to cold.</p>

"149368","Why isn't the religion of R'hllor, The Lord of Light, dominant?","<p>This has been puzzling me for a while now.</p>

<p>Since red priests of R'hllor can, amongst many other seemingly ""magical"" things, bring people back from the dead, how come this religion isn't dominant throughout the World of Ice &amp; Fire (not the single book, but the world of Game of Thrones in general)?</p>

<p>I realise that common people are easily fooled by just about any preacher of any cult, but in this case evidence is completely overwhelming.</p>

<p>It is even more puzzling how people do not get totally freaked out by this. Sure they seem somewhat surprised by the ""oddity"" of somebody being revived, but certainly not enough to become true believers themselves.</p>

<p>Could it be because living in a world with dragons, zombies, warlocks, mind controllers, future seers etc. just diminishes one's ability to be amazed by things we would call supernatural?</p>

<p>But then why even worship gods like the Seven or the Drowned God, who don't even manifest any miracles on a regular basis, at all?</p>

<p>Am I missing something?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><religion>","149372","<p><strong>The religion seems to be <em>gaining</em> power, as the priests <em>gain</em> actual powers.</strong></p>
<p>This is an interesting question, and I suspect that it'll be explored more in future books and that it's deliberate that all we have right now are clues. But there's enough in those clues to tell us that the thing that makes Red Priests presently so impressive was, up until recently, nowhere near as strong as it is now:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Red priests seems surprised by their own power.</strong> Thoros was a jaded drunk who had virtually given up on the faith until, to his great surprise, he bought someone back to life. We see Melisandre openly admit to frequently relying on fakery, lies and parlour tricks in order to increase people's faith - and from how well stocked she is with potions and powders, it seems these parlour tricks are common for red priests. In the TV show but not (yet?) in the books:</p>
<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
<p> Melisandre didn't expect to be able to bring Jon back to life, but managed to.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Magic (particularly fire-related magic) is on the rise.</strong> Pyromancers are making wildfire faster than ever, the warlocks' magic abilities increased (seemingly dragon-related i.e. fire-related), and, in the books but not (yet?) the TV show:</p>
<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
<p> magical obsidian candles suddenly work again. These had not worked for so long, the maesters seemed to assume they <em>never</em> worked and were merely traditional learning props for teaching humility</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something is happening.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The red priests are rapidly gaining influence.</strong> The ones we meet in Volantis seem to be just one book away from bringing about some kind of revolution, from seemingly having been quite minor. Melisandre came from nothing to influence one of Westeros's more powerful lords. They seem to be spreading everywhere, while there's little to suggest that before recently they were much more than one sect among many from a far-flung corner of the far east. The powers in Essos don't seem to see them as a threat (yet!).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It's quite possible (and I suspect might be confirmed in the next book) that the Red Priests were until recently mostly all talk, parlour tricks, and predictions little better than guesses.</p>
<p>There are a few moments we seem them candidly, such as Thoros when he is confessing his past ineptness, and Mel in chapters written from her own perspective. In these moments, they seem to be as surprised at the extent of their current powers as anyone. Melisandre in particular seems to be giddy and drunk on the novelty of having real, actual, non-fake visions that sometimes come (misleadingly) true.</p>
<p>We haven't yet seen the Volantis priests like Benerro and Moqorro candidly. So far, we've only seen them showboating and trying to impress. If/when we do see what they're really thinking, I expect there will be some big reveals that tie in with whatever Marwin has observed about whatever this big change is that is happening.</p>

"79542","What is the historical origin of a ""Silver Stag""? Why do Golden dragons remain in circulation after Robert's Rebellion?","<p>In Westeros there are three coins:</p>

<ul>
<li>Copper Stars (The Seven-Pointed Star is the symbol of the Faith of the Seven.)</li>
<li>Silver Stags (The Stag is the sigil of house Baratheon.)</li>
<li>Gold Dragons (The Dragon is the sigil of house Targaryen.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Was the Stag already on the silver coin before Robert became king?</p>

<p>If so, why? Was house Baratheon that important?</p>

<p>If not, what was on the silver coin during the reign of the Targaryen kings?</p>

<p>Why is the sigil of house Targaryen still on the gold coin after Robert took the crown?</p>

<p>Robert hates the Targaryens so much, even murdering innocent children is OK for him. </p>

<p>Keeping this in mind I find it especially strange, that he doesn't change the sigil on most valuable coin.</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><money>","79679","<h1>Yes; the Silver Stag has been in circulation since before Robert's Rebellion.</h1>

<h2>Chronology</h2>

<p>Robert's Rebellion (RR) also known as the ""War of the Usurper"" occurred at about 282 - 283 AC.</p>

<p>We see the Silver Stag featured in the <em>Dunk and Egg</em> Novellas (which take place roughly 89 years prior to RR in 209 AC):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The Hedge Knight</strong><br />The cloth purse contained three <strong>silver stags</strong>, nineteen copper pennies<br />...<br />“Eight hundred <strong>stags</strong>, for I’m feeling kindly.”<br /><sup><em>-The Hedge Knight - A Tale of the Seven Kingdoms.</em></sup><br /><br /><strong>The Sworn Sword</strong><br />I could pay the man a <strong>silver stag</strong>, and three to the woman for the insult.<br />...<br />“One <strong>silver stag</strong>. And three for you, m’lady.”<br /><sup><em>-The Sworn Sword - A Tale of the Seven Kingdoms.</em></sup><br /><br /><strong>The Mystery Knight</strong><br />""We have no coin for beds.""<br />""We have twenty-two pennies, three stars, <strong>one stag</strong>, and that old chipped garnet, ser.""<br />...<br />He gestured at the piles of <strong>silver stags</strong> and golden dragons on the table.<br />...<br />He picked up a <strong>silver stag</strong> and set it to spinning with a flick of his long fingers.<br /><sup><em>-The Mystery Knight - A Tale of the Seven Kingdoms.</em></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Too Much Work, too Little Time</h2>

<p>If Robert was to change the sigil on the golden dragons, he would have twice the work ahead of him. If he were to change the Dragon to a stag then he would have to also change the stag to something else. Otherwise he would have to change the dragon to something else: </p>

<ul>
<li>Direwolf?</li>
<li>Rose?</li>
<li>Lion?</li>
</ul>

<p>All of which represent some <em>other</em> house, so why not leave dragons which are thought to be the most fearsome, powerful and majestic creatures to represent the highest value coin?</p>

<p>You are also basing your premise on the fact that <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Robert_Baratheon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bobby</a> hated Targaryens when the only evidence is that he hated <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rhaegar_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Rhaegar</a> for ""kidnapping"" <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lyanna_Stark"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lyanna</a>.</p>

<h2>Ah, but coins <em>do</em> change</h2>

<p>You should bear in mind also that the designs of coins in Westeros do actually change; mainly on the ""other side"" - the ""head side"" - of the coin. The change happens much the same way in real life to signify the change in Monarch. But the original coins remain in circulation until naturally phased out. </p>

<p>In <em>The Mystery Knight</em> we see</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dunk speaking to <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Uthor_Underleaf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Uthor ""The Snail"" Underleaf</a> whilst The Snail counts his winnings from the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Whitewalls_tourney"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Whitewalls Tourney</a>. They discuss a certain ""King"" on one of the gold dragon coins and realise that it is the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daemon_Blackfyre"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""wrong"" king</a>. Here's how Dunk outlines the previous kings on the dragons:<br /><br />Frowning, he hefted the coin in his palm, examined both sides, tasted it. ""Gold, not shaved or clipped. The weight feels right. I'd have taken it too, m'lord. What's wrong with it?""<br />""The king.""<br />Dunk took a closer look. The face on the coin was young, clean-shaved, handsome. King Aerys was bearded on his coins, the same as old King Aegon. King Daeron, who'd come between them, had been clean-shaved, but this wasn't him. The coin did not appear worn enough to be from before Aegon the Unworthy. Dunk scowled at the word beneath the head. Six letters. They looked the same as he had seen on other dragons. DAERON, the letters read, but Dunk knew the face of Daeron the Good, and this wasn't him. When he looked again, he saw that something odd about the shape of the fourth letter, it wasn't ... ""Daemon,"" he blurted out. ""It says Daemon. There never was any King Daemon, though, only--""<br />""--the Pretender. Daemon Blackfyre struck his own coinage during his rebellion.""<br /><sup><em>-The Mystery Knight - A Tale of the Seven Kingdoms.</em></sup></p>

<p>The current coinage system used is from the post-conquest era. There have been known to have been at least one other type of coinage used in the pre-conquest era:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are older coins, still in use from before the War of Conquest. In A Feast for Crows we learn of gold coins of the Kingdom of the Reach, which were known as 'hands', they feature the hand-shaped sigil of House Gardener on one side and the face of a king on the other, with each coin roughly half the value of a golden dragon.<br /><sup><em>-<a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Currency#cite_note-Raffc7.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Currency#cite_note-Raffc7.7B.7B.7B3.7D.7D.7D-2.</a></em></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>And Finally, So Spake Martin</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yes indeed. And much more medieval. It occurs to me too that Westerosi coinage is probably more complex than actual British medieval coinage, since the Seven Kingdoms were actually seven kingdoms once... <strong>and presumably each king minted his own coins</strong>.

"79544","Why didn't Ned Stark ask for a trial by combat?","<p>I know he has a different religion, but he could have demanded a trial through combat, why not?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","79549","<p>Well, there never was a trial, since Eddard confessed to save his daughter -- so <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Trial_by_combat"">trial by combat</a> could never happen.</p>

<p>Here are the relevant quotes from the books. It starts with Varys visiting Ned in his cell:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Varys tsked. “Cersei will not want to hear that, I promise you.
  Stannis may win the throne, but only your rotting head will remain to
  cheer unless you guard that tongue of yours. Sansa begged so sweetly,
  it would be a shame if you threw it all away. You are being given your
  life back, if you’ll take it. Cersei is no fool. She knows a tame wolf
  is of more use than a dead one.” </p>
  
  <p>“You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king, butchered my
  men, and crippled my son?” Ned’s voice was thick with disbelief. </p>
  
  <p>“I want you to serve the realm,” Varys said. “Tell the queen that you
  will confess your vile treason, command your son to lay down his
  sword, and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir. Offer to denounce
  Stannis and Renly as faithless usurpers. Our green-eyed lioness knows
  you are a man of honor. If you will give her the peace she needs and
  the time to deal with Stannis, and pledge to carry her secret to your
  grave, I believe she will allow you to take the black and live out the
  rest of your days on the Wall, with your brother and that baseborn son
  of yours.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ned isn't very forthcoming, so Varys reminds him that his family is also at risk:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“So what is your answer, Lord Eddard? Give me your word that you’ll
  tell the queen what she wants to hear when she comes calling.”</p>
  
  <p>“If I did, my word would be as hollow as an empty suit of armor. My
  life is not so precious to me as that.”</p>
  
  <p>“Pity.” The eunuch stood. “And your daughter’s life, my lord? How precious is that?” </p>
  
  <p>A chill pierced Ned’s heart.</p>
  
  <p>“My daughter …”</p>
  
  <p>“Surely you did not think I’d forgotten about your sweet innocent, my
  lord? The queen most certainly has not.”</p>
  
  <p>“No,” Ned pleaded, his voice cracking.</p>
  
  <p>“Varys, gods have mercy, do as you like with me, but leave my daughter
  out of your schemes. Sansa’s no more than a child.”</p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <p>Varys gave a long weary sigh, the sigh of a man who carried all the
  sadness of the world in a sack upon his shoulders. “The High Septon
  once told me that as we sin, so do we suffer. If that’s true, Lord
  Eddard, tell me... why is it always the innocents who suffer most, when
  you high lords play your game of thrones? Ponder it, if you would,
  while you wait upon the queen. And spare a thought for this as well:
  The next visitor who calls on you could bring you bread and cheese and
  the milk of the poppy for your pain … or he could bring you Sansa’s
  head. The choice, my dear lord Hand, is entirely yours.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The next time Eddard appears in the book is when Arya sees him confess in public:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Her father raised his voice and began again. “I am Eddard Stark, Lord
  of Winterfell and Hand of the King,” he said more loudly, his voice
  carrying across the plaza, “and I come before you to confess my
  treason in the sight of gods and men.”</p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <p>Her father raised his voice still higher, straining to be heard. “I
  betrayed the faith of my king and the trust of my friend, Robert,” he
  shouted. “I swore to defend and protect his children, yet before his
  blood was cold, I plotted to depose and murder his son and seize the
  throne for myself. Let the High Septon and Baelor the Beloved and the
  Seven bear witness to the truth of what I say: Joffrey Baratheon is
  the one true heir to the Iron Throne, and by the grace of all the
  gods, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All that's left is the sentencing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The High Septon knelt before Joffrey and his mother. “As we sin, so do
  we suffer,” he intoned, in a deep swelling voice much louder than
  Father’s. “This man has confessed his crimes in the sight of gods and
  men, here in this holy place.” Rainbows danced around his head as he
  lifted his hands in entreaty. “The gods are just, yet Blessed Baelor
  taught us that they are also merciful. What shall be done with this
  traitor, Your Grace?”</p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <p>Prince Joffrey … no, King Joffrey … stepped out from behind the
  shields of his Kingsguard. “My mother bids me let Lord Eddard take the
  black, and Lady Sansa has begged mercy for her father.” He looked
  straight at Sansa then, and smiled, and for a moment Arya thought that
  the gods had heard her prayer, until Joffrey turned back to the crowd
  and said, “But they have the soft hearts of women. So long as I am
  your king, treason shall never go unpunished. Ser Ilyn, bring me his
  head!”</p>

<p>The walkers clearly spared these two people because they could have overpowered and killed either.</p>

<p>From a tactical point of view, the walkers gain nothing by sparing anyone. They are better off killing the person and thereby recruiting the person into their undead army. And the downside is that the survivor can warn others who would then flee the walkers. The result is that the walkers have fewer people to recruit because many humans fled.</p>

  men.” He glanced around. “<strong>Up the tree. Be quick about it. Look for a
  fire.</strong>” .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br> “<strong>Will, where are you?</strong>” Ser Waymar
  called up. “Can you see anything?” He was turning in a slow circle,
  suddenly wary, his sword in hand. He must have felt them, as Will felt
  them. There was nothing to see. “Answer me! Why is it so cold?”</p>
  
  <p>It was cold. Shivering, <strong>Will clung more tightly to his perch</strong>. His
  face pressed hard against the trunk of the sentinel. He could feel the
  sweet, sticky sap on his cheek.</p>

<p>His commander, Waymar Royce fought the white walkers and died:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Royce went to his knees, shrieking, and covered his eyes. Blood welled
  between his fingers.</p>
  
  <p>The watchers moved forward together, as if some signal had been given.
  Swords rose and fell, all in a deathly silence. It was cold butchery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When he finally came down Royce came back to ""life"" and killed him. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Will rose. Ser Waymar Royce stood over him.</p>
  
  <p>His fine clothes were a tatter, his face a ruin. A shard from his
  sword transfixed the blind white pupil of his left eye.</p>
  
  <p>The right eye was open. The pupil burned blue. It saw.</p>
  
  <p>The broken sword fell from nerveless fingers. Will closed his eyes to
  pray. Long, elegant hands brushed his cheek, then tightened around his
  throat. They were gloved in the finest moleskin and sticky with blood,
  yet the touch was icy cold.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The third ranger, Gared, ran off before the white walkers showed up and was later seen south of the wall. The Starks did not take his talk about white walkers seriously and beheaded him for deserting the Night's Watch.</p>

<p>As for Sam, in Storm of Swords, chapter 18 (first Sam chapter, very close to the end) they are retreating from the Fist of the First Men and encounter a white walker: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And then he was stumbling forward, falling more than running, really, 
  closing his eyes and shoving the dagger blindly out before him with both
  hands. He heard a crack, like the sound ice makes when it breaks beneath
  a man's foot, and then a screech so shrill and sharp that he went 
  staggering backward with his hands over his muffled ears, and fell hard
  on his arse.</p>
  
  <p>When he opened his eyes the Other's armor was running down its legs in 
  rivulets as pale blue blood hissed and steamed around the black dragonglass
  dagger in his throat. It reached down with two bone white hands to pull
  out the knife, but where its fingers touched the obsidian they smoked.</p>

<p>... &quot;Lord Tywin is not the Kingslayer. He will not rush in heedless. He will wait patiently for Ser Stafford to march before he stirs from behind the walls of Harrenhal.&quot;</p>

<p>In <em>Game of Thrones</em>, Varys has a network of spies, whom he calls ""little birds"". </p>

<p><strong>Is there a connection between the Crebain and the little birds?</strong></p>
","<tolkiens-legendarium><the-lord-of-the-rings><game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","150611","<h1>Probably not</h1>

<p>However we do not know for sure, as there's no evidence to suggest that George R. R. Martin <em>wasn't</em> inspired by Tolkien in this particular way.</p>

<p>From my extensive knowledge and a search of many of his talks and posts, I can tell you that he hasn't mentioned this. This is probably because no one has asked him this question in the past<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p><strong>Let's analyse</strong><br>
Now, there <em>are</em> certain similarities to these characters:</p>

<ul>
<li>Saruman uses literal birds as spies</li>
<li>Varys uses little children which he calls his ""little birds"" as spies</li>
<li>Saruman is a sorcerer of sorts</li>
<li>Varys is an enigmatic character (but says he's against magic)</li>
</ul>

<p>I think that's about where the similarities end. In fact, the point of turning the literal birds controlled by magic (in Saruman's case) into figurative ones which are real (in Varys' case) is actually a big deal. To me, this is an anti-pattern.</p>

<p>You see, although GRRM has said that he is very much inspired by Tolkien's writing in general; for example, he has mentioned on numerous occasions<sup>2</sup> that his magic is ""off screen"" similar to in Tolkien's <em>Lord of the Rings</em> works. However, he tends to find faults<sup>3</sup> in them and goes about ""correcting"" them, adding an even more ""realistic"" approach.</p>

<p><strong>But wait, there's <strike>more</strike> Bloodraven</strong><br>
A better question would be, <strong>is Bloodraven's Raven inspired by Saruman's Crebain?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Gnarly old white magic dude</li>
<li>Controls birds and uses them as spies</li>
<li>You don't know whether he is good or bad, at first</li>
<li>Plays an ""overwatch"" and influencer role</li>
<li>Uses Ravens/Crows/Crebain to spy for him</li>

<p>Fast-forward a few seasons to the Battle of Hardhome, and we see multiple walkers and the Night King all wearing clothes and armor. (Never guessed he was just a little vain enough to wear a decoration on his upper chest.)</p>

<p><strong>Why did they start wearing armor?</strong> (Related questions: Why would they even care to wear clothes at all? They don't need clothing to protect them from blizzards. Do they make their own armor and clothes?)</p>

<p>I prefer answers from the book (even if the answer says the question is based on a false premise) more than answers from the TV series.</p>

<p><strong>Edit to add:</strong> I am not asking about the wights, just the White Walkers and the Night King. I assume the wights and skeletons have whatever clothes they wore at the moment of re-animation and will wear those until the clothes are so shredded they fall off.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","149703","<p>Since you have added the books tag, I will avoid the show heresy and answer this from the books.</p>
<h3>What do Others aka White Walkers wear?</h3>
<p>In books, others do not run around naked. They are dressed in a special magical armor which camouflages them into their surroundings.</p>
<p>From <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Others"" rel=""noreferrer"">wiki</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Had many talks with George. He told me of the ice swords, and <strong>the
reflective, camouflaging armor that picks up the images of the things
around it like a clear, still pond</strong>. He spoke a lot about what they
were not, but what they were was harder to put into words.&quot;<br> <sub>-<strong>Tommy Patterson</strong> <em>(Comic book artist for the series)</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A shadow emerged from the dark of the wood. It stood in front of
Royce. Tall, it was, and gaunt and hard as old bones, with flesh pale
as milk. <strong>Its armor seemed to change color as it moved; here it was
white as new-fallen snow, there black as shadow, everywhere dappled
with the deep grey-green of the trees.</strong> The patterns ran like
moonlight on water with every step it took.<br><sub>AGOT -
Prologue</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So while we may not know what exactly do they wear due to reflective nature of their garb, we know they wear an armor so presumably some other garment underneath as well. Therefore, The idea that they run around naked or with minimal clothing is absurd.</p>
<p>As far as books are concerned, they always wear armor (Except maybe when it is a nice sunny day, then I presume they go sunbathing on the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Frozen_Shore"" rel=""noreferrer"">Frozen shore</a>).</p>

"79733","Why don’t people fight over religion in the universe of A Song Of Ice And Fire, like they do in ours?","<p>How come, in a world that can be described as barbaric and cruel and pretty much similar to the medieval ages in our universe, people who pray for the old gods and the new gods are fine with that, whereas they do share our thirst for battle over other things such as belonging to two ancient houses that were involved in feuds over simple things?</p>

<p>Apart from the followers of the lord of light R'hllor (that if you ask me is a clear parallel to Islam as it shares its provenance from the east and the radical followers), all other religions live in peace, and we don't even feel the discrimination by religion between people.</p>

<p>I will try to reformulate the question to be more precise: are there any mentions of past feuds in Westeros over religions and faiths?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","79738","<p>Neither of the two major religions in Westeros have a strong emphasis on proselytizing. The faith in the Old Gods is held by the people of the north and those beyond the wall. It is somewhat of given since for practical purposes, the Weirwood trees have been there for 6000 years. As the faith is tied to the trees, there is no motivation to expand the faith beyond the areas where the trees grow.</p>

<p>The New Gods are imported from Essos, but that was a few thousand years ago also. There does not seem to be any evidence in cannon of Septims being ordained as missionaries and trying to go north to convert the northerners to the New Gods. </p>

<p>Overall the attitude toward religion is far more alike that of the Pre-Christian Ancient Near East, and the Pre-Christian world in general. When you met an enemy that had a different faith, it was your gods against theirs. Your success on the battlefield was directly tied to the success of your gods. When you made peace, the faith's mingled; some believed some gods, some believed in others, and it was not really a big issue (Except for a few ""jealous"" gods). </p>

<p>During the Medieval European era, political motivations led the Catholic Church to wage a war for the trade routes on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea. This land was valuable to the Babylonian Empire, and the Assyrian Empire, and to Alexander the Great, and the Ptolemies and the Seleucids. The church used the guise of liberating the ""Holy Land"" from heathens and heretics to gain access to the trade routes.</p>

<p>The politics of Westeros are, to some degree, separate from the religion of the people. The Western, Southern, and Eastern domains follow the Seven Faces of God, as does King's Landing. It would not be effective for a Lannister to try to rally support against a Tyrell under the banner of the Seven since both sides are faithful. It may be possible for the Southern domains to unite under the banner of the Seven and march north to cut down all of the Weirwoods and eradicate the faith in the Old Gods, but no one seems motivated to do that. </p>

<p>The phrase of prayer ""the Old Gods and the New"" is spoken by many people in various locations some more devout than others. It shows the underlying feeling of most people is that they will follow any gods so long as they give the person what he or she is praying for, and that in desperate times either or both are acceptable. It could almost be said that all of Westeros is one religion in transition between the Old Gods and the New, and that nearly everyone believes in both, just to varying degrees.</p>

<p>Whether that qualifies Catelyn as undead or not depends on what one means by ""undead."" If ""undead"" means she is a mindless zombie similar to those raised by the White Walkers, then probably not. If, however, it is something more akin to Beric Dondarrion, then yes.</p>

"11503","Why are there no maps of lands east of Westeros in The Game of Thrones?","<p>The <em>Dothraki</em> come from a land (Essos) that is east of Westeros, and separated by the Narrow Sea. But the map given in the book (<em>A Game of Thrones</em>) doesn't show anything beyond Dragonstone. Is there a reason for this?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><game-of-thrones>","11518","<p>I would speculate that it is because - I believe - ASOIAF is largely inspired by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_the_Roses"">War of the Roses</a>, and Great Britain in general. If you look at the map of Westeros, you will notice a certain resemblance to the British isles. </p>

<p>The War of the Roses' is the war between the houses Lancaster (red rose) and York (white rose), which is rather a good match for house Lannister and Stark, down to the color. Even the location of the city Lancaster is similar to the location of Casterly Rock. We have also have titles, e.g. Lords, knights (called ""Ser""), tourneys, which are all words of English origin.</p>

<p>When you scan a map of England with an eye for ASOIAF details, you will notice many similarities, in shape, location of cities, rivers/bays, etc.</p>

<p>One such very interesting resemblance I found was <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian%27s_Wall"">Hadrian's Wall</a>, an ancient roman fortification in northern England. It is quite similarly located on the map as The Wall in Westeros. Like The Wall, the reasons for erecting Hadrian's Wall are similarly shrouded in mystery. In fact, I just found this quote on the wikipedia page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>American author George R. R. Martin has acknowledged that Hadrian's
  Wall was the inspiration for the wall in his A Song of Ice and Fire
  series.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With all this in mind, it is easy to imagine that GRRM can easily picture Westeros, whereas Essos remains more abstract. Given that the series was at first meant to be a trilogy, it is not even certain that he ever gave Essos much thought, until, of course, the series grew and expanded. And I believe this is the reason we do not have better maps of Essos.</p>

<p>I do not believe we will ever see very detailed maps of Essos in ASOIAF. I think the focus of the series will soon be shifted entirely to Westeros, and also, I think that there is too much focus on scrutinizing GRRMs works for him to have the possibility to sift through all his books and lock down all the details.</p>

<p>Personally, though, I am very interested in seeing a proper map of Valyria and the surrounding areas, to see their empire as it was during their reign.</p>

<p>Why did Euron venture there, and what was there for him to risk that trip?</p>

<p>Fast forward to <em>A Storm of Swords</em>. When Dany ""buys"" her unsullied from Astapor, they give her a translator (since they don't know she actually speaks Valyrian) who Dany subsequently frees. The translator, however, agrees to travel with Dany despite the danger. The interaction goes something like </p>

<p>""Valar Morghulis"", ""Indeed everyone must die"" </p>

<p>so we learn that ""Valar Morghulis"" translates to ""everyone must die."" </p>

<p>Now, a few chapters later when we get back to Arya she comes upon some northmen caged up in the city. The men are dying of thirst and Arya gives them water (before they are shot by Anguy). After giving them water, they are shot with arrows to the throat and Arya mutters </p>

<p>""Valar Morghulis.""</p>

<p>My question is, does Arya somehow know the meaning of these words at this point? Or is it just coincidence she said them at this time?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","11850","<p>Arya seems to be catching on to the meaning of the words, even without any direct explanation. In Clash, the words were given to her by Jaqen when <em>""Across the yard, she could hear men dying.""</em> She also immediately adds them to her ""prayer"". </p>

<p>Then later the coin and the words, just as Jaqen, is associated with death - she uses the coin to distract the man she kills, and she says the words again.</p>

<p>Then, in Storm we're told the words have become the standard ending in her ""prayer"". Later on, they again come to her mind right after she witnesses a death.</p>

<p>So it could be that because of her history with them, she's just happened to associate them correctly. Or maybe it was something in the way Jaquen said them to her...</p>

<p>But my reading of this is that the words almost call out for Arya. Like Jaqen, they have a mystical air to them. Nothing well defined, but there's something strange there. They fit their meaning, and Arya instinctively associates them with death.</p>

"12064","Who is Coldhands?","<p>In <em>A Storm of Swords</em>, Sam encounters Coldhands who leads them through the Wall via the Black Gate.  He appears to have once been a Ranger of the Night's Watch, though it's clear he's now dead, and this is confirmed by Leaf in <em>A Dance with Dragons</em>.  He kills pretty indiscriminately both men of the Night's Watch and wights.</p>

<p>Has this been addressed in <em>A Dance with Dragons</em> and I missed it?  Is there speculation?  I have my own thoughts as to who it might be, but I'd be curious to know if anyone else has a legitimate answer to this. </p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","12110","<p>There is speculation on who <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Coldhands"">Coldhands</a> is, as described <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/FAQ/Entry/Who_is_Coldhands/"">here</a> and <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Coldhands/Theories"">here</a>, for example. I'll discuss the <em>The Last Hero</em> and <em>Benjen Stark</em> theories. And also a theory of my own.</p>

<p>The Last Hero is the person from <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Game_of_Thrones-Chapter_24"">Old Nan's story about the Last Hero</a> who went out into the cold north with a squad of men, and was hounded by the Others, seeing his friends, his horse and even his dog die. I believe she tells him this story right after he wakes up from his coma. Quote from the wiki:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thousands of years ago, a winter fell like no other, and there came a
  night that lasted a generation. The Others came during that winter,
  and they hated fire, iron, and the touch of the sun. This was before
  the Andals had come, and before the women of Rhoynar, when the First
  Men lived in the lands they had taken from the Children of the Forest.
  The Others had slaughtered many, and couldn’t be stopped, so the last
  hero of the First Men set out to find the Children. He left with his
  sword, a dog, his horse and twelve companions. When only he was left,
  in despair of ever finding the Children, the Others closed in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The connection between this hero and the Children, who we now know to be connected to Coldhands, somewhat supports the theory of them being one and the same.</p>

<p>The theory is also somewhat supported by Leaf saying <code>""He died long ago""</code>, which may imply that ""long ago"" is too long of a time span to be anyone who died recently, seeing how she is reportedly very old herself.</p>

<p>One interesting piece of information about ""The Last Hero""-Coldhands is that he knows about the Old Gate at the Nightfort, which only brothers of the Night's Watch may pass. Presumably, its existence is not common knowledge, and may imply that Coldhands lived long ago. Although it is easily thwarted by things like (Spoilers for ADWD):</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>It may be <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Brynden_Rivers"">Bloodraven</a>'s/The three eyed-crow's knowledge, which is fairly believable, as we know that he is very well versed in magic, and knows the Wall well, having been the Lord Commander. And: Someone like Benjen Stark might very well have access to such rare knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, while cold preserves, it does feel -- to me, at least -- a bit unbelievable that even an undead, stored in freezing cold, could last thousands of years.</p>

<p>The evidence of him being Benjen Stark, are even more meager. I believe all we have going for that theory is:</p>

<ul>
<li>He is reportedly a former man of the Night's Watch, as evidenced by him calling Sam ""Brother"" and wearing black clothes.</li>
<li>He saves Sam, is an ally of the <em>Children</em> and the three-eyed crow, and seems to be on the side of the good guys.</li>
<li>His appearance in the story coincides with Benjen's disappearance.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of which are pretty weak, as evidence goes. For example, he could easily be lying about being a black brother, or it could be some misunderstanding that he just never denied. Him being a ""good guy"" could simply be a direct effect of him being the three-eyed crow's minion. And of course, many people disappeared around the time Coldhands appeared, and plenty of black brothers died on the Fist, right before Coldhands appearance.</p>

<p>The single strongest motivating factor (not evidence!) for Benjen = Coldhands might be that people want it to be him: Rather than him being dead, having him reappear as a good guy, taking care of Bran. I myself am one such person, although I would prefer if he would reappear alive.</p>

<p>Hence, my theory largely stems from the happy moment when Sam was saved by Coldhands' flock of ravens, and I was thinking: ""So this is what happened to Benjen!""</p>

<p>One idea that I do like is the combination of the two: That Benjen's fate is shadowing the fate of <em>The Last Hero</em> from Old Nan's tale; that his is a role that is repeated, much like Azor Ahai's.</p>

<p>A personal theory of mine (spoilers ADWD): </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>is that Coldhands could be a friend of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Brynden_Rivers"">Bloodraven</a>, from his days in the Night's Watch. Since he was Lord Commander and a magic user, it could easily be one of his former brothers. Which would make sense of the connection between them, rather than Coldhands being just any random person. It would also support Leaf's statement ""He died long ago."" since Bloodraven is fairly old.
<p>
For a wild moment, I was considering if he could be <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dunk"">Dunk</a>, but that would be unlikely, as Dunk is known to have perished at Summerhall with <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon_V_Targaryen"">Egg</a>. We do know that Bloodraven aka Brynden Rivers came to the wall with the honour guard who escort Maester Aemon to the wall, so if this theory is correct, we could find Coldhands among those. There should have been some fairly important names in that group.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While this theory would be interesting, I am much more in favour of the Benjen theory. It feels right, and it feels better. </p>

<p>In short, there is no clear evidence as to who Coldhands is -- or was, before he died. I would say that many things point to his identity being irrelevant, since wights do seem to lose much of their personality when they die, and it is plausible that all we see of Coldhands personality is actually the three-eyed crow's.</p>

<p>My gut feeling is that Coldhands' (former) identity will be revealed. Mostly because GRRM built up some suspense around his character and purposely did not let Bran see his face. And also because I think we will know the fate of Benjen eventually, and as I said, I am a believer in the particular theory that binds those two mysteries together.</p>

"12065","What is the difference between a wight and an Other?","<p>What is the difference between a wight and an Other in <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>?</p>

<p>At first I didn't think there was a difference, but there must be because Others can be ""melted"" by dragon glass and wights cannot.</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>

<p>ETA:  So, I've started re-reading the series, and I came across a passing, though interesting, mention of Others and wights in <em>A Game of Thrones</em>.  Old Nan is telling Bran the story of the last hero and she says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Old Nan nodded.  ""In that darkness, the Others came for the first time,"" she said as her needles went <em>click click click</em>.  ""They were cold things, dead things, that hated iron and fire and the touch of the sun, and every creature with hot blood in its veins.  They swept over holdfasts and cities and kingdoms, felled heroes and armies by the score, riding their pale, dead horses and leading hosts of the slain.""
  <em>A Game of Thrones</em> pg. 203 Kindle edition</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I recalled that we were discussing whether wights and Others were working in concert with each other or merely two separate populations that happened to coexist in forests north of the Wall.  From what Old Nan says, it would appear that the wights are, indeed, ""soldiers"" drafted into the Others' army.  </p>

<p>I realize this in no way answers my initial question, and I still think that the accepted answer is the most thorough response to the actual question.  This merely stands to confirm that wights and Others are definitely not the same creatures.</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","12099","<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Others"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Others</a> are some sort of Ice demons, whereas <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Wight#Wights"" rel=""noreferrer"">wights</a> are reanimated corpses. Not just human, but any corpse, as we have seen multiple times in the books, dead bears, horses, etc.</p>

<p>In the Prologue to <em>A Game of Thrones</em> you can read about both wights and Others. The Others are the one that surround Ser Waymar Royce, and watch him duel a single Other, and then ceremonially finish him off once he's fallen. You will notice they are described as sleek, intelligent and fast.</p>

<p>Conversely, when Will climbs down from the tree, he is killed by Ser Waymar Royce, who has now become a wight. Wights are in later books described as being rather like zombies: Gruesome, slow and clumsy, and not particularly intelligent.</p>

<p>(Note that in the TV-show, we see something completely different, but again we see both wights and Others)</p>

<p>I do not believe we know how wights are raised, or by whom exactly. I'm not entirely certain if we have ever seen them even work together (someone correct me with a specific example if I am wrong). It would be just like GRRM to show two different murderous types of beings and just by being vague allow us to believe they are allies. </p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Others who kill Ser Waymar Royce do not have any wights with them.</li>
<li>The wight of Royce attacks Will on his own accord, no Others in sight.</li>
<li>The attack on the Night's Watch force in <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_the_Fist_of_the_First_Men"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>The battle of The Fist of the First Men</em></a> seemed to be made by a force of wights.</li>
<li>When Sam kills the wight of Small Paul (with a glowing ember), he encounters a horde of wights outside. Again, only wights.</li>
<li>When Sam kills the Other (with the dragonglass dagger), there are no wights around.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, in the book, people do claim that wights are the servants of the Others.</p>

<p>Presumably, the theory is that the Great Other, some old, ancient evil has woken again after sleeping for thousands of years, sending out its captains -- the Others -- and resurrecting corpses as footsoldiers to create an army.</p>

<p>An interesting note is that it is hinted at that Craster is creating Others by sacrificing his newborn sons. I believe one of the old women at his compound tells Sam something like “They are coming. The sons.”, by which she ought not to mean wights, since infant-sized wights would hardly be a large threat.</p>

<p>Further hints to such an alliance of Craster's is that he is an outsider among the wildlings, he keeps himself separate from them, and Mance seems to know him for an enemy -- or at the very least, not a friend. Also noted when the Night's Watch take refuge at Craster's compound after the Battle of the Fist, Craster himself claims that he is ""a godly man"", that need not fear wights and Others. And indeed, they are not attacked by wights while staying there, even though they were hounded by wights the whole way there.</p>
"
"81363","How could Craster be that confident?","<p>OK. Craster lives in his Keep. His daughters/wives are just servants and cannot help with defending against hypothetical attack. This leaves Craster as the only element able to defend. Let's leave aside he looks quite old and fat (Barristan Selmy also looks old) and let's suppose he can swing with his axe really well. Still, he is alone.</p>

<p>If I was in his position and group of Night Watch members visited me (armed, some skilled, although tired and wounded), I would be very far from mocking them, threatening them, even attacking them. I would be clear that in case of fight, I would definitely lose.</p>

<p>Still, he always behaves like he is invincible and no one could (would dare to?) harm him. <strong>Why?</strong> Is he simply stupid? Or is there anything I missed? Or anything omitted in the series?</p>

<p>Many times I considered parts of Game of Thrones weird or illogical, but after reading Wiki or answers here, I had to admit I just missed something. This is kind of last piece I couldn't find anything about.</p>

<p>Before Eddard's time, this large area was an independent kingdom ruled by the Starks as Kings in the North for thousands of years, before the Andals invaded Westeros 6000 years ago. The Northerners successfully fended off the Andals, who settled in the Southern regions. According to these legends they've ruled the North continuously for around 8000 years, which has made them very powerful and, yes, rich.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do they get their money from taxes for people living on their land?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eddard Stark represents the Iron Throne as Warden and Lord Paramount of the North, after the Seven Kingdoms were united into one under the Targaryens. With this comes, among other things such as military responsibilities, the responsibility of collecting taxes from the other Northeners.</p>
<p>We don't know how those taxes are budgeted and how much goes to the Iron Throne, but GRRM has <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Social_Structure_Moat_Cailin_and_More"" rel=""noreferrer"">confirmed</a> that the Great Houses make their money from &quot;taxes and customs duties&quot;. In the North's case it's probably mostly taxes, since there are few roads of import there. Northern citizens make their money (which they pay their taxes with) on wool, hides and smithing according to the books, as well as timber, which according to the <em>Game of Thrones</em> Telltale game includes the Ironwood of the wolfswood, exported to build ships all over Westeros.</p>

"81530","How do lords and knights gain land and influence?","<p>There are cases described in the <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> books in which some commoner gains a title of knight/lord, knights gain a title of lord, and lords gain more influence and land - the individual climbs up the feudal ladder. I know that battles are among such cases.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> The most notable example is the Battle of the Blackwater where several honors have been given out after the successful defense of King's Landing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first part of the my question is:
<strong>Apart from battles, what other cases of granting honors and land are described in the books?</strong></p>

<p>For the second part, I am wondering if a knight/lord has some initiative to get a title or land. I mean something like</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Petyr Baelish's conspiracy which turned him from a meaningless, poor, virtually landless lord to high lord of Riverlands.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but on a smaller scale.</p>

<p>Can some petty lord raid and take over some other lord's land (excluding actual war)? What would be the higher lord's reaction? Can a high lord take land from one of his vassals and grant it to the other, or is only the king able to do it?</p>

<p>To sum it up:
<strong>What can a knight/petty lord do to impove his situation in the feudal hierarchy?</strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","81562","<p>Titles and lands are two separate issues.</p>

<h1>Titles</h1>

<ul>
<li>New titles and honours can be arbitrarily made up by the King, as when Baelish is made Lord Paramount of the Trident.</li>
<li>Some existing offices are in the gift of the King and can be reassigned at will, such as seats on the Small Council and positions such as Warden of the North.</li>
<li>Feudal lordships (such as Lord of Winterfell) are inherited rather than granted by the King. These cannot be arbitrarily reassigned, although they may fall vacant if the family has no legitimate heir, or a lord found guilty of treason or rebellion may be stripped of his titles.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Lands</h1>

<p>There are basically three ways of getting new land:</p>

<h2>Conquest</h2>

<p>This is uncommon in Westeros, although it can happen, as when Tywin Lannister took over the lands of the Reynes of Castamere. Historically it was quite common, for example in the Norman Conquest of England; later English conquests in France, Scotland, Ireland and Wales; or events such as the Crusades or the Spanish Reconquista. A ruler would seize new territory and distribute it among his followers.</p>

<p>Most rulers strongly discourage open warfare <em>between</em> their followers; it weakens the realm and undermines the overlord's authority. If the overlord is weak, his or her followers may ignore this and go to war with each other regardless.</p>

<p>Conquest may not be as dramatic as marching off to war with banners flying. It is also possible to gain territory though some combination of intrigue, murder and dirty tricks.</p>

<h2>Marriage/inheritance</h2>

<p>Land isn't bought and sold in a feudal system, so in theory this is the only ""routine"" way of getting new land.</p>

<h2>Confiscation</h2>

<p>As with titles above, a lord's lands may be taken and reassigned as a punishment.</p>

<h1>The Bolton Example</h1>

<p>Roose Bolton is an excellent, albeit extremely ruthless, example of how a lord can rise under this system. Through betrayal, warfare, and murder, as well as marriages (his own and his bastard son's), he rises from a moderately important vassal of Winterfell to become Warden of the North and (arguably) its most powerful lord.</p>

<p>If the Wall is there to keep Wildings out, and everyone knows the Wildlings are behind the Wall <em>in fact the Wildlings are constantly raiding south of the Wall, which is why there is no one left for the Night's Watch to tax</em>, why then does no one fund it?</p>

<p>If the Wildlings overrun the Wall, it's bad news for everyone in the south.</p>

<p>I've read the books and seen the shows but I can't remember if anyone ever explains <em>why</em> no one funds the Wall.</p>

<p>Is there ever a reason given? </p>

<p>It's pretty important but no one seems to care about it.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","81587","<p>The wildlings have invaded the Seven Kingdoms several times. Every single time, they were crushed before they even reached Winterfell. Typically, they were crushed <em>by</em> the Starks of Winterfell, in their capacity as Warden of the North.</p>

<p>Simply put, the wildlings pose no threat to Highgarden, to Casterly Rock, not even to the Riverlands just below the Neck. So right off the bat, the vast majority of the Kingdoms have basically nothing to gain by sending aid to the Night's Watch, other than ridding itself of criminals and mouths to feed.</p>

<p>But even Northerners see the wildlings as more of a nuisance than an existential threat. As Jon tells Ygritte, Mance Rayder's undisciplined army is bound to lose to the discipline and military tactics of the Seven Kingdoms. </p>

  <p>Ned saw the dread on her face. “Mance Rayder is nothing for us to
  fear.” (Eddard I, AGOT)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So when you get down to it, the people south of the Wall neglect it because they don't see any threat that the roughly 1000 brothers of the Night Watch can't handle. Obviously, they've all forgotten that the Wall wasn't built to keep out men...</p>

<p>*The title is worded that way for tag hits.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","151575","<p>She buys a lot of Unsullied, in the books.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Of thousands, there are eight. Is this what she means
  by all? There are also six centuries, who shall be part of a ninth thousand when complete. Would
  she have them too?”</p>
  
  <p>“I would,” said Dany when the question was put to her. “The eight thousands, the six
  centuries... and the ones still in training as well. The ones who have not earned the spikes.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>She has enough gold and merchandise to buy a thousand, and her crown is worth 100:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Your men have gone
  through my ships and tallied every bead of amber and jar of saffron. How much do I have?”</p>
  
  <p>“Sufficient to be buying one of thousands,” the Good Master said, with a contemptuous smile.</p>
  
  <p>“Yet you are paying double, you are saying. Five centuries, then, is all you buy.”</p>
  
  <p>“Your pretty crown might buy another century,” said the fat one in Valyrian. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this is what she ends up paying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“All your goods, save your crown and your queenly raiment, which we will allow you to keep. The three ships. And Drogon.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Her goods are worth 500, assuming she's paying double.  Three ships are worth 2000:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Three good ships should be worth
  more than a few paltry eunuchs.” </p>
  
  <p>The fat Grazdan turned to the others. They conferred in low voices once again. “Two of the
  thousands,” the one with the spiked beard said when he turned back. “It is too much, but the
  Good Masters are being generous and your need is being great.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The dragon is therefore worth a lot.  Since she buys about 9000 Unsullied plus some more slaves in training, for whom she pays the same amount.  So I'll say the dragon is worth 9500-2500=7000 Unsullied, which is the value of (3*(7000/2000))=10 and a half ships.  One Unsullied is 3/2000 the price of a ship.</p>

<p><strong>So how much is a ship?</strong></p>

<p>In the words of Salladhor Saan in <em>Clash of Kings,</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the Red Keep we shall feast, while the dwarf sings us a jolly tune. When you speak to King
  Stannis, mention if you would that he will owe me another thirty thousand dragons come the black of the moon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Saan has 30 ships.  One sellsail in a month costs 1000 dragons.  But we still don't know the cost of a ship for buying.  This is the closest I can find to evidence.</p>

<p>The economy in Westeros is interesting.  It isn't as much based on money as on value.  Prices aren't set, they're bargained.  In Essos, for example, a slave is a perfectly good unit of value, like a coin.  And an Unsullied is a more valuable slave in the same way that a gold coin's value changes based on its weight.  In the transaction that took place with the Unsullied, no gold traded hands, only goods.  So I would say that it's unfair to judge the price of an Unsullied in gold.  One robot-slave-eunech-soldier thing is worth whatever one is willing to pay for a robot-slave-eunech-soldier thing.  One dragon is worth however much you're willing to pay for it, especially since dragons have never been sold before, and so don't have a price.</p>

<p>This shows that even the Lannisters, who are the most powerful family in the country, are afraid of the Iron Bank.</p>
<h3>So <em>how</em> does it always get its money back? Is there anything in the books states how it does get it back?</h3>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","151734","<p><strong>Always remember the following words...</strong></p>
<h2>The Iron Bank will have its due.</h2>
<hr />
<p>The bank will not issue new loans unless payments are being made on older ones, and it seems like that may be enough..</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A group of merchants appeared before her to beg the throne to intercede for them with the Iron Bank of Braavos. <strong>The Braavosi were demanding repayment of their outstanding debts, it seemed, and refusing all new loans.</strong> We need our own bank, Cersei decided, the Golden Bank of Lannisport. Perhaps when Tommen's throne was secure, she could make that happen. <strong>For the nonce, all she could do was tell the merchants to pay the Braavosi usurers their due.</strong></p>
<p><em>A Feast for Crows - Cersei VIII</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Although if and when it is not enough for the Iron Bank, they will still have their due...</p>
<p>Remember one of the main reasons the Bank decides to give loans to Stannis is because the current regime is not paying. Stannis gives the Bank another form of recourse. It is a large gamble that ultimately failed, but their intent was to back a new King would pay his debts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The banker pressed his fingers together. &quot;It would not be proper for me to discuss Lord Stannis' indebtedness or lack of same. As to King Robert... it was indeed our pleasure to assist His Grace in his need. For so long as Robert lived, all was well. <strong>Now, however, the Iron Throne has ceased all repayment.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><em>Could the Lannisters truly be so foolish?</em> &quot;You cannon mean to hold Stannis responsible for his brother's debts.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>&quot;The debts belong to the Iron Throne,&quot; Tycho declared, &quot;and whosoever sits on that chair must pay them.</strong> Since young King Tommen and his counselors have become so obdurate, we mean to broach the subject with King Stannis. <strong>Should he prove himself more of our trust, it would of course be our great pleasure to lend him whatever help he need.&quot;</strong></p>
<p><em>A Dance with Dragons, Chapter 44 (Jon IX)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jon continues to reflect on what happens to those who do not pay the Iron Bank, as he had just signed a deal as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He did not have to like it, though. And come spring, when the time came to repay all that gold, he would like it even less. Tycho Nestoris had impressed him as cultured and courteous, but <strong>the Iron Bank of Braavos had a fearsome reputation when collecting debts.</strong> Each of the Nine Free Cities had its bank, and some had more than one, fighting over every coin like dogs over a bone, but <strong>the Iron Bank was richer and more powerful than all the rest combined.</strong> When princes defaulted on their debts to lesser banks, ruined bankers sold their wives and children into slavery and opened their own veins. <strong>When princes failed to repay the Iron Bank, new princes sprang up from nowhere and took their thrones.</strong></p>

<p>If all else fails, the Iron Bank could hire the Faceless Men, like Petyr Baelish had suggested Robert do with Daenerys. Although, there is no direct evidence that to support the Bank has done this...</p>

<p>Littlefinger himself also implies that he will serve any fetish as long as the gold is right.

<p>[Petyr] <strong>All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.</strong></p>

<p>Another example would be the young girls Meryn Trant requests while in Braavos.</p>

<ol>
<li>To eat of human meat.</li>
<li>To mate as wolf with wolf.</li>
<li>To seize the body of another human is the worst abomination.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rains_of_Castamere"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">In episode 9 of season 3</a>, we saw Jon Snow kill the wildling skinchanger, Orell, with a sword. At the moment of death, Orell wargs into a bird and tries to claw out Jon's eyes. When Jon Snow was stabbed by his own men, I assume he warged into his direwolf and learned this was possible because of his experience with Orell. (Orell's death occurs at 3:30 into this video clip.)</p>

<p>I think Orell could have warged into Jon Snow, Tormund Giantsbane, or somebody else instead of warging into the bird.</p>

<p><strong>Is there proof of any skinchangers evading death by warging into another human?</strong></p>

I'll take book quotes over scenes from the TV series. Lastly, I will consider fan theories and well grounded speculation based on the books.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","151999","<p>Varamyr Sixskins does not completely believe in Haggon and the rules of skinchangers are more like code of ethics, rather than rules.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Men may eat the flesh of beasts and beasts the flesh of men, but the man who eats the flesh of man is an abomination.</p>
<p>Abomination. That had always been Haggon’s favorite word. Abomination, abomination, abomination. To eat of human meat was abomination, to mate as wolf with wolf was abomination, and to seize the body of another man was the worst abomination of all. Haggon was weak, afraid of his own power. He died weeping and alone when I ripped his second life from him. Varamyr had devoured his heart himself. He taught me much and more, and the last thing I learned from him was the taste of human flesh.</p>
<p><sub><sup><strong>A Dance with Dragons: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Five, Prologue</strong> </sub></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coming back to your question, is it possible to warg into another human?</p>
<p><strong>The answer is Yes,</strong> Varamyr avoided it for following reasons</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I should have taken one of them when I had the chance. One of the twins, or the big man with the scarred face, or the youth with the red hair. He had been afraid, though. One of the others might have realized what was happening. Then they would have turned on him and killed him. And Haggon’s words had haunted him, and so the chance had passed.”</p>
<p><sub><sup><strong>A Dance with Dragons: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Five, Prologue</strong> </sub></sup></p>

<p>In the books, there is only one instance when a dying man tries to warg into another human, that is when <strong>Varamyr tries to warg into Thistle</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“He summoned all the strength still in him, leapt out of his own skin, and forced himself inside her.</p>
<p>Thistle arched her back and screamed.</p>
<p>Abomination. Was that her, or him, or Haggon? He never knew. His old flesh fell back into the snowdrift as her fingers loosened. The spearwife twisted violently, shrieking. His shadowcat used to fight “him wildly, and the snow bear had gone half-mad for a time, snapping at trees and rocks and empty air, but this was worse. “Get out, get out!” he heard her own mouth shouting. Her body staggered, fell, and rose again, her hands flailed, her legs jerked this way and that in some grotesque dance as his spirit and her own fought for the flesh. She sucked down a mouthful of the frigid air, and Varamyr had half a heartbeat to glory in the taste of it and the strength of this young body before her teeth snapped together and filled his mouth with blood. She raised her hands to his face. He tried to push them down again, but the hands would not obey, and she was clawing at his eyes. Abomination, he remembered, drowning in blood and pain and madness. When he tried to scream, she spat their tongue out.”</p>
<p><sub><sup><strong>A Dance with Dragons: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Five, Prologue</strong> </sub></sup></p>

<p>Varmyr failed to warg into a human, he was weak and hungry but he was a strong warg.</p>

  <p>Is Bran, a male highborn, entitled to a hand servant? </p>

<p>I think the simplest answer that can be given here is: Yes, if he can afford it. <br>
Highborn people with money can afford hand servants, so they can have as many as they want.</p>

<p>I wouldn't call Hodor a slave. Slaves are like those people Daenerys meets on Slaver's Bay (and releases them). People that have no freedom at all. Slaves are what people used Africans for on the U.S. plantations so many years ago.</p>

<p>Hodor would be more like an in-house help or servant. Rich people still have this kind of help nowadays. They don't feed them the best food, but they are free.</p>

<p>I don't recall any mention of Hodor making complains (I know he can't talk, but he does express his feelings). So, he must think that his job is okay. He is a mentally challenged person that would have trouble at pretty much any job. But instead, he lives and works with a family that respects and loves him. I actually find that good-hearted.</p>

</ol>

</blockquote>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Like I mentioned above I don't think Bran is actually abusing Hodor. He does what every person with a servant would do. Also, take note that Game of Thrones doesn't take place in the 21st century. It takes place in a fictional Medieval-themed world. That means that people don't have the human rights you and I do.<br></li>
<li>We don't really know how much free will Hodor has or how he ended up working for the Starks. The fact that his grandma (Old Nan) worked there for many years might have played some role.  Also, like I mentioned above, we pretty much can assume that he wouldn't be the best in some other work<br></li>
<li>The Starks actually feel like he is a part of their family.</li>
</ol>

<p>It would also be good to point out that there is a difference between the meaning of the words 'slave' and 'servant'. To put it as simply as I can:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>servant</strong> is someone who <em>willingly and voluntarily</em> serves someone.</li>
<li><strong>slave</strong> is someone who <em>involuntarily and against his will</em> serves someone.</li>

  <p> When Lancel Lannister and the other Sparrows go to retrieve Cersei from the Keep for her trial, Lancel begins following a small child into the area underneath the Sept. The child then stabs Lancel, followed by the scene depicting Lancel crawling in an effort to blow out the flame.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does this scene have any significance, or was it just a set up to show the audience what was happening/to come? Was it included in the novel?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","152340","<p>The books haven't gotten that far yet. This is likely to come in the upcoming novel ""<em>The Winds of Winter</em>"" (which has the same title as the final episode). So I can't help give you an answer from the books.</p>

<p>From the show's point of view however, having Lancel follow one of the ""Little Birds"" into the tunnels under the Sept gave us an idea of how the explosion was set up and how it would take place. It is likely Lancel would've died either way, however by having him be led into the Sept's cellar not only gives the viewers an idea of the scale of the operation, but also keeps alive the possibility that Lancel can save the Sept and everyone inside.</p>

<p>This answer is very opinionated, since it is the final episode in the TV series, and has not yet been mentioned in the novels.</p>

<hr>

<p>I was however able to find an interview with the actor where he discusses the scene a little bit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What was it like crawling through the corridor?</strong><br>
  The thing about the whole scene was that for the last two years, we’ve seen Lancel be this stoic, disciplined, focused individual, with a rather limited demonstration of much emotion. But when the worst happens to him, and he finds himself staring death in the face, he tries to do his utmost to solve it. He doesn’t give up. He doesn’t cry. But he is, for the first time we’ve seen in a while, really brave. He wants to make sure everything he’s worked for doesn’t go up in flames. And having just suddenly been paralyzed, and being on his own, with no one around him, he would probably bleed to death anyway if he didn’t get the candles out in time. And yet, he still does his best. I found that to be rather emotional, because for all of his bad choices, all the bad things that have happened to him, he still tries his very hardest to do what he believes to be right. And that made him vulnerable again. I could have played that entire reaction very robotically, the way he’s been. But instead, I let him cry out in pain and didn’t deprive him of his humanity. He was still human. He was scared. He didn’t want to die. But I am glad that my character has died the way he has. It was quite a cathartic experience for me.<br>

<h3>How do ASOIAF regions compare to our world?</h3>
<p>George R.R. Martin has compared Westeros to South America and Essos to Eurasia . He <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Geography"" rel=""noreferrer"">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will post the dates and times of my signing tour in the &quot;touring&quot;
thread uptopic. Thanks for asking.</p>
<p>As for your other questions (boy, you folks are relentless), <strong>I don't</strong>
<strong>have the precise population of King's Landing on[sic] the exact area of</strong>
<strong>Westeros immediately on hand.</strong></p>
<p>In very general terms, however... King's Landing is more populous than
medieval London or Paris, but not so populous as medieval
Constantinople or ancient Rome.</p>
<p>Some readers have likened Westeros to England because they see some
general similarities in its shape, and in its location off the west
coast of a larger landmass. The latter is true enough (I don't see the
former, myself), but <strong>Westeros is much much MUCH bigger than Britain</strong>.
<strong>More the size (though not the shape, obviosuly) of South America</strong>, I'd
say.</p>
<p><strong>The other continent is bigger (Essos), Eurasia size.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, a league is three miles.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3>Should you worry about how long it takes to travel in Westeros and how big it is?</h3>
<p>Also George R.R. Martin is deliberately vague about such matters. He said in another <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/2787"" rel=""noreferrer"">correspondence with the fans</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I have deliberately tried to be vague about such things, so I don't have obsessive fans with rulers measuring distances on the map and
telling me Ned couldn't get from X to Y in the time I say he did</strong>.</p>
<p>However, if you really must know, <strong>you can figure out the distances
for yourself. The Wall is a hundred leagues long. A league is three
miles. Go from there.</strong></p>
<p>But if you turn up any mistakes in travel times by using that measure,
let it be your secret.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3>You really wanna know, don't you?</h3>
<p>If, to quote GRRM, you are really that obsessed fan, Well put that calculator and ruler back. <a href=""https://atlasoficeandfireblog.wordpress.com/2016/02/28/the-size-and-extent-of-westeros/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Another fan has roughly done the work</a> for you by estimating the size.

<p>However, she deliberately does not mention this to the Kindly Man.  He seems exceptionally able to see through her every attempt at deception.

I would say that it is somewhat likely that he already knows, and does not care.

<blockquote>
  <p>Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, <strong>father no children</strong>. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.

I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all nights to come. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why do they need to vow that? Why celibacy is important for the order? </p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","14313","<p>I believe the vows of the Night's Watch go back through the ages, in the order of thousands of years, back to mythical heroes like Brandon the Builder and before him. GRRM has allowed his characters somewhat free interpretation of what these vows mean.</p>

<p>Sam (and Bran's group) was made aware of the old gate, under the Nightfort, which tied the vow to the gate's magical quality. I believe there are more such ancient magical qualities tied to the vow. There seems to be some purpose to Jon and Sam saying their vows before a heart tree, for example.</p>

<p>Many black brothers seem to believe that protecting the realm from wildlings is the core of the oath, whereas we have seen that Stannis and Jon have made the interpretation that their duty is to protect the realms of <em>men</em>, in which wildlings are considered on the side of the realm. I believe this comes close to the original intent of the vow. As Lord Commander Mormont said (paraphrasing):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You don't build a wall hundreds of feet high to keep out raiders.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the time when the oath was conceived, I believe the intent was to form an elite guard force, whose sole task was to guard against the ancient evil, the Long Night, The Great Other. As is mentioned in many of Jon's chapters, I cannot remember if it was Maester Aemon or Lord Commander Mormont, family ties are strong, and the ones who test a man's oath the hardest.</p>

<p>While other men might be part of the realm; Lords, servants, knights, fathers, etc, the Night's Watch stands outside it. They have severed all ties to it. Their sole focus is the danger north of the wall. It is in their name: The Night's Watch, they who watch against the Long Night.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Night gathers, and now my watch begins.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are watchmen. Not primarily soldiers, or an army.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>It shall not end until my death.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Making this pledge binds you forever, so that you shall never have any cause to think of your <em>past</em> or your <em>future</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the meat of the pledge: To forever forsake your claim to your place in the realm.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold,
  the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the
  shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to
  the Night's Watch, for this night and all nights to come.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This last part to me has always revolved around ""the watcher on the walls"", ""I shall live and die at my post"" and ""the horn that wakes the sleepers,"" -- which also ties into the very dramatic 1-2-3 blasts of their horn signals: Once for rangers returning, twice for wildlings, three times for Others.</p>

<p>While other people, such as for example the Lord of Winterfell and his men, may take up arms against the enemies of the realm, they are not pledged to guard against the Long Night, their attention may be divided. They might enjoy coming home a cold evening, sitting in front of their fire with their children and turning a blind eye to the dark and cold night outside.</p>

<p>But someone has to be the one to keep watch, to wake the sleepers, to bear witness to strange events, to listen to the forest and sense the creeping cold. Someone who spends his life in the cold and empty forests and learns how to read its signs.</p>

<p>Much like in the prologue to AGOT, Gared and Will could sense something was wrong, but Ser Waymar Royce could not.</p>

<p>I guess in short it boils down to no division of loyalty and no distractions. Much like any knight can protect the king in his own right, and has his own place in the protection around the king, a knight of the Kingsguard has the duty of being the first and innermost line of defense. His watchfulness can never waver for a second, as Ser Barristan notes in ADWD:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But the battle was never truly done for a knight of the Kingsguard. Threats came from everywhere and nowhere, at any time of day or night. [....] For every hour of fighting, a Kingsguard knight spent ten thousand hours watching, waiting, standing silent in the shadows. King Hizdahr's pit fighters were already growing bored and restive with their new duties, and bored men were lax, slow to react.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think Lord Commander Mormont demonstrated it the best. On their ranging, he comes to the conclusion that something very bad is happening, that the wall and the Night's Watch's purpose is not what they thought. He was able to make that deduction because his only focus in life is being the watcher on the walls. That guard who has spent thousands of hours watching and recognizes the danger in time.</p>

<p>In Tyrion's first trial by combat, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbUeobf0MRg"" rel=""noreferrer"">Bronn versus Ser Vardis</a> it was clear that Vardis was losing and he seemed to be aware of that (in the show at least, I don't remember if the book make it obvious that Ser Vardis is aware that he his losing). It also seems that Bronn would accept the yielding because he waits a few seconds before giving the deadly stab.</p>

<p>Why didn't Vardis Egen yield?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","152783","<p>Ser Vardis Egen was the captain of Jon Arryn’s household guard, an honorable position. Multiple reasons forced Ser Vardis Egen to fight or die at the hands of Bronn, some of these are:</p>
<p><strong>Honor of representing the House Arryn:</strong></p>
<p>Ser Vardis was selected over other knights who wanted to fight Tyrion Lannister.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lady Lysa raised a hand for silence. “I thank you, my lords, as I know my son would thank you if he were among us. No men in the Seven Kingdoms are as bold and true as the knights of the Vale. Would that I could grant you all this honor. Yet I can choose only one.” She gestured. “Ser Vardis Egen, you were ever my lord husband’s good right hand. You shall be our champion.”</p>
<p><sub><sup><strong>A Game of Thrones, Chapter 40, Cateyln</strong> </sub></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Bronn was a sellsword:</strong></p>
<p>Sellswords are not respected by Knights. It would have been disrespectful/insulting for Ser Vardis to surrender to a sellsword.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ser Morton Waynwood said. “Ser Vardis is a knight, sweet lady. This other fellow, well, his sort are all cowards at heart. Useful enough in a battle, with thousands of their fellows around them, but stand them up alone and the manhood leaks right out of them.”</p>
<p><sub><sup><strong>A Game of Thrones, Chapter 40, Cateyln</strong> </sub></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Ser Vardis was fighting with Jon Arryn's sword:</strong></p>
<p>Lysa had given Jon Arryn's sword to Ser Vardis. It was considered an honor to the old knight.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ser Vardis held out a gauntleted hand, and his squire placed a handsome double-edged longsword in his grasp. The blade was engraved with a delicate silver tracery of a mountain sky; its pommel was a falcon’s head, its crossguard fashioned into the shape of wings. “I had that sword crafted for Jon in King’s Landing,”</p>
<p>&quot;I thought it only fitting that our champion avenge Jon with his own blade.&quot;</p>
<p><sub><sup><strong>A Game of Thrones, Chapter 40, Cateyln</strong> </sub></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Loyalty to Lady Lysa:</strong></p>
<p>Even when most knights realized Ser Vardis was in trouble, Lady Lysa commanded him to fight on and he fought.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blind with arrogance as they were, even the knights and lords of the Vale could see what was happening below them, yet her sister could not. “Enough, Ser Vardis!” Lady Lysa called down. “Finish him now, my baby is growing tired.”</p>
<p>And it must be said of Ser Vardis Egen that he was true to his lady’s command, even to the last. One moment he was reeling backward, half-crouched behind his scarred shield; the next he charged. The sudden bull rush caught Bronn off balance.</p>

<h3>History of Qarth</h3>
<p>Qarth was founded by <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Qaathi"" rel=""noreferrer"">Qaathi</a> people who originated in the Dothraki sea region in the earliest days of humanity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What can be said is that the Qaathi arose in the grasslands and
established towns there, coming into contact and occasional conflict
with the Sarnori. They would oft have the worse of these wars, and so
began to drift farther south, creating new city-states. One such,
Qarth, was founded on the coast of the Summer Sea. Yet the lands in
the south of Essos proved more inhospitable than those the Qaathi had
vacated, turning to desert even as they established their foothold
there. The Qaathi people were already well on their way to collapse
when the Doom struck, and any hopes of using the chaos in the Summer
Sea to their advantage vanished when the Dothraki attacked, destroying
all the remaining Qaathi cities save for Qarth
itself.<br><br><sub>TWOIAF- Beyond the Free Cities: The
Grasslands</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of the Qaathi cities were destroyed due to Dothraki invasions after fall of Valyria and ensuing <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/143194/54887"">century of blood</a> save for Qarth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the south, other khals led their hordes into the Red Waste,
destroying the Qaathi towns and cities that once dotted that desert,
until only the great city of Qarth remained, protected by its towering
triple wall. Despite their long history, little can be said with any
certainty of the Qaathi—a people now gone from the world save for a
remnant in Qarth.<br><br>.<br><br>.<br><br>.<br></p>
<p>Most of these peoples are gone now, their cities burned and buried,
their gods and heroes all but forgotten. Of the Qaathi cities, only
Qarth remains, dreaming of past glories beside the jealously guarded
Jade Gates, which link the Summer and Jade seas. The others were
extinguished, driven into exile, or conquered and assimilated by the
people who succeeded them.<br><br><sub>TWOIAF- Beyond the Free Cities:
The Grasslands</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Due to the city's strategic position on the eastern sea lanes, it soon turned into a trade hub which expanded when the Valyrian seapower vanished and Volantis became too occupied with its own ambitions west-wards during century of blood era.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet in a way, the Dothraki destruction led to a resurgence for Qarth.
Forced to look instead to the sea, the Pureborn who ruled Qarth
swiftly constructed a fleet and took control of the Jade Gates—the
strait between Qarth and Great Moraq, which joins the Summer Sea to
the Jade Sea. With the Valyrian fleet destroyed, and Volantis's
attention turned west, there were none to oppose them as they
established control over the most direct route between east and west,
and so gained immeasurably in both trade and levied tolls for safe
passage.<br><br><sub>TWOIAF- Beyond the Free Cities: The Grasslands</sub></p>

The knight is described as wearing green armor very similar to King Renly's with golden antlers coming form the head. </p>

"15019","Who was the other man Ned despised?","<p>On page 200 in <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, Catelyn tells Ned that Littlefinger will help them. In the following paragraph, Ned thinks</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It would not be the first time that Ned had been forced to make common cause with a man he despised.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reading this casually, one might just think that it is a pragmatic statement, but seeing as <em>A Game of Thrones</em> in general, and Ned's chapters in particular are so riddled with vague statements of great import, I was immediately intrigued as to whether this refers to a specific person.</p>

<p>My first, and as of yet only, thought was</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> that it was Rhaegar. When Lyanna died, she made Ned promise (<em>Promise me, Ned</em>) to shield Rhaegar's son from Robert. So in a sense, Ned would have made common cause with someone he'd have reason to harbour animosity against.<p>
However, it does not quite ring true. Lyanna and Rhaegar's disappearance seems to have been them simply falling in love, and Ned would hardly in good conscience <em>despise</em> the man Lyanna loved. Ned's feelings of despise seem to be reserved only for people who behave dishonourably. I also doubt very much that Rhaegar had anything to do with Lyanna dying (besides getting her pregnant). So, it does not feel quite right that Ned should despise him.<p>
Also, of course, Rhaegar was not actually around at the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tower_of_Joy"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>Tower of Joy</em></a>, and it does not seem likely that he had a conversation with any of the Kingsguard, since he killed them all. (Besides, they were honourable men, so he would not despise them).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But if not him, then who? Varys? Roose Bolton? Jorah Mormont? Someone across the narrow sea? Is there some reference I have missed?</p>

<p>I just remembered something from ADWD:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>In the Davos chapter where he talks to the Lord of Sisterton Ned Stark is mentioned as having passed through there and saying something like ""If I fail, I was never here."" There is also mention (possibly red herring) about a fish wife and a bag of silver. A smuggler would be someone Ned would have cause to despise... seems personal enough, but pretty thin.</p>
</blockquote>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","189433","<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> It's never made explicit in the text itself but there are some options for who it is likely to be. I will list them roughly in order of most to least likely though Tywin Lannister is the most likely candidate.</p>

<hr>

<p>Ned had to make common cause with the Lannister's after Robert's Rebellion due to Tywin funding the Seven Kingdoms and Robert having married Cersei. He doesn't appear to have gotten over some of their actions though.</p>

<h3>Tywin Lannister</h3>

<p>He makes it clear in these passages that he distrusts Tywin and has no care for him even going as far as to be prepared to insult him.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Ned would sooner entrust a child to a pit viper than to Lord Tywin</strong>, but he left his doubts unspoken. Some old wounds never truly heal, and bleed again at the slightest word. ""The wife has lost the husband,"" he said carefully. ""Perhaps the mother feared to lose the son. The boy is very young.""</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>""A generous offer, my friend,"" the king said, ""but too late. Lord Tywin has already given his consent. Fostering the boy elsewhere would be a grievous affront to him.""</p>
  
  <p>""<strong>I have more concern for my nephew's welfare than I do for Lannister pride</strong>,"" Ned declared.</p>
  
  <p><sup>A Game of Thrones, Eddard I</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He also thinks of Tywin as a murderer of innocents and appears to despise him still for giving the orders to kill the children.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ned did not feign surprise; Robert's hatred of the Targaryens was a madness in him. <strong>He remembered the angry words they had exchanged when Tywin Lannister had presented Robert with the corpses of Rhaegar's wife and children as a token of fealty. Ned had named that murder;</strong> Robert called it war. When he had protested that the young prince and princess were no more than babes, his new-made king had replied, ""I see no babes. Only dragonspawn."" Not even Jon Arryn had been able to calm that storm. Eddard Stark had ridden out that very day in a cold rage, to fight the last battles of the war alone in the south. It had taken another death to reconcile them; Lyanna's death, and the grief they had shared over her passing.</p>
  
  <p>This time, Ned resolved to keep his temper. ""Your Grace, the girl is scarcely more than a child. <strong>You are no Tywin Lannister, to slaughter innocents.</strong>"" It was said that Rhaegar's little girl had cried as they dragged her from beneath her bed to face the swords. The boy had been no more than a babe in arms, yet Lord Tywin's soldiers had torn him from his mother's breast and dashed his head against a wall.</p>
  
  <p><sup>A Game of Thrones, Eddard II</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He also thinks of the man as dishonourable for when he betrayed the Mad King during the Sack of King's Landing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Not our men,"" Ned said patiently. ""Lannister men. The lion of Lannister flew over the ramparts, not the crowned stag. <strong>And they had taken the city by treachery.</strong>""</p>
  
  <p>The war had raged for close to a year. Lords great and small had flocked to Robert's banners; others had remained loyal to Targaryen. The mighty Lannisters of Casterly Rock, the Wardens of the West, *had remained aloof from the struggle**, ignoring calls to arms from both rebels and royalists. Aerys Targaryen must have thought that his gods had answered his prayers when Lord Tywin Lannister appeared before the gates of King's Landing with an army twelve thousand strong, professing loyalty. <strong>So the mad king had ordered his last mad act. He had opened his city to the lions at the gate.</strong></p>
  
  <p><sup>A Game of Thrones, Eddard II</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Jaime Lannister</h3>

<p>Like Tywin he doesn't appear to trust Jaime very much hoping that Robert won't name him Warden to the East because that would mean he would eventually hold the Est and West.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Kingslayer,"" Ned said. The rumors were true, then. He rode on dangerous ground now, he knew. ""An able and courageous man, no doubt,"" he said carefully, ""but his father is Warden of the West, Robert. In time Ser Jaime will succeed to that honor. No one man should hold both East and West."" <strong>He left unsaid his real concern; that the appointment would put half the armies of the realm into the hands of Lannisters.</strong></p>
  
  <p><sup>A Game of Thrones, Eddard II</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again he reiterates that he doesn't trust Jaime and even spells it out clearly for Robert. He even thinks he is dishonourable for sitting himself atop the Iron Throne. He also appears to dislike Jaime's arrogance and cockiness.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>""Can you trust Jaime Lannister?""</strong></p>
  
  <p>""He is my wife's twin, a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard, his life and fortune and honor all bound to mine.""</p>
  
  <p><strong>His sword helped taint the throne you sit on</strong>, Ned thought, but he did not permit the words to pass his lips. ""He swore a vow to protect his king's life with his own. Then he opened that king's throat with a sword.""</p>
  
  <p>""Seven hells, someone had to kill Aerys!"" Robert said, reining his mount to a sudden halt beside an ancient barrow. ""If Jaime hadn't done it, it would have been left for you or me.""</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>""I cannot answer for the gods, Your Grace … only for what I found when I rode into the throne room that day,"" Ned said. ""Aerys was dead on the floor, drowned in his own blood. His dragon skulls stared down from the walls. Lannister's men were everywhere. Jaime wore the white cloak of the Kingsguard over his golden armor. I can see him still. Even his sword was gilded. <strong>He was seated on the Iron Throne</strong>, high above his knights, wearing a helm fashioned in the shape of a lion's head. How he glittered!""</p>
  
  <p>""This is well known,"" the king complained.</p>
  
  <p>""I was still mounted. I rode the length of the hall in silence, between the long rows of dragon skulls. It felt as though they were watching me, somehow. I stopped in front of the throne, looking up at him. His golden sword was across his legs, <strong>its edge red with a king's blood</strong>. My men were filling the room behind me. Lannister's men drew back. I never said a word. I looked at him seated there on the throne, and I waited. <strong>At last Jaime laughed and got up.</strong> He took off his helm, and he said to me, 'Have no fear, Stark. I was only keeping it warm for our friend Robert. It's not a very comfortable seat, I'm afraid.'""</p>
  
  <p>The king threw back his head and roared. His laughter startled a flight of crows from the tall brown grass. They took to the air in a wild beating of wings. ""You think I should mistrust Lannister because he sat on my throne for a few moments?"" He shook with laughter again. ""Jaime was all of seventeen, Ned. Scarce more than a boy.""</p>
  
  <p><strong>""Boy or man, he had no right to that throne.""</strong></p>
  
  <p><sup>ibid</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Gregor Clegane</h3>

<p>It can be argued Ned has never really made common cause with Gregor but he has rode alongside him and been forced to put up with him due to their common allegiance with the Lannisters. Ned appeared to dislike and distrust Gregor and even put some belief into the rumours over the knight and that he was the one to kill Elia and the babes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unlike his brother, Ser Gregor did not live at court. He was a solitary man who seldom left his own lands, but for wars and tourneys. He had been with Lord Tywin when King's Landing fell, a new-made knight of seventeen years, even then distinguished by his size and his implacable ferocity. <strong>Some said it had been Gregor who'd dashed the skull of the infant prince Aegon Targaryen against a wall, and whispered that afterward he had raped the mother, the Dornish princess Elia, before putting her to the sword.</strong> These things were not said in Gregor's hearing.</p>
  
  <p>Ned Stark could not recall ever speaking to the man, though Gregor had ridden with them during Balon Greyjoy's rebellion, one knight among thousands. He watched him with disquiet. <strong>Ned seldom put much stock in gossip, but the things said of Ser Gregor were more than ominous.</strong> He was soon to be married for the third time, and one heard dark whisperings about the deaths of his first two wives. It was said that his keep was a grim place where servants disappeared unaccountably and even the dogs were afraid to enter the hall. And there had been a sister who had died young under queer circumstances, and the fire that had disfigured his brother, and the hunting accident that had killed their father. Gregor had inherited the keep, the gold, and the family estates. His younger brother Sandor had left the same day to take service with the Lannisters as a sworn sword, and it was said that he had never returned, not even to visit.</p>
  
  <p><sup>A Game of Thrones, Eddard VII</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Roose Bolton</h3>

<p>I am mentioning Roose here because he's mentioned in the question and there's a slim chance it his him but I highly doubt it. In fact I'm pretty sure it isn't supposed to be him.</p>

<p>The Stark's and the Bolton's have been in conflict with each other for about as long as there have been Stark's and Bolton's. So you'd assume this would be a likely candidate and the two have had to kiss and make up for Robert's Rebellion, the Greyjoy Rebellion and in most day to day running's of the North.</p>

<p>However, the only mention of Roose, or any Bolton for that matter, in eddard's chapters is the following. It's not a positive thought of Ned's though.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Mercy is never a mistake, Lord Renly,"" Ned replied. ""On the Trident, Ser Barristan here cut down a dozen good men, Robert's friends and mine. When they brought him to us, grievously wounded and near death, <strong>Roose Bolton urged us to cut his throat</strong>, but your brother said, 'I will not kill a man for loyalty, nor for fighting well,' and sent his own maester to tend Ser Barristan's wounds."" He gave the king a long cool look. ""Would that man were here today.""</p>
  
  <p><sup>A Game of Thrones, Eddard VIII</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Rhaegar Targaryen is mentioned in the question so I'll address him here but I don't think Ned despised him. In fact most of his recollections of Rhaegar actually appear to be quite positive, for example...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There was no answer Ned Stark could give to that but a frown. For the first time in years, he found himself remembering Rhaegar Targaryen. He wondered if Rhaegar had frequented brothels; somehow he thought not.</p>
  
  <p><sup>A Game of Thrones, Eddard IX</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In fact from seeing Rhaegar give Lyanna the queen of beauty's laurel instead of his own wife and knowing about their relationship. Even going as far as to</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> look after Jon and hide him away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's likely that Ned had some respect for the man and probably didn't despise him just out of respect for Lyanna.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robert had been jesting with Jon and old Lord Hunter as the prince circled the field after unhorsing Ser Barristan in the final tilt to claim the champion's crown. Ned remembered the moment when all the smiles died, when Prince Rhaegar Targaryen urged his horse past his own wife, the Dornish princess Elia Martell, to lay the queen of beauty's laurel in Lyanna's lap. He could see it still: a crown of winter roses, blue as frost.</p>

"84004","Did anyone beside Ned and Howland Reed survive at the Tower of Joy?","<p>I always thought Ned and Howland were the only survivors at the events at the Tower of Joy.</p>

<p>But at my current rereading I found something which might indicate there was someone else:<br>
From the first Eddard chapter in A Game of Thrones:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ned remembered the way she [Lyanna] had smiled then, how tightly her fingers had clutched his as she gave up her hold on life, rose petals spilling from her palm, dead and black. After that he remembered nothing. <strong>They</strong> had found him still holding her body, silent with grief.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who does <strong>They</strong> refer to if only Howland was there?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","84039","<p>The ""they"" probably refers to Eddard's men. We don't have anywhere near a full accounting of what happened, but the fact that Eddard arrived with only a few men instead of a whole army tells us that the assault on the Tower of Joy was an impromptu one. Perhaps Eddard got wind of Lyanna's whereabouts and set off immediately with whatever friends he had at hand, ordering a more well armed accompaniment to follow them later? A noble household is rarely without servants, so perhaps it was the servants who found them? Either way, we know from Eddard himself that all of those who clashed at the Tower of Joy, save for Eddard and Howland, perished that day. </p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","222912","<p>Olenna Tyrell did the deed but it was planned along with Littlefinger and Ser Dontos was involved in making sure things went smoothly, not that he knew.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But if it wasn’t the Kettleblacks and it wasn’t Ser Dontos... you weren’t even in the city, and it couldn’t have been Tyrion...”</p>
<p>“No more guesses, sweetling?”</p>

<p>Petyr smiled. “I will wager you that at some point during the evening someone told you that your hair net was crooked and straightened it for you.”</p>
<p>Sansa raised a hand to her mouth. “You cannot mean... she wanted to take me to Highgarden, to marry me to her grandson...”</p>
<p>“Gentle, pious, good-hearted Willas Tyrell. Be grateful you were spared, he would have bored you spitless. The old woman is not boring, though, I’ll grant her that. A fearsome old harridan, and not near as frail as she pretends. When I came to Highgarden to dicker for Margaery’s hand, she let her lord son bluster while she asked pointed questions about Joffrey’s nature. I praised him to the skies, to be sure... whilst my men spread disturbing tales amongst Lord Tyrell’s servants. That is how the game is played.</p>
<p>“I also planted the notion of Ser Loras taking the white. Not that I suggested it, that would have been too crude. But men in my party supplied grisly tales about how the mob had killed Ser Preston Greenfield and raped the Lady Lollys, and slipped a few silvers to Lord Tyrell’s army of singers to sing of Ryam Redwyne, Serwyn of the Mirror Shield, and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight. A harp can be as dangerous as a sword, in the right hands.</p>
<p>“Mace Tyrell actually thought it was his own idea to make Ser Loras’s inclusion in the Kingsguard part of the marriage contract. Who better to protect his daughter than her splendid knightly brother? And it relieved him of the difficult task of trying to find lands and a bride for a third son, never easy, and doubly difficult in Ser Loras’s case.</p>
<p>“Be that as it may. Lady Olenna was not about to let Joff harm her precious darling granddaughter, but unlike her son she also realized that under all his flowers and finery, Ser Loras is as hot-tempered as Jaime Lannister. Toss Joffrey, Margaery, and Loras in a pot, and you’ve got the makings for kingslayer stew. The old woman understood something else as well. Her son was determined to make Margaery a queen, and for that he needed a king... but he did not need Joffrey. We shall have another wedding soon, wait and see. Margaery will marry Tommen. She’ll keep her queenly crown and her maidenhead, neither of which she especially wants, but what does that matter? The great western alliance will be preserved... for a time, at least.”</p>

"15616","What is Petyr Baelish's endgame with Sansa?","<p><strong>This question and related answers contain some serious spoilers from books 3 to 5. Littlefinger's <em>endgame</em> would be something only a person having read those books would understand.</strong></p>

<p>I'm re-reading ASoIaF, but I've only just finished AGoT and I'm specifically looking for evidence regarding Petyr Baelish and Sansa Stark.  I do not believe that he whisked her away to the Eyrie without some kind of plan.  I've been doing a little bit of digging around as to thoughts on Littlefinger's plans regarding Sansa.  <a href=""http://towerofthehand.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">The Tower of the Hand</a> has some interesting thoughts, but it doesn't appear that anything has been discussed since before ADWD was published.</p>

<p>I have my own thoughts.  I believe that once things settle down in the Seven Kingdoms again and it's safe to reveal Sansa's true identity, he's going to try to marry Sansa and take control of Harrenhal, Winterfell, and possibly the Vale in addition to his lordship of the Fingers.  Pretty much everyone believes that all the male Starks are dead leaving Sansa as the sole heir of Winterfell.  In addition to that, he'll get Sansa who is apparently a dead-ringer for Catelyn and go on to fulfill all his Catelyn fantasies.  </p>

<p>I'm really partial to this theory.  Can anyone shoot holes in it for me or offer up alternative theories?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","15624","<p>I think it is somewhat thin that Littlefinger should be able to secure a betrothal for his illegitimate daughter to the heir to the Eyrie. IIRC there was some explanation for that regarding money, which is a little bit weak. However...</p>

<p>dianod is correct in that Littlefinger stated his plan to Sansa in AFFC, and it is a solid plan. Not without cost, though, as it would alienate any remaining Lannisters. The gain would be considerable, as he would gain a firm hold of the north through Sansa, a somewhat less firm hold of the Vale through Harry, and a yet again somewhat less firm hold of the Riverlands through his own Lordship of Harrenhal.</p>

<p>Is it his true plan? It does seem so, but with Littlefinger, who knows. </p>

<p>Would that be his endgame? To paraphrase Littlefinger himself, to know how to move a piece, you have to know what motivates them. Littlefinger seems to be callous and egocentric, but it is implied that he is strongly motivated by his love of Catelyn. With Catelyn dead (or undead, as it turns out) he has shifted his desires to Sansa, but the question is if that is something he would have counted on in his long con. I think not.</p>

<p>Remember that this whole mess was started by him. He is literally the spider in the middle of the whole Lannister-Stark web. He made Lysa poison Jon Arryn and send a letter to Catelyn, thereby triggering all the events that lead to war. Littlefinger thrives on chaos, but I highly doubt he could have hoped to win Catelyn, even if Ned died. I somehow do not have the impression that he knew of Sansa beforehand, but rather noticed her when she came to King's Landing with Ned. So, if not love of Catelyn/Sansa, what then?</p>

<p>Is it power he lusts for? It may be. Although he was already fairly high up in power from the start: treasurer and member of the small council is perhaps one of the highest offices in Westeros. As someone (Tyrion?) said, though, <em>Why would a man with a pot of gold want another?</em> Perhaps, but I think there is more.</p>

<p>Littlefinger comes from a (somewhat) humble background, being the son of a minor lord. He is short, does not inspire love or loyalty or trust (except in Lysa, who he deceived and murdered). People (rightly) consider him sleazy and untrustworthy. His biggest love Catelyn spurned him, and he was humiliated by Brandon Stark. I believe Littlefinger wants to win and be acclaimed hero, and win the love of the people, the respect of honourable lords and the love of women (Sansa, perhaps). And also in the meantime, get some revenge on people and houses who he feels have wronged him. In short, I think he wants real love and respect.</p>

<p>It feels like a logical plan from his side. He tried to fight Brandon, but swords are not his best game. He plays the game of thrones. So he sets the kingdom up for chaos and then puts it back together again, and is (possibly) celebrated as a great hero. </p>

<p>I believe, though, that in Sansa, he will have met his match. I do not think she will be as accommodating to him as he thinks. But that's another story. It is interesting to note, however, that Sansa is not yet aware that Littlefinger betrayed Ned. She will be told by someone, I am sure, and I wonder how he will try to fix that. He should realize that this knowledge will forever alienate Sansa.</p>

<p>I also remember some people having theories on Littlefinger having some plans for Daenerys' return. By his own statement, he stopped the small council from hiring a faceless man to kill her, and also he has worked on similar goals as Varys: causing chaos, setting houses against each other. If this was the case, he would have done more for Dany than Varys and Illyrio in securing half the kingdom before she even lands. But seeing as he scarcely seems interested in Dany, or is mentioned in any such connections (unlike Varys and Illyrio), it does not seem likely. Interesting, though, and food for speculation as to what he will make of Aegon's army, and Dany when/if she comes to Westeros on Drogon's back.</p>

No spoilers if you can help it.</p>

<p>One thing I don't understand is that after Joffrey beheaded Ned Stark and proves himself to be a terrible king (and his mother Cersei unable to control him), Tywin Lannister sends Tyrion to King's Landing to be Hand of the King.</p>

<p>Of course Tyrion is his son, but Tyrion is obviously not his favorite. So why doesn't Tywin just send himself to be Hand of the King, and instead, prefer to stay at the ruined castle Harrenhal?</p>

<p>Is this decision explained anywhere in the book or in the TV series?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","223111","<p>It's explained in the very episode why Tyrion was sent, because he is family, Tywin's son. And of course he can't send Jaime because he's been captured. Note both Tywin's and Tyrion's first comments in the quote below. Tywin has realised Tyrion is quite good at ruling and King's Landing needs a good ruler at the moment. Tyrion's comment about strategy is also quite telling. He himself isn't the best at it so he wouldn't make much use in battle but Tywin is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tywin Lannister:</strong> They have my son! Get out, all of you. (to Tyrion) Not you. You were right about Eddard Stark. If he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Robert's brothers. But now – madness. Madness and stupidity. I always thought you were a stunted fool. Perhaps I was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Tyrion Lannister:</strong> Half wrong. I'm new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here.</p>
<p><strong>Tywin Lannister:</strong> No one will stay here. Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the Riverland on fire from God's Eye to the Red Fork. The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal. And you will go to King's Landing.</p>
<p><strong>Tyrion Lannister:</strong> And do what?</p>
<p><strong>Tywin Lannister:</strong> Rule. You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead. You will bring that boy king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be. And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest – Baelish, Varys, Pycelle…</p>
<p><strong>Tyrion Lannister:</strong> Heads, spikes, walls. Why not my uncle? Why not anyone? Why me?</p>
<p><strong>Tywin Lannister:</strong> You're my son.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that Tywin <em>is</em> Hand of the King at that moment in time. However, he is too busy at war to go back and lead at King's Landing. He was playing to the strengths of his family, Tyrion ruling and himself fighting and being a strategist.</p>
<p>Tyrion's thoughts on the matter are elaborated on a bit more in this scene. He sends Tyrion, and not an uncle of someone else, because Tywin has given up on Jaime. That means Tyrion is now his only son, in his head, and so he needs to rely on him more to carry on House Lannister.</p>

<p>&quot;More than you know, Father,&quot; Tyrion answered quietly. He finished his wine and set the cup aside, thoughtful. A part of him was more pleased than he cared to admit. Another part was remembering the battle upriver, and wondering if he was being sent to hold the left again. &quot;Why me?&quot; he asked, cocking his head to one side. &quot;Why not my uncle? Why not Ser Addam or Ser Flement or Lord Serrett? Why not a … bigger man?&quot;</p>
<p>Lord Tywin rose abruptly. &quot;You are my son.&quot;</p>
<p>That was when he knew. You have given him up for lost, he thought. You bloody bastard, you think Jaime's good as dead, so I'm all you have left. Tyrion wanted to slap him, to spit in his face, to draw his dagger and cut the heart out of him and see if it was made of old hard gold, the way the smallfolks said. Yet he sat there, silent and still.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> When Renly is killed, she cries for him as if he was her father, and she wants to avenge him.</p>

<p>What did Renly to earn such admiration from her?</p>

<p>However, Renly always treated her kindly.  </p>

<p>It is revealed in <em>A Storm of Swords</em> that she first met Renly as a teen, and was smitten with him at first sight:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Renly Baratheon had been more than a king to her. She had loved him since first 
  he came to Tarth on his leisurely lord’s progress, to mark his coming of age. Her father 
  welcomed him with a feast and commanded her to attend; elsewise she would have hidden in her 
  room like some wounded beast. She had been no older than Sansa, more afraid of sniggers than 
  of swords. They will know about the rose, she told Lord Selwyn, they will laugh at me. But the 
  Evenstar would not relent. </p>
  
  <p>And Renly Baratheon had shown her every courtesy, as if she were a proper maid, and pretty. 
  He even danced with her, and in his arms she’d felt graceful, and her feet had floated across the 
  floor. Later others begged a dance of her, because of his example. From that day forth, she 
  wanted only to be close to Lord Renly, to serve him and protect him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even after that, during <em>A Clash of Kings</em> once she joined him in his bid for the kingdom, he accepted her on her own merits, and bestowed upon her the highest honor she could have hoped for: he made her one of his own personal guards.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Your Grace,” Brienne answered, “I ask the honor of a place among your Rainbow Guard. I 
  would be one of your seven, and pledge my life to yours, to go where you go, ride at your side, 
  and keep you safe from all hurt and harm.” </p>
  
  <p>“Done,” he said. “Rise, and remove your helm.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From her reaction, it is obvious just how much this means to her:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And yet, when Renly cut away her torn cloak and fastened a rainbow in its place, Brienne of 
  Tarth did not look unfortunate. Her smile lit up her face, and her voice was strong and proud as 
  she said, “My life for yours, Your Grace. From this day on, I am your shield, I swear it by the old 
  gods and the new.” The way she looked at the king-looked down at him, she was a good hand 
  higher, though Renly was near as tall as his brother had been-was painful to see.</p>

And more generally how could the houses have a history together given Ned's honor and Bolton's cruelty?</p>

  <p>Yet <strong>the bitterest foes of Winterfell were undoubtedly the Red Kings of
  the Dreadfort, those grim lords of House Bolton</strong> whose domains of old
  stretched from the Last River to the White Knife, and as far south as
  the Sheepshead Hills.</p>
  
  <p><strong>The enmity between the Starks and Boltons went back to the Long Night
  itself, it is claimed</strong>. The wars between these two ancient families
  were legion, and not all ended in victory for House Stark. King Royce
  Bolton, Second of His Name, is said to have taken and burned
  Winterfell itself; his namesake and descendant Royce IV (remembered by
  history as Royce Redarm, for his habit of plunging his arm into the
  bellies of captive foes to pull out their entrails with his bare hand)
  did the same three centuries later. <strong>Other Red Kings were reputed to
  wear cloaks made from the skins of Stark princes they had captured and
  flayed.</strong></p>
  
  <p><strong>Yet in the end, even the Dreadfort fell before the might of
  Winterfell, and the last Red King, known to history as Rogar the
  Huntsman, swore fealty to the King of Winter and sent his sons to
  Winterfell as hostages</strong>, even as the first Andals were crossing the
  narrow sea in their longships.</p>
  
  <p>After the defeat of the Boltons, the last of their Northern rivals,
  the greatest threats to the dominion of House Stark came by sea.</p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <p>Crossing the narrow sea in their hundreds and thousands, the longships
  of the Andals made landings in the North just as they did to the
  south, but wherever they came ashore, the Starks and their bannermen
  fell upon them and drove them back into the sea. <strong>King Theon Stark,
  known to history as the Hungry Wolf, turned back the greatest of these
  threats, making common cause with the Boltons to smash the Andal

Surely she can't blame Shireen for her face, which - as the result of getting Greyscale as an infant - is no fault of her own OR the child's. Stannis himself doesn't appear to bear the child any ill will.</p>

<p>The only thing I can figure is that Shireen is a reminder of her failure to provide Stannis with a son, something that he desperately wanted. Is this the case?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","84885","<p>Selyes Florent is very unhappy with her life, largely because of her marriage to Stannis.

<p>Stannis, in general, is not a depicted as a very loving or emotionally supportive person. One thing he did hope for (and expect) from his wife was to give him a male heir. Instead, she only managed to have one child, Shireen; even that baby was ""cursed"" at a very young age with greyscale.</p>

<p>At this point, Selyse looks at Shireen as a representation of everything that is wrong with her life:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Melara_Hetherspoon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Melara Hetherspoon</a> fell or was pushed into a well at night time, some time after visiting <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Maggy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Maggy</a> The Frog's tent. </li>
<li>She died in that well. </li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Cersei_Lannister"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cersei Lannister</a> was present at both locations.</li>
<li>Melara revealed that she had feelings for <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jaime_Lannister"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Jaime Lannister</a> during the visit to Maggy's tent.</li>
<li><p>Cersei claims that Melara ""fell"" into the well; which is something she only does when she is speaking about the incident to a third party.</p>

<p>To Lady Taena:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Joffrey had never had a close friend of his own age, that she recalled. The poor boy was always alone. I had Jaime when I was a child . . . and Melara, until <strong>she fell into the well</strong>.<br /><sup><em>-A Song of Ice and Fire - Book Four: A Feast for Crows, Chapter Twenty-Eight (<a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Feast_for_Crows-Chapter_28"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cersei VI</a>).</em></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and to Qyburn:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""This maegi made certain prophecies. I laughed at them at first, but . . . she foretold the death of one of my bedmaids. At the time she made the prophecy, the girl was one-and-ten, healthy as a little horse and safe within the Rock. Yet <strong>she soon fell down a well</strong> and drowned.<br /><sup><em>-A Song of Ice and Fire - Book Four: A Feast for Crows, Chapter Thirty-Six (<a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Feast_for_Crows-Chapter_36"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cersei VIII</a>).</em></sup></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Cersei remembers Melara's final look as an ""accusing one""</p>

<p>(during her walk of Atonement)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A young girl sat beneath a fountain, drenched in spray, and stared at her with Melara Hetherspoon's accusing eyes.<br /><sup><em>-A Song of Ice and Fire - Book Five: A Dance With Dragons, Chapter Sixty-Five (<a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Dance_with_Dragons-Chapter_65"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cersei II</a>).</em></sup></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Maggy told Melara what seems to allude to Cersei being the cause of her death:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Not Jaime, nor any other man,” said Maggy. “Worms will have your maidenhead. Your death is here tonight, little one. Can you smell <strong>her</strong> breath? <strong>She</strong> is very close.”<br /><sup><em>-A Song of Ice and Fire - Book Four: A Feast for Crows, Chapter Twelve (<a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Feast_for_Crows-Chapter_12"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cersei III</a>).</em></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>There has never been a time within the entire series where ""death"" has been referred to as a ""she"". Sure, The Seven are in fact One, meaning that the ""Mother"" and the ""Crone"" are synonymous with the ""Stranger"", but in this case it's too specific.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Means</h2>

<p>Melara was not a large person, given the correct bump, Cersei could have feasibly pushed her into the well. Additionally, if the fall was in fact an accident, it's entirely possible that Cersei was able to either stifle or ignore any cries for help from Melara.</p>

<p>In fact, Melara <em>did</em> shout</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She could still hear Melara Hetherspoon insisting that if they never spoke about the prophecies, they would not come true. She was not so silent in the well, though. She screamed and shouted.<br /><sup><em>-A Song of Ice and Fire - Book Four: A Feast for Crows, Chapter Thirty-Nine (<a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Feast_for_Crows-Chapter_39"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cersei IX</a>).</em></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It can be assumed that Melara drowned once fallen into the well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cersei had not had a friend she so enjoyed since Melara Hetherspoon, and Melara had turned out to be a greedy little schemer with ideas above her station. I should not think ill of her. She's dead and drowned, and she taught me never to trust anyone but Jaime.<br /><sup><em>-A Song of Ice and Fire - Book Four: A Feast for Crows, Chapter Twenty-Four (<a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Feast_for_Crows-Chapter_24"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cersei V</a>).</em></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So all Cersei had to do was, nothing.</p>

<h2>Motive</h2> 

<p>It is widely established that Cersei Lannister believed that her and her twin brother, Jaime Lannister, were ""meant for each other"". She was very possessive over him. So once she found out that Melara had feelings for Jaime, she became distrustful and vengeful towards Melara:<br>
(at Maggy's)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I get three questions too,"" her friend insisted. And when Cersei tugged upon her arm, she wriggled free and turned back to the crone. ""Will I marry Jaime?"" she [Melara] blurted out.<br />
  You stupid girl, the queen thought, angry even now. Jaime does not even know you are alive. Back then her brother lived only for swords and dogs and horses... and for her, his twin.<br /><sup><em>-A Song of Ice and Fire - Book Four: A Feast for Crows, Chapter Twelve (<a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Feast_for_Crows-Chapter_12"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cersei III</a>).</em></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Opportunity</h2>

<p>Cersei Lannister and Melara Hetherspoon were close friends and spent a lot of time together whilst growing up. Cersei, being born into privilege was free to move in any direction she pleased, even at night.</p>

<p>Additionally, being that the pair were presently attending the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tournament_in_honor_of_Viserys%27s_birth"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tourney for Viserys</a>, and their parents being pre-occupied with the major events, they would not have been under constant supervision.</p>

<p>Clearly then Pycelle understood that Ned was about to discover the same truth. <strong>So why didn't he lie about what Jon was doing?</strong></p>

<p>I understand that he wants to keep his true allegiance a secret, but he could have just been less helpful to Ned or feigned ignorance about what Jon was doing before he died.</p>

<p>Pycelle had no choice but to feed accurate information to Ned. If he lied in some way that Ned's sister-in-law could contradict, he would have outed himself as a conspirator. The only publicly known information about Jon Arryn's last days is that:</p>

<p>a) he poured over a book from Pycelle<br><br>
b) he visited a bunch of unspecified locations, so that's all Pycelle told him.</p>

<p>And it's worth noting that the only information Pycelle gives Ned that's of any use is basically useless on its own.

<p>I recently started watching the Game of Thrones TV Series and enjoyed it very much. Only later did I find out that it was based on a series of books, which is good news, since I really enjoy reading. I already watched the complete first season, and am halfway through the second. What I would like to know is if there are major plot differences between the series and the books, or if, having seen the first season, I should skip the first book or something. Or if, even though there are not many differences, the book is still worth reading because it is more intense and adds more to the plot or something like this (I'm guessing this should be the right choice).</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

<p>P.S.: Don't get me wrong, I know books are almost always much better than TV Series or Movies (even though some may be very good adaptations). I just want to know the opinion of people who have both read and watched the Series.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><adaptation-comparison>","16822","<p>I have read the first 4 books a few years ago. After watching the first season (and before the second), I re-read the first 2 books.
In the first season they worked hard to keep the series as close as possible to the books. In the 2nd season, I feel that they deviated too much from the books, and altered some of the events, so the story is different in some areas. I am not talking about short-cuts that are a necessity when moving from a book to a TV series, but of more profound changes.</p>

<p>Just to name a few:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> In the books Aria never meets Tywin Lannister, and so does Littlefinger.
 John Snow's story is different from what is shown in the series.
 Osha doesn't tempt a sleep with Theon in the books.
 The whole scene with Joffery's entourage being attacked after seeing off Marcella, is different, and specifically Sansa Stark doesn't undergo an attempted rape.</p>

<p>In my eyes these changes (and others) are significant and alter the story and our understanding of the characters. It seems that they've made the series much more sexual (not that the books are not) to appeal to the audience.</p>

""Joffrey"" and ""Robb"" (a simple diminutive of ""Robert"") are first names that have become surnames over the past seven or so centuries, and one can find many people with these names.  There was an aristocratic Joffrey family in Vevey, Switzerland from the 15th to the 18th centuries, for example.</li>

<p>As you have seen, plenty have used these real world archaisms.  I add one more to follow on from Nate Wells' answer: James Tiptree Jr. who used gender-neutral ""Ser"" and ""Myr"".  In <em>Brightness Falls from the Air</em> the appendix says:<blockquote><strong>Myr, Myrrin</strong>: Myr serves for Mr., Mrs., Ms., or Miss and is often prefixed affectionately or jokingly to a person's first name or nickname. Myrrin is the plural, corresponding to ""Ladies and Gentlemen"".</blockquote></p>

<p>And a character insists upon being called ""Ser"" instead of ""Myr"", just as some people in the real world insist upon being a ""Sir"" when called ""Mister"":<blockquote><p> ""And then you are Myr … ?"" Kip addresses the taciturn man. <p> ""<em>Ser</em> Xe Vovoka,"" the stranger corrects him. […] <p> Kip recalls that ""Ser"" is a technical honorific, somewhere beyond ""Doctor"".

"85750","Who put Joffrey up to what he did at Ned's trial?","<p>It seemed to me that someone must have put Joffrey up to </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> beheading Ned Stark.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After the trial all someone would have had to do is ask Joffrey who advised him to that and they would have known who was pulling strings behind them in a way that is against their plans.  The obvious guess is Littlefinger, but you can't think he's dumb enough to think Catelyn wouldn't ever find out.</p>

<p>Does anyone know why Joffrey did that when everyone around him had another plan and thought he was aligned with it.</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","85795","<p><strong>Littlefinger's plot</strong></p>

<p>Littlefinger plotted to get Ned Stark to King's Landing, as explained in A Storm Of Swords ...</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Petyr made Lysa Arryn write the letter, which forced Ned to investigate Jon Arryns death. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then he used Ned's overly faithful character to turn him against the Lannisters by telling him their little secret. Finally he made sure that the Gold Cloaks would be ready to take him into custody.</p>

<p>Therefore it's mainly Littlefinger's guilt, but there is no evidence (yet), that he actively manipulated Joffrey.</p>

<p>At this time war already begun, Robb Stark was marching south and Jaime Lannister was taken captive, thus starting war couldn't be a reason. Besides that Joffrey was known to be cruel and volatile and didn't need much reason ...</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> to kill someone as he proved many times.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What about the conversation between Tyrion and Varys?</strong></p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> “Who truly killed Eddard Sark, do you think? Joffrey, who gave the command? Ser Ilyn Payne, who swung the sword? Or… another?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tyrion cocked his head sideways. “Did you mean to answer your damned riddle, or only to make my head ache worse?”</p>
  
  <p>Varys smiled. “Here, then. Power resides where men believe it resides. No more and no less… A shadow on the wall, yet shadows can kill. And ofttimes a very small man can cast a very large shadow.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Varys loves philosophical discussion like this one. He's telling that Ned Stark wasn't killed by a single man. Joffrey gave the command, Ilyn Payne executed it, but this all was only possible because most people believe that a king has power. Without that belief soldiers would put down their swords and Joffrey would just be a little kid.</p>

<p>The ""small man"" he refers to was probably meant to be multiple people. For one Joffrey is only a boy, therefore he's the most likely subject. But as he's talking to ""the Imp"" it could also be meant to motivate Tyrion.</p>

<p>Interpreting this conversation as proof that Littlefinger put Joffrey up to it, is very far-fetched.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> </p>

<p>Probably Joffrey just did it out of the blue clear sky.</p>

"85766","Why did King Robb not return to the North via the alternate route through the Bay of Crabs?","<p>After his conquests in the Westerlands when King Robb returns to Riverrun, his first priority was retaking the North from Iron Islanders. His marriage to Jeyne Westerling had alienated the Freys and matters were further complicated by the treasonous murders committed by Karstarks. His passage to The North via The Twins was in peril. </p>

<p><strong>As per Catelyn Chapter III in ASoS he was actively exploring alternate routes to go North</strong>, including through the Bloody Gate of Vale:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Robb:</strong> I've asked only that she (<em>Lysa Arryn</em>) open the Bloody Gate for us, and provide ships at Gulltown to take us north. The high road would be hard, but not so hard as fighting our way up the Neck. If I could land at White Harbor I could flank Moat Cailin and drive the ironmen from the North in half a year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>He was spending a lot of time brooding over the maps.</strong> 
Why did not he or any of his counsellors think of the following route:</p>

<ol>
<li>Follow the Red Fork from Riverrun to Darry.</li>
<li>Reach White Harbour from the Bay of Crabs.</li>
<li>Flank Moat Cailin from the rear and retake rest of the North.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QHsHz.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Admittedly, it would have been a long sea journey and the only show stopper I can think of could be lack of sea-faring vessels at his disposal. But he only needed ships to carry his men and not war-ships. Certainly, the naval prowess of Riverlands at his disposal was sufficient for this voyage?</p>

<p>PS : I am still in the middle of ASoS, so beg your pardon if there is a reference of this option (and reasons it was not feasible) in subsequent chapters.</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","85773","<p>I think there are two things that you are overlooking.</p>

<p>The first is that the Lannister army could have easily cut them off. Having an entire army move anywhere is a slow and laborious prospect. The Lannisters would have known where the Stark army was moving (through spies etc.), and moved their own army to cut them off. Then the Starks would have had to contend with the Lannisters, something they did not want to do at all.</p>

<p>Even the risk of this would be enough to discourage Robb and his advisers, they would not want to potentially fight through an entire army, only to then go and fight another, their forces would be decimated. In order to retake the North they needed as many men as possible.</p>

<p>The reason they wanted to go through the Vale and depart from Gulltown would have been to avoid any confrontation with the Lannisters. This would be via land or sea, as departing from the Saltpans would mean a much longer sea journey, and the Lannisters backed up with ships from Highgarden could also have intercepted them easily.</p>

<p>Secondly, there are the logistics of such movements. Having to move an army across the country from west to east, then carry them across the sea, all whilst keeping them fed, and also transporting all of their weapons etc. is very costly. I'm not sure if it's explicitly stated where any ships from the Riverlands might be, but they might not all be able to reach the eastern shore to transport them.</p>

<p>This would mean hiring civilian vessels, most likely merchant ships, to transport troops. Those ships  would not doing any trading at this time, so they would have to be compensated for that, even if they do agree to take them. Hiring individual ships to do this would be ridiculously costly, and the Starks had already spent a lot of money on this war.</p>

<p>Then the merchant ships would have to make a journey they possibly haven't made before. And it's not like they would be an organized force, hiring merchant ships might mean that some troops arrive there in 2 weeks, and some in 2 months. They would then have to regroup and only then could they attack Moat Cailin.</p>

<p>It's also unlikely Robb or the Stark bannermen would have chosen to trust civilian vessels to carry large chunks of their army overseas.</p>

"17093","What planet does Game of Thrones happen on?","<p>There are three problems with the setting of <em>Game of Thrones</em>: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Because if the continent of Westeros in the show (and books) are probably set on either a parallel Earth or a very Earth-like alien world. </p></li>
<li><p>But the problem is that we find out that there are roughly forty years of winter for every ten years of summer (it could be more or less) so this planet is obviously not Earth because it must have a very different orbit to our world. It obviously takes fifty Earth years to orbit their sun and the planet is only positioned for summer for a short period of that time. </p></li>
<li><p>But we see in the opening credits that Westeros is inside the shell of a planet and at the centre is their large mechanical artificial sun, I don't think the opening credits of the show show us what is literally happening, I think it's an artists representation, so it's good to bear this point in mind but safe to ignore it. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>So any ideas? </p>

<hr>

<p>I believe I have confused some people with this question, first of all the story tells us something along the lines of ""The summers last years and the winters last lifetimes!"" I'm not sure what the exact wording is, but whether the tilt of the planet or the distance from the sun or the atmosphere is responsible is irrelevant, I think we can agree that it's not Earth or at least not our version of Earth. </p>

<p>What I was hoping for was a little specific info on what this planet is for example, Lord of the Rings happens in a lost age in Europe, back when Elves, Hobbits and Dwarves shared the world with man, so we know Middle Earth, is Earth. Also we know Masters of the Universe happens on Eternia, Transformers happens on Earth and Cybertron so what planet does Game of Thrones happen on? </p>

<p>In A Feast for Crows, Chapter 5 Samwell Tarly tells Jon Snow that he found one account of the Long Night that spoke of the last hero slaying Others with a blade of dragonsteel and they could not stand against it and Jon wonders if dragonsteel refers to Valyrian steel.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“What about the Others?”</p>
  
  <p>“I found mention of dragonglass. The children of the forest used to give the Night’s Watch a
  hundred obsidian daggers every year, during the Age of Heroes. The Others come when it is
  cold, most of the tales agree. Or else it gets cold when they come. Sometimes they appear during
  snowstorms and melt away when the skies clear. They hide from the light of the sun and emerge
  by night... or else night falls when they emerge. Some stories speak of them riding the corpses of
  dead animals. Bears, direwolves, mammoths, horses, it makes no matter, so long as the beast is
  dead. The one that killed Small Paul was riding a dead horse, so that part’s plainly true. Some
  accounts speak of giant ice spiders too. I don’t know what those are. Men who fall in battle
  against the Others must be burned, or else the dead will rise again as their thralls.”</p>
  
  <p>“We knew all this. The question is, how do we fight them?”</p>
  
  <p>“The armor of the Others is proof against most ordinary blades, if the tales can be believed,”
  said Sam, “and their own swords are so cold they shatter steel. Fire will dismay them, though,
  and they are vulnerable to obsidian.” He remembered the one he had faced in the haunted forest,
  and how it had seemed to melt away when he stabbed it with the dragonglass dagger Jon had
  made for him. “I found one account of the Long Night that spoke of <strong><em>the last hero slaying Others
  with a blade of dragonsteel</em></strong>. Supposedly they could not stand against it.”</p>
  
  <p>“Dragonsteel?” Jon frowned. “Valyrian steel?”</p>

<p>The creature is seemingly a very effective assassin. So why don't they create more of them (or make the one that already exists) kill other of enemies Stannis' like King Joffrey?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","17455","<p>Well, first off, they will use more shadows, so your question is premature. Not quite sure if that should be in a spoiler tag or not. I assume this is a question regarding the TV-show, and not the books.</p>

<p>Secondly, the shadows are costly to summon. Later on in the books, it is mentioned that Stannis seems drained and skeletal, and there are also other references, which I will not post here for their very spolerific nature. But suffice to say, it concerns people getting hurt to fuel Melisandre's magic.</p>

<p>Also, as we shall see, the shadows will not help Stannis as much as he would hope, because the majority of the lords and people are against him. So, combined with their high cost, they do not provide a real answer to his problems.</p>

<p>Besides those reasons, I think Stannis is a good guy, deep down inside. At first, I did not like him at all, but throughout the books, he is solid, honourable, harsh and grumpy, and it is hard not to like him when he scorns and scolds his sycophants, but praises Davos for telling the truth.</p>

<p><em>Either Cersei is lying to Cat in the 2nd episode about the ""little black-haired beauty"" who died in infancy, or Maggy was (wrong?)</em></p>

<p>The ""You win or you die"" scene in the eponymous episode (Season 1 episode 7) doesn't provide any hints. Cersei cops to all of her living children being Jaimie's, but neither confirms nor denies any dead children between her and Robert.</p>

<p>My best guess is that since it was Robert's custom to be away on a hunt during his wife's childbirth, Cersei killed the (born living) baby shortly after the birth. But that's just a guess since that would make her statements to Cat technically true, without entirely conflicting with Maggy's prophecy (Cersei felt no loss, and perhaps the baby wore no gold shroud).</p>

<p>I'm pretty certain that there haven't been any more hints in the show (see my new answer below for a correction on this). But I've only read about halfway through the books so far, and it's been a while. I easily could have missed something in what I have read.</p>

<p>So, any clues in the books that aren't in the show? Do the books tell more of the <em>""black-haired beauty""</em>?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","155807","<p>To complement Kevin's answer:</p>

<p>The whole conversation, as Kevin said, is a show-only thing. Cersei never gave birth to any child who may have been Robert's. </p>

<p>Eddard wondered the same, how did Cersei and Robert never have any Children?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""A dozen years,"" Ned said. ""<strong>How is it that you have had no children
  by the king?</strong>""</p>
  
  <p>She lifted her head, defiant. ""<strong>Your Robert got me with child
  once</strong>,"" she said, her voice thick with contempt. ""<strong>My brother found
  a woman to cleanse me. He never knew</strong>. If truth be told, I can
  scarcely bear for him to touch me, and I have not let him inside me
  for years. <strong>I know other ways to pleasure him, when he leaves his
  whores long enough to stagger up to my bedchamber</strong>. Whatever we do,
  <strong>the king is usually so drunk that he's forgotten it all by the next morning.</strong>""<br><sub><strong><em>AGOT: Eddard XII</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So as evident by Cersei's own confession:</p>

<ol>
<li>Robert only once managed to impregnate Cersei. </li>
<li>Cersei aborted the child with help of Jaime.</li>
<li>Robert never knew about this whole conception and abortion of his child. </li>
<li>Cersei employed other ways than intercourse to sate Robert.</li>
<li>Robert was usually too drunk to remember if he actually managed to have intercourse with his Queen or not. </li>
</ol>

<p>Later Cersei also thinks the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Ten thousand of your children perished in my palm</strong>, Your Grace, she thought, slipping a third finger into Myr. Whilst you snored, <strong>I
  would lick your sons off my face and fingers</strong> one by one, all those
  pale sticky princes. You claimed your rights, my lord, but <strong>in the
  darkness I would eat your heirs</strong>. <br><sub><strong><em>AFFC: Cersei
  VII</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Cersei says, She often used her hands and her mouth to get Robert off her case instead of letting him have intercourse with her. Due to these <em>methods</em> she never actually got pregnant with Robert's children except that one time, when she got it aborted. </p>

<p>So in conclusion, no there is no indication in the books about some Ravenhead kid who died after his birth. Only Children Cersei ever bore were Jaime's. Seems to be one of the many internal inconsistencies of the show.  </p>

<p>Whilst in Pentos, it is <strong>Illyrio</strong> who introduces <strong>Tyrion</strong> to their Targaryen alliance and ""plans""<sup><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Illyrio_Mopatis#A_Dance_with_Dragons"">[2]</a></sup>, <em>he</em> doesn't tell <strong>Tyrion</strong> of the full plans, but that may or may not have had anything to do with trust.</p>

<p><strong>To tell or not to tell</strong><br>
<strong>Tyrion</strong> at this point is a broken man. He has been convicted of Regicide (which he happens to not have committed), and is on the run since</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> committing Patricide.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He's also drowning in a sea of wine. He most definitely is not in the right mind, nor is he himself.</p>

<p>Whether or not <strong>Varys</strong> and <strong>Illyrio</strong> (Vallyrio) trust him when he his sober, is irrelevant, since <strong>Tyrion</strong> is not going to be of much help, let alone be trustworthy in his drunken stupor.</p>

<p><strong>Whet his appetite</strong><br>
You see, <strong>Tyrion</strong> has just lost his right to <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Casterly_Rock"">Casterly Rock</a>, and <strong>Illyrio</strong> offers him a chance to win it back; this gets Tyrion going<sup><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Illyrio_Mopatis#A_Dance_with_Dragons"">[3]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Once on his way, he slowly discovers that people aren't who they say they are and other mysteries, such as:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p><ul><li><strong>Duck</strong> turns out to be Ser <strong><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rolly_Duckfield"">Rolly Duckfield</a></strong></li><li><strong>Griff</strong> turns out to be Lord <strong><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jon_Connington"">Jon Connington</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lemore"">Septa Lemore</a></strong> has had a child previously? Intriguing...</li></ul></p>
</blockquote>

<p>this very much intrigues <strong>Tyrion</strong> and his curiosity; he just can't help trying to solve things and to prove his intellect. Finally he finds out that</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p><strong>Young Griff</strong> turns out to be <strong><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon_Targaryen_(son_of_Rhaegar)"">Aegon VI Targaryen</a></strong> (questionable, but that's a whole other kettle of fish).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>aaaaaaaand he's hooked!</p>

<p><strong>It's the journey, not the destination</strong><br>
So, Vallyrio are clever enough to know that <strong>Tyrion</strong> is an asset. He has proven his worth many times over:</p>

<ul>
<li>Successfully improving the cisterns and drainage at Casterly Rock<sup><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Casterly_Rock#History"">[4]</a></sup></li>
<li>Successfully evading the death penalty at the Eyrie<sup><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Eyrie#A_Game_of_Thrones"">[5]</a></sup></li>

</ul>

<p>Let alone all of his smaller triumphs. So they are ready to utilise him, and they know (especially <strong>Varys</strong> with his many one-on-one dealings with <strong>Tyrion</strong>) that he is very intelligent and capable of leading or at least advising the intendeds, <strong><em>but he has to be interested first!</em></strong> - hence the ""journey"" to discover the truth!</p>

"86296","Who supported the Targaryens during Robert's Rebellion?","<p>In <em>A Game Of Thrones</em> (I think, it may be one of the later books), Robert's Rebellion is briefly recapped and it is said that when Robert won, he stripped lands from those who opposed his claim during the rebellion.</p>

<p>In addition, there was the epic battle at the Trident where Rhaegar was killed by Robert.</p>

<p>Does it ever address in the books who supported the Targaryens during the war?</p>

<p>We know that the Vale (House Arryn), the Riverlands (House Tully) and the North (House Stark) supported the Stormlands (House Baratheon) in the rebellion, so from the seven kingdoms there are only the Westerlands (House Lannister), Highgarden (House Tyrell) and Dorne (House Martell) remaining.</p>

<hr>

<p>The rest here is not based on memory so let me know if it's incorrect.</p>

<p>From what I gathered, the Westerlands pretty much kept out of the war. They covertly supported the Throne (which is how Tywin managed to gain access to King's Landing when it was sacked), but I don't think they ever openly opposed the Rebellion in battle.</p>

<p>Dorne probably supported the Throne because Elia was married to Rhaegar at the time.</p>

<p>How about Highgarden? Was this ever addressed? Or did the Targaryens hire mercenaries (like the Golden Company or the Second Sons) to fight on their behalf?</p>

<p>It seems like 4 houses going up against 2 wouldn't be much of a battle. Obviously Robert won, but I assumed it was a close contest.</p>

"156091","How many Dornishman-jokes do we know?","<p>In Westeros, like our world, stereotypical and/or racist jokes are common. </p>

<p>Given the rivalry between Highgarden and Dorne, such jokes about Dornishmen seem to be particularly popular in the Reach<sup>1</sup>. </p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Joffrey should have met the Dornishmen himself, he reflected as he sat
  waiting, but he would have mucked it up, no doubt. Of late the king
  had been repeating little jests about the Dornish that he'd picked up
  from Mace Tyrell's men-at-arms. <strong>How many Dornishmen does it take to
  shoe a horse? Nine. One to do the shoeing, and eight to lift the horse
  up.</strong> Somehow Tyrion did not think Doran Martell would find that
  amusing.<br><sub>ASOS - Tyrion V</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is one manifestation of <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightBulbJoke"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lightbulb jokes</a> (Warning: TV Tropes link).</p>

<p>Do we know of any other Dornish jokes from ASOIAF Cannon sources?</p>

<hr>

<p><sub>1. A lot of Stereotypes are mainly about Dornishmen, not just the jocular ones. Like Anguy telling Arya that Dornishmen are all liars or Jon telling Ygritte that it is a saying that never Drink with Dornishmen when the moon is full (Whatever that means) etc.</sub></p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><trope>","156094","<p>I can only find one other proper Dornishman joke, of the genre you refer to, although the punchline is not revealed. From <em>A Storm of Swords</em>, ""Tyrion V"" (the same chapter your joke was from):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You want to die with a breast in hand, you said."" Tyrion cantered on ahead to where the ferry barges waited on the south bank of the Blackwater. He had suffered all he meant to suffer of what passed for Dornish wit. Father should have sent Joffrey after all. <strong>He could have asked Prince Oberyn if he knew how a Dornishman differed from a cowflop.</strong> That made him grin despite himself. He would have to make a point of being on hand when the Red Viper was presented to the king.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this is not <em>actually</em> a joke, but it refers the joke setup you mention in your question, and it's also from the same chapter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Martell sun, but ten years too young, Tyrion thought as he reined up, too fit as well, and far too fierce. He knew what he must deal with by then. <strong>How many Dornishmen does it take to start a war? he asked himself. Only one.</strong> Yet he had no choice but to smile.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess this can count as a joke; <em>A Clash of Kings</em>, ""Tyrion IV"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""This secret is your lord father's sworn man.""<br>
  ""My father would be the first to tell you that <strong>fifty thousand Dornishmen are worth one rabid dog</strong>.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not exactly a joke, but a humorous stereotype from <em>A Feast for Crows</em>, ""Prologue"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Leo's eyes were hazel, bright with wine and malice. ""Your mother was a monkey from the Summer Isles. <strong>The Dornish will fuck anything with a hole between its legs.</strong> Meaning no offense. You may be brown as a nut, but at least you bathe. Unlike our spotted pig boy."" He waved a hand toward Pate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>A Game of Thrones</em>, ""Eddard IV"", mentions a similar humorous stereotypical remark:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The Crown is more than six million gold pieces in debt, Lord Stark. The Lannisters are the biggest part of it, but we have also borrowed from Lord Tyrell, the Iron Bank of Braavos, and several Tyroshi trading cartels. Of late I've had to turn to the Faith. <strong>The High Septon haggles worse than a Dornish fishmonger.</strong>""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There's also <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/The_Dornishman%27s_Wife"" rel=""noreferrer"">""The Dornishman's Wife""</a> from <em>A Storm of Swords</em>, ""Jon I"", which is a humorous song about how Dornish women are so fair they're worth getting killed for.</p>

<p>Like you say, there are many other Dornish stereotypes mentioned in the books, like ""men said it was the food that made Dornishmen so hot-tempered and their women so wild and wanton"", but those aren't jokes or meant to be humorous.</p>

<p>As a bonus, although you asked about the books: We do have another joke in the same genre in the first <em>Game of Thrones</em> episode of the fourth season, ""Two Swords"" (<a href=""https://youtu.be/wYSK1DAazhM?t=13s"" rel=""noreferrer"">video</a>), although we don't learn the punchline here either:</p>

"17823","How did Jaqen H'ghar get caught?","<p>Following a recent 9gag post:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/EIJaI.jpg"" alt=""post""></p>

<p>Did Jaqen H'ghar end up in that cage because he knew that he would meet and ""recruit"" Arya, or was it some strange coincidence? Is it described somewhere in the books, or left unexplained?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","17831","<p>It is not explained in the books, but there is mention of him in AFFC, I believe, when a prison guard mentions that there were three men in the black cells. Ned Stark gave Yoren the pick of the dungeons, which included those three, and presumably Jaqen.</p>

<p>The fan speculation that Jaqen is Syrio Forel is based mostly on wishful thinking, as there is no evidence of that, other than the fact that Syrio might have been captured and Jaqen appears in the black cells at around the same time. And also because he knew Arya's real identity. But like I said above, I believe Jaqen was already in the dungeons when Ned was Hand.</p>

<p>On that note, on the forums of Westeros.org, it has become somewhat of a meme that everyone is Syrio Forel or Jaqen H'ghar. So there are many theories, most of them probably not true. </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>One theory connected Jaqen with the death of Balon Greyjoy, combined with the prophecy from the Ghost of High Heart:<p>
<em>I dreamt of a man without a face, waiting on a bridge that swayed and swung. On his shoulder perched a drowned crow with seaweed hanging from his wings.</em><p>
This is likely a faceless man, sent by Euron Greyjoy to push Balon off the bridge described in an early Theon chapter. But I find it unlikely that it would be Jaqen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I also highly doubt that Jaqen got himself thrown in the black cells on purpose. It is hard to assassinate people while locked up and in chains. A reasonable theory is that he was caught during a mission.</p>

<p>The observant readers will notice that Jaqen's story continues in the books. </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>In the prologue of AFFC, an alchemist is seen to murder the POV character, and his physical description matches that of Jaqen after he changed his appearance in front of Arya at Harrenhal. Apparently, Jaqen wanted access to the Citadel, for some as of yet undisclosed reason.</p>

<p>Craster must have somehow known that by putting out his baby boys, he would be protected by the White Walkers.</p>

<p>And the White Walkers must have learned Craster's Keep was a source of fresh recruits.</p>

<p><div class=""youtube-embed""><div>

            </div></div></p>

<p>But how did that arrangement start? Is there anything in the books that mentions how?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","156186","<p>I'm sorry to say we don't know for sure, there is nothing definitive in the books so far, so much of what follows is speculation on my part based on what little lore we do get in the novels.</p>

<p>In the books, the original Night's King was supposedly the 13th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch who fell in love with what was probably a female Other (White Walker in the show). She is described as having ""skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars"" and her skin was cold as ice, and we're told he ""gave her his seed"".</p>

<p>It's suggested the Night's King and his Queen made sacrifices to the Others, which sounds very reminiscent of Craster. We're never told who was sacrificed or how, maybe it was NK's own children, this might even explain the Night's Watch vow to sire no children. His castle was the Nightfort, which has a creepy magical Weirwood door called the Black Gate beneath it. This gate leads to North of the Wall, very useful for carrying babies beyond the Wall's protections, and when you pass through it the door's mouth grows until it swallows, almost like you're being consumed by the Old Gods. </p>

<p>It's possible this practice of sacrificing to the Others was passed down through the generations. There is some suggestion that the knowledge of sacrificing to the Others exists on the periphery of Northern society. The Wildlings seem to think Others steal their children and a common insult in the North is ""The Other's take you"". If this was a common practice which is dying out now that Mance has unified the Wildlings and made them stronger, that might explain why the Others have returned. If they need the children of men to convert in order to exist, and they're now only getting a handful from Craster, perhaps they're taking a more direct approach. </p>

<p>Alternatively, it's possible that the practice was only recently rediscovered, which might also explain the Others' return. There is some suggestion that Craster is a descendant of the original pairing of Night's King and Queen. People say of him that he has black blood and has a cold smell to him and that he appears less than human. If Craster has the blood of the Others then this might also explain his incest, as a means of purifying that blood for them, of not diluting it (a parallel to the Targaryen practice of incest, also intended for the same purpose).</p>

<p>His name might also have originally come from a mangled form of ""Stark"", like the Karstarks, and since there's a non-zero possibility that the original Night's King was also a Stark, perhaps the name passed down and eventually became Craster. If Craster is really a descendant of this pairing then him knowing of the sacrifices or working it out by some piece of familial knowledge passed down through the generations may explain how he came to be sacrificing his children.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Gilly's baby is nicknamed ""Monster"" in the novels, which might be foreshadowing if the baby has the blood of the Others. Especially since the baby is at the Wall and everyone believes it to be the child of Mance, King in the North. Melisandre is also at the Wall. I'm not sure the Others will be too happy if one of their blood kin was sacrificed as an offering to R'hllor.</p>

<p>A <strong>Great House</strong> is one that is answerable <em>only</em> to the Crown. There are no noble houses senior to it. In essence, they are mini kingdoms. In Westeros, at the beginning of the series, the Great Houses are: </p>

<ul>
<li>House Stark of the North </li>
<li>House Baratheon of the Stormlands</li>
<li>House Lannister of the Westerlands </li>
<li>House Tully of the Riverlands </li>
<li>House Arryn of the Vale </li>
<li>House Greyjoy of the Iron Islands </li>
<li>House Tyrell of the Reach</li>
<li>House Martell of Dorne</li>
</ul>

<p>Under a Great House you have several <strong>Noble Houses</strong> serving them. They pay taxes, supply military aid in times of need, and submit to the authority of it's Great House. A Noble House is simply a noble family that has, more or less, full control of its territory and commands the allegiance of its inhabitants. Depending on it's size, a Noble House might have several lesser lords serving the more senior lord. For instance, House Royce (a vassal of House Arryn of the Vale) has two branches: House Royce of the Runestone, which is the senior branch, and House Royce of the Gates, which is a less senior cadet offshoot of the main branch. Sometimes, enough time passes that the cadet branch becomes it's own house. For instance House Karstark started out as a cadet branch of House Stark, known as the Starks of Karhold. With time Karhold Starks became Karstarks.</p>

<p>Under a Noble House you can have several <strong>Knightly Houses</strong>. Those are Knights who have also been granted land (along with its accompanying peasants) as reward for good service. In essence they are proto-Noble Houses, not big enough to have vassals of its own and do not have the authority to serve justice or arbitrate and must submit to its lord in those cases. For instance, House Clegane is a knightly house that swears fealty to House Lannister. </p>

<h1>Human</h1>
<h3>Westerosi</h3>
<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Common_Tongue"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>Common Tongue</strong></a>: This language developed/took hold<sup>1</sup> after the Andal invasion of Westeros. Andal bands coming from Andalos in Essos repeatedly attacked Westerosi realms of the first men, carving out their own Kingdoms. Eventually the only place where the First Men retained their religion, customs and sovreignity was the Kingdom of the North. In the aftermath, The Common tongue developed which was adopted by North as well at a certain point. The accents can differ from North to Dorne, to the point that it is possible to discern the homeland of a person from his accent.</p>
<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Old_Tongue"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>Old Tongue:</strong></a> This was the original language of Westeros spoken by Giants and the First Men. Eventually with the Andal invasion, the old tongue started dying out in Westeros. Today it is spoken only beyond the wall by some Wildling clans such as Thenns or Giants.</p>
<h3>Essosi</h3>
<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/High_Valyrian"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>High Valyrian:</strong></a> This was the language of the Dragonlords of Valyrian Freehold. With the rapid expansion of Freehold and establishment of Colonies, different dialects such as Bravosi, Lysene, Lorathi, Myrish, Norvoshi, Pentoshi, Qohorik, Volantenese and Tyroshi developed overtime in the Colonies. By extension, one can say that Vulgar Ghiscari and its dialects can be considered to be dialects of High Valyrian. Furthermore, as Elyria, Tolos and Mantarys were founded by Valyrians as well, they can also be considered part of Valyrian family. The High Valyrian can be considered the Planetosi equivalent of Latin or Persian in our world. With the Doom of Valyria however, the language started going out of common usage and is today alive only in literary circles.</p>
<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Old_Ghiscari"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>Old Ghiscari:</strong></a> This was the language of ancient Ghiscari Empire which vied with the nascent Valyrian Empire for supremacy in the earliest days of mankind. Ghiscari Empire was overwhelmed by the Valyrians and as the state ceased to exist, the language started going out of use as well due to prevalence of Valyrian language.</p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/High_Valyrian#Slaver_Cities"" rel=""noreferrer"">Vulgar Ghiscari:</a></strong> This bastard tongue originated in occupied lands of former Ghiscari Empire which can be compared to <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/28999/why-are-the-german-and-french-languages-so-different/29000#29000"">rise of modern day French from Vulgar Latin</a> which was a blend of Latin with old Celtic Gaulic language. It is a blend of Valyrian and old Ghiscari. It has given birth to a number of its own dialects such as Astapori, Yunkish and Meereenese.</p>
<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dothraki_language"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>Dothraki:</strong></a> Dothraki is, well the language of the Nomadic Dothraki people from Essos. This is one of the few languages of Essos which have remained unaffected by rise of Valyrian primarily because of the lack of contact between the Valyrians and the Dothraki.</p>

<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rhoynar"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>Rhoynar</strong></a> Although there is no mention of the Rhoynar tongue, it is only to be expected that given their different culture, ethnicity and history, the original Rhoynar must have developed their own language.</p>
<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ibbenese_language"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>Ibbenese:</strong></a> This is the language of the People of the City of Ibben.

"156420","How did Westeros measure time before Aegon's Conquest?","<p>We know that the Citadel measures time as ""years after Aegon's Conquest"". Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude they used a different system pre-Targaryen conquest, and only switched over to the system because it was a very historic occurrence. What system did the Maesters of the Citadel use before Aegon Targaryen made his realm?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","156422","<p><strong>We don't know...</strong> because the Maesters have not told us. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are none who can say with certain knowledge when the world began, yet this has not stopped many maesters and learned men from seeking the answer. Is it forty thousand years old, as some hold, or perhaps a number as large as five hundred thousand—or even more? It is not written in any book that we know, for in the first age of the world, the Dawn Age, men were not lettered. <br> <sub><strong><em>- The World of Ice and Fire, The Dawn Age</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The are thousands of years of history prior to Aegon's Conquest, but the maester never really tells why they chose the conquest, just that they <em>did</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The maesters of the Citadel who keep the histories of Westeros have used Aegon's Conquest as their touchstone for the past three hundred years. Births, deaths, battles, and other events are dated either AC (After the Conquest) or BC (Before the Conquest). <br> <sub><strong><em>- The World of Ice and Fire, The Conquest</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition the information <em>may</em> be out there, we as readers, have not been given ""access""</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One issue that plagues all studies of the ancient records is how differently the varied cultures reckon days and seasons and years. Archmaester Walgram's great work, The Reckoning of Time, delves deeply into this problem, but there is little consensus on what the dates we have actually mean in our own reckoning. <br> <sub><strong><em>- The World of Ice and Fire, Other Lands</em></strong></sub></p>

<p>If we could get our hands on a copy of <em>The Reckoning of Time</em> we might have a much better answer...</p>

<p>I'm planning to play in an ASOIAF rpg, and me and a friend of mine are going to be a noble house in service to the Tyrells in The Reach. We are twins of the house, and will one day succeed our father. I realize Head of the house goes to the eldest, even by a few seconds, but would it be unheard of if we choose to rule as joint lords? Would it be accepted?</p>

<p>But often the Lord gives some of his responsibilities to other people.
The most common example found in the books would be the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Castellan"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Castellan</a>. His responsibility is the defense of a castle, fort or city.</p>

The game introduced the title of Lord Sentinel which is granted by the Lord.
The Lord Sentinel has total power over the House and is only second the actual Lord. So the position of the Lord Sentinel is quite similar to the position of the Hand of the King.</p>

"18518","Why didn't Sansa leave with the Hound?","<p>In the HBO TV series Game of Thrones episode Blackwater, the Hound offered to take Sansa to Winterfell. The ending of the scene was ambiguous and I thought she left King's Landing with the Hound. However, in the next episode she's still in King's Landing. Perhaps in the books there is a better description of events, but I do not think they explained Sansa's thought process very well in the TV series.</p>

<p>In the episode Sansa is under the impression that the city had fallen to Stannis Baratheon's forces. King Joffrey made her suffer in previous episodes, and during the Battle of Blackwater, no one was watching Sansa and she had an opportunity to escape. Why did Sansa stay in King's Landing after all she endured? </p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><game-of-thrones>","18762","<p>I have read the books and seen the series. Here's my take:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the book, Clegane is <em>in her bed drunk, crying, and covered in blood</em>. Not a great scene for a teen to walk into. And he didn't expect her to be there.  She's supposed to be hiding in Maegor's Holdfast. He went there to experience what <em>he</em> thinks is his last time to ""be"" with her.</p>

<p>He also grabs her quite violently, throws her on the bed, and holds a knife to her throat and MAKES her sing a song to him. If you read the tale behind the song, it's relevant. The Florian and the Jonquil. He does <em>not</em> kiss her. at all. Sansa recollects later that he kissed her - she is an unreliable narrator, and still has a <em>lot</em> of evolving to do.</p>

<p>That scene alone would have scared <em>anyone</em> out of going with him.  </p></li>
<li><p>Outside the window, <em>wildfire is raging</em>. Sansa sees that. It's terrifying.  </p></li>
<li><p>She thinks Stannis has won - she has always thought if he won, <em>barring Ser Ilyn beheading her</em>, that she will be safe. But hey, Stannis is one mean son of a gun and determined.</p></li>
<li><p>In the end, Sansa decides better the devil I know than the one I don't, which is escaping and hitting the road to who knows where<sup>*</sup>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And to clarify something if you have read book three, and I won't give spoilers here: what The Hound says about Sansa, although brutish, is done to incite another to kill him. He would <em>never</em> have done what he says he wished he had done. And besides, it was to keep her out of the hands of the Lannisters anyway, whom he despises.</p>

"87012","Is there any proof that Jaime Lannister is actually a good swordsman?","<p>From what I can tell of Jaime Lannister, he is a good swordsman, because he has fought numerous battles and lived to tell the tale.</p>

<p>What I can't find is any evidence of him beating anyone in a duel with anyone actually good with a sword. All the one-on-one fights he has taken part in with anyone who is particularly skilled with a sword have been inconclusive.</p>

<p>These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Big Belly Ben of the Kingswood Brotherhood: He saves Lord Sumner Crakehall, but Ben escapes.</li>
<li>The Smiling Knight of the Kingswood Brotherhood: He managed to hold him back until Ser Arthur Dayne managed to take over and kill him.</li>
<li>Ned Stark: One of Jaime's guards manages to intervene by attacking Ned before the fight is over.</li>
<li>Brienne of Tarth: Their fight is interrupted my Vargo Hoat (Locke in the TV series).</li>
</ul>

<p>There might be more, but I can't find anything about them on the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jaime_Lannister"" rel=""noreferrer"">wiki</a>.</p>

<p>He might have won a tourney melée or two in his youth, but from what I can tell most of the better knights joust, so I doubt he would have bested anyone noteworthy in a sword fight during a tourney.</p>

<p>And he was only given the position of Kingsguard by Aerys because he wanted to make sure that Tywin's heir couldn't inherit his lands.</p>

<p>Every other scenario I can think of that he has fought in throughout the timeline of the books/tv show have been in a group, like the Battle of the Whispering Wood and when he attempted to escape from Riverrun (books).</p>

<p>Of course, now that he has lost his right hand it is likely that he will never be good again, but with his left hand he can't even compete with Ser Ilyn Payne/Bronn.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that Jaime was <em>good</em>, as he is an heir of one of the greater houses, so would have had the best training, but where did he gain this fearsome reputation of being one of the best? Was it simply because he became a Kingsguard so young?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Thanks to the comment of <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/25675/nika-g"">Nika G</a> for pointing out the feats of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Barristan_Selmy#Entry_in_the_White_Book"" rel=""noreferrer"">Barristan the Bold</a>, this is the exact kind of thing I'm looking for.</p>

<p>There's not much in the White Book about Jaime, and that's kind of what I mean. Whilst he has shown his bravery (protecting Brienne from being killed) and ferocity (trying to kill Robb after he had already lost the Battle of the Whispering Wood), we haven't had much proof of his supposed legendary <em>skill</em>.</p>

<p>I don't doubt that Jaime is actually a <em>good</em> swordsman, he has cut down knights left, right and center. But they were all less experienced/not as well trained, that's nothing more than many others have done. People like Ned Stark, Jon Snow &amp; Stannis Baratheon are all considered <em>good</em> swordsmen, but none of them are called the best.</p>

<p>I'm saying that Jaime hasn't done much to claim the mantle of the <em>best</em> (or one of) other than being appointed the youngest Kingsguard in history, which he didn't get on battle merits alone. I'm asking if his reputation might have originated from somewhere other than that, or if people had given him this accolade simply from seeing him fight (like Barristan Selmy).</p>

  <p>The visitors poured through the gates in a river of gold and silver and polished steel, three hundred strong, a pride of bannermen and knights, of sworn swords and freeriders.  Over their heads a dozen golden banners whipped back and forth in the northern wind, emblazoned with <strong>the crowned stag of Baratheon.</strong><br>

</blockquote>

<p>I don't recall any mention of Robert changing his sigil when he became king.  Was the stag always crowned, and it just happened to become appropriate when Robert gained the throne? Is it common for new kings to add a crown to their sigil?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","157033","<p>The Stag was always crowned as the sigil was taken from that of House Durrandon.<br>
During Aegon's Conquer, Orys Baratheon, one of Aegon I's generals was tasked with taking over Storm's End from House Durrandon. After marrying Lord Argilac's daughter, he took the House words and sigil to be his own, as the blood of the Durrandon line would continue through him.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>House Baratheon was born amidst the rain and mud of the battle known to history as the Last Storm, when Orys Baratheon thrice turned back the charge of the knights of Storm’s End and slew their king Argilac the Arrogant in single combat. Storm’s End, long thought to be impregnable, yielded to Orys without a battle (wisely, given the fate of Harrenhal). Afterward Orys took King Argilac’s daughter to wife and adopted the Durrandon arms and words as his own to honor Argilac’s valor.<br>

<p>It seems Orys did so out of respect to the fallen King.</p>

It was Durran Godsgrief the founder of House Durrandon who made the sigil and ""crowned the stag"".</p>

<hr>

<p>To answer the other part of your question:  </p>

<p>No, new kings do not add crowns to their sigil. Multiple examples exist of Houses rising to royalty and not changing their sigil, most notably being House Lannister, House Gardener, House Stark and House Hoare.</p>

<p>One example of a king adding a crown to his sigil is Euron Crow's Eye, who after killing his brother Balon, becomes the King of the Iron Islands and the North.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The charge was one Sam had never seen before: a red eye with a black pupil, beneath a black iron crown supported by two crows. “Whose banner is that?” Sam asked. Xhondo only shrugged.”<br>
  <sub>A Feat for Crows - Chapter 45, Samwell V</sub></p>

<p>However, we must note that this was merely Euron's personal sigil, and not that of House Greyjoy.</p>

But why didn’t Robert accompany them? He was betrothed to Lyanna and if he really loved Lyanna, then why didn't he go to King's Landing to justify things? He only rebelled when his life was at stake as Aerys asked for his head from Jon Arryn.</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","226618","<p>Because things didn't play out as smoothly as that. Brandon found out about Lyanna's kidnapping on his way to Riverrun for his wedding to Catelyn. So instead of continuing to Riverrun he, and some companions rode to King's Landing demanding to see Rhaegar. Aerys had them arrested and then summoned their fathers to court for the trial but instead of the trial had them all killed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;He was on his way to Riverrun when...&quot; Strange, how telling it still made her throat grow tight, after all these years. &quot;...when he heard about Lyanna, and went to King's Landing instead. It was a rash thing to do.&quot; She remembered how her own father had raged when the news had been brought to Riverrun. The gallant fool, was what he called Brandon.</p>
<p>Jaime poured the last half cup of wine. &quot;He rode into the Red Keep with a few companions, shouting for Prince Rhaegar to come out and die. But Rhaegar wasn't there. Aerys sent his guards to arrest them all for plotting his son's murder. The others were lords' sons too, it seems to me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ethan Glover was Brandon's squire,&quot; Catelyn said. &quot;He was the only one to survive. The others were Jeffory Mallister, Kyle Royce, and Elbert Arryn, Jon Arryn's nephew and heir.&quot; It was queer how she still remembered the names, after so many years. &quot;Aerys accused them of treason and summoned their fathers to court to answer the charge, with the sons as hostages. When they came, he had them murdered without trial. Fathers and sons both.&quot;</p>

<p>The thing is here Robert was at the Eyrie with Jon Arryn as his ward at that point. Jon is an incredibly smart and collected man and would have advised against Robert and Eddard marching down south. Brandon, was similar to Robert, a hothead, and marched straight down there the second he heard with no one to really council him against it. And that is assuming they had even heard of Lyanna's kidnapping <em>before</em> his brother was arrested and his father sent for. Remember message times are not instant in Westeros.</p>
<p>It's all just a matter of timing and location really.</p>

"87706","What's the big deal with the Tyrells controlling Westeros?","<p>So it's been a few years since I last read the books, but watching the television show has made me think about the overall story once again. Generic spoilers to follow.</p>

<p>A big theme in the book is that things are getting ""worse"" for the people of Westeros (this is echoed in the sentiments of one of the series' few savvy master manipulators: Varys). This isn't a big surprise, as it's common to give a ""build-up"" to the climax. In Game of Thrones (TV-Show), this means that:</p>

<ul>
<li>The kingdom is splintering,</li>
<li>Debt to the Iron Bank of Braavos is mounting, and </li>
<li>Various cells within and without the kingdom are generally becoming less content with the ruling party.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, at the beginning, things weren't all that bad; there was relative peace in the kingdom - even though the leadership (King Robert) was a bit apathetic. After his death, things are tense, but under control... and then Ned's death sets off a massive civil war. The North just wants to be free, Renly just wants to be a king cause it's cool, and Stannis wants to be king because *that's how inheritance <em>actually</em> works, Renly.*</p>

<p>After <strong>a lot</strong> of bad stuff happens, things eventually calm down. The North's rebellion is effectively suppressed, Renly is dead, Stannis has lost the vast majority of his military power, Joffrey has choked on his reign of terror, the Lannister's strongest personalities are dead (Tywin) or gone (Tyrion), Myrcella's presence is soothing Dorne, and the Throne has been stabilized by the wealth and power of the Tyrell house.</p>

<p>So why is Varys officially giving up on the Seven Kingdoms? Kevan Lannister, a man who could <em>only</em> help stabilize the kingdom is intentionally killed. Varys claims to serve the people of Westeros, yet he's turning his back on it as soon as things have a chance to be the best they've ever been. To illustrate:</p>

<ul>
<li>Margaery is strongly implied to be the power behind the Throne, and has demonstrated herself to act with the social cunning and political skills of anyone in King's Landing, without the trappings of insanity that most of them have. She's shown herself to be far more generous and well-liked than her predecessor, Cersei, in only a few years. </li>
<li>House Tyrell has just overshadowed the Lannisters - the previous ruling party - which would pacify the North as well as Dorne. </li>
<li>Let's not forget too, that the last Targaryen whom Varys saw was the one who is universally recognized as a monster and tyrant. </li>
</ul>

<p>Things are great now, yet Varys - the man I identify as the voice of many of the readers' sentiments - has officially abandoned it.  </p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","87710","<p>From what we know, Varys might simply be a <em>loyalist</em>.<br>
He might be totally loyal to the House Targaryen and when he says he has the best interest of the Seven Kingdoms at heart, he might not be lying. He might simply think that the Targaryens are the only truly worthy rulers.  </p>

<p>You should not forget that while Aerys was a madman there were many other Targaryens who were good leaders. The dynasty remained in power for over three centuries. And while dragons surely played a role in securing their rule, the Seven Kingdoms would not have put up with them if all of them would have been crazy or bloodthirsty.<br>
The Targaryens made the Seven Kingdoms and Aerys son Rhaegar was well loved. People were probably looking forward to him taking the throne. 
So Aerys is not the <em>last</em> Targaryen Varys has seen. He knows that they can do much better than the last king.  </p>

<p>Daenerys is showing particular promise. While she's still young and learning she is also pretty moderate and seems to be a rather fair ruler. The fact that she brought dragons back into the world is probably also seen as a sign by many that she is destined to be a great leader.<br>
Daenerys is told several times that if she were to return to Westeros, a number of people would rally to her banner. So Targaryen loyalist apparently still exist in Westeros and Varys might be one of them. Already working towards the return of a Targaryen to the throne from behind the curtains.  </p>

<p>Of course it could also be ambition. He apparently did all he could to protect Aerys and warned him especially about Tywin Lannister - who then turned on his king exactly as Vayrs had said he would. And then he did all he could to keep the last survivors of House Targaryen alive and give them a chance to reclaim their birthright.  </p>

<p>This would also guarantee him a place in the history books as the kingmaker who returned the rightful rulers to the Iron Throne and brought peace to the kingdoms. He might also become the secret power behind the throne. But who knows what secret ambitions he really has.<br>
Of course he would not want to see all he's worked for be for nothing, even if an acceptable alternative for peace in the kingdoms has already presented itself.</p>

<p>I suspect it's actually a mixture of both, his loyalty and ambition that keeps him following the path he's chosen for himself. For better or worse.</p>

"87746","What is the surname of Brienne?","<p>I realize that this seems like a ridiculous question, because Brienne's father is Lord Selwyn Tarth, and as his daughter she will be known as Brienne Tarth.</p>

<p>But in every single reference I have found to her she is known as Brienne <strong>of</strong> Tarth. Even searching on the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Brienne_of_Tarth"">wiki</a> for Brienne Tarth redirected me to Brienne of Tarth.</p>

<p>This makes no sense. I know that the island that she was born on is called Tarth, which I'm assuming is where her family name comes from, so this title makes sense (like <em>Sansa of Winterfell</em> for example). But why is the <strong>of</strong> <em>always</em> included?</p>

<p>She is the heir to Evenfall Hall, so she does by all accounts hold the name (she isn't a bastard), so why is she never referred to as Brienne Tarth? Is this even her name?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","87753","<p>Brienne is a character of unique circumstances within the world of ASoIaF. She is the daughter of a noble house, true, but is also trying to distance herself from that nobility. In addition, she is AFAIK the only example of a female knight in Westeros. These two factors together make her identity and naming somewhat unusual.</p>

<p>On the one hand, you are correct - her surname, as member of a minor house, is ""Brienne Tarth"". However, she seems to prefer being known as simply a knight from the island of Tarth. Under those circumstances, the name ""Brienne of Tarth"" would be more appropriate.</p>

<p>Brienne's father, Lord Selwyn Tarth, has also been known to use ""Lord Selwyn of Tarth"", so Brienne may also have chosen her name with that in mind. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Since Brienne has not been formally knighted, she is unable to use the formal title of <strong><em>Ser</em></strong>, assuming that <strong><em>Ser</em></strong> would even apply to a woman. Despite this, she identifies herself as a knight and lives her life accordingly.</p>

"87928","Horn of Winter = Dragonbinder?","<p>Is there any definitive evidence that the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Horn_of_Winter"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Horn of Winter</a> sought by Mance Rayder is not actually a <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragon_horn"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dragon horn</a> or indeed <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragonbinder"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dragonbinder</a> itself?</p>

<p>At first we are led to believe that Mance found the Horn of Winter north of the wall and brought it south with his army to break the Wall.  The horn is captured when Stannis Baratheon's troops routed the army, and was made fuel for Mance's pyre.  Then we discover that..</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Mance was bluffing - the horn was a fake (<strong>and</strong> not killed in that event!)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At around the same time or soon after, Euron Greyjoy turns up at the Kingsmoot with the dragon horn called Dragonbinder, claiming it came from Valyria.  He gives it to his brother Victarion when sending him to 'fetch' Daenerys Targaryen (I can imagine how poorly <em>that</em> will go!).</p>

<p>This horn supposedly binds or controls dragons, but almost anyone that blows it suffers death from 'blackened lung' (though presumably Daenerys herself could blow it safely, given she has dragon's blood in her veins).</p>

<hr>

<p>Although the Horn of Winter was supposedly somewhere north of the Wall, and Dragonbinder was sourced from Valyria, some of the answers to <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/11784/what-was-euron-crows-eye-greyjoy-doing-in-valyria/"">What was Euron &quot;Crow&#39;s Eye&quot; Greyjoy doing in Valyria?</a> display skepticism that Euron was ever in Valyria (so he might have <em>actually</em> obtained it north of the wall).</p>

<p>There are also some tentative links between dragons and 'things north' in that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dragons can make dragon glass which is capable of killing White Walkers</li>
<li>If dragons can make short work of Harrenhal, they can also make .. a breach in a wall made of ice!  It is noted in the <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/64384/3797"">this answer on Dragons</a> that..</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dragons are believed to be intrinsically tied to magic and the seasons of the world. Since dragons became extinct from Westeros, the power of magic dwindled and <strong>winters grew colder.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which in turn suggests that if Dragons were brought to the Wall and destroyed it, the problem of the others would also abate, since the others are known to be associated with the cold/winter, if not only moving around in it, then perhaps even causing it.</p>

<p>Of course none of these tidbits are definitive evidence that the two horns are one and the same, so my question boils down to:  Is there some evidence I missed that definitively rules out that the two horns are actually a single horn with two names?</p>

"19910","Why is Cersei commonly referred to as ""Cersei Lannister"" instead of ""Cersei Baratheon""?","<p>I've watched the first two seasons of the TV series, and I'm in the middle of the first book. While reading, I noticed that Catelyn is usually referred to by her married name:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Scarlet-tinged spittle flew from the fat innkeep's mouth as she begged of <strong>Catelyn Stark</strong>, ""Don't kill him here!""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Her maiden name is only used in the past tense:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I <strong>was</strong> still <strong>Catelyn Tully</strong> the last time I bedded here,"" she told the innkeep.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same seems to be true for Lysa Arryn (can't find an example right now) and other married ladies. Yet, the book calls the queen by her maiden name:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Cersei Lannister</strong> entered behind him, a jeweled tiara in her hair.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there an in-world explanation for that? Are the ""naming rules"" different for the royal couple?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><game-of-thrones>","19928","<p>I don't know that we've ever had a formal description of the Westeros rules for styling and naming, but it seems to be based heavily on medieval European customs. In that case, it would make sense for Cersei to retain her name, as she married into royalty.</p>

<p>Of course, the real-world naming and marriage customs are complex, vary from culture to culture, and change frequently. Things get even more convoluted when you add in the inheritance of the crown. But in general, most medieval European cultures followed rules that were similar to the following:</p>

<p>When a woman marries into a titled family (the only people that had proper ""last names""), she takes on her husbands name. This is because she is leaving her old family (where she was of her father's house) and joining a new one (her husbands house.) Formally, they would be styled ""Lady Catelyn, of House Stark"", just like Ned is ""Lord Eddard of House Stark"", but in everyday usage they would be Ned and Catelyn Stark.</p>

<p>(In practice, the rules here vary a lot based on the situation. The Westeros example given in a previous comment had Genna, a Lannister, marrying a Frey. Depending on the current relative social/political standing of those two houses, she may choose to maintain her father's house name in common speech, though she would still be Genna, <em>nee</em> Lannister, of House Frey.)</p>

<p>When the man is royalty, however, the rules are different. A woman cannot <em>become</em> royalty by marrying into it, in the sense that they do not gain all of the privileges that a royal name has. Specifically, a woman who marries a king/prince cannot become Queen in her own right -- her <em>daughters</em> can, but she cannot. As such, while she becomes a member of the royal house, she doesn't ""take on"" her husbands name.</p>

<p>If you look back through English history, we can see plenty of examples of this convention. In particular, ASoIaF is based roughly on the historical War of the Roses,  which saw the Henry Tudor become the first Tudor king. Henry VII's son, the famous Henry VIII, would also have been named Henry Tudor, but his wives are still referred to as Catherine of Aragon, or Anne Boleyn. In modern England, woman who marry into royalty don't actually use a surname; e.g. Catherine Middleton now simply Catherine, <em>nee</em> Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge, since her husband is, among other things, the Duke of Cambridge. But, in informal conversation, and even in some media outlets, she is still often (incorrectly - see below) called ""Kate Middleton"", likely as a throwback to the historical naming convention.</p>

<p>In this sense, we can imagine that Cersei's full legal name while Robert was alive might be something like Her Majesty, Cersei <em>nee</em> Lannister, of House Baratheon, Queen of the Seven Kingdoms -- shortened to Queen Cersei Lannister.</p>

<p>I don't remember much about the other queens we've seen, or heard about, on-screen thus far but I think they fit this pattern. Stannis' wife, by this custom, would not take the Baratheon name as it was the current royal family when she married, and I only remember ever hearing her named as ""Lady Selyse"" or ""Selyse Florent"". Robb's wife is mostly just called ""Jeyne"" by Robb and Cat, but I don't remember anyone ever referring to her as Jeyne Stark. Margaery married <em>two</em> Baratheon kings and was still ""Margaery Tyrell"", and I don't know of any case where Rhaegar's wife was named as ""Elia Targaryan"".</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Unrelated side note, just to show how complex this stuff gets:</p>

<p>Referring to the Duchess of Cambridge as ""Catherine Middleton"" is not just impolite, it's flat out wrong. She should be addressed as ""Princess Catherine"" in all cases, but her ""legal"" surname is a matter of some confusion.  Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles would give their surname as Windsor, if required. Queen Elizabeth has specified that her <em>non-royal</em> descendants will take the surname Mountbatten-Windsor, which shouldn't apply to Princess Catherine. However, when she needed to file suit in a foreign court, she gave her name as Mountbatten-Windsor, as did her husband. So, clearly, what to call the wife of a royal family member is absolutely not a straightforward question.</p>

  <p>""At the start of his journey to Volantis Tyrion Lannister takes the opportunity to have a closer look at the Valyrian road that he and Illyrio are traveling on.

<p>The roads are made from fused stone that is built in a way that allows rain and snow to quickly run off the sides.</p>

<p>We can reason that this is a huge factor in its preservation and its condition.</p>

<p>Did they steal them?</p>

<p>Are these hand-me-downs from an ancient age?</p>

<p>Family heirlooms?</p>

<p>Seeing how the TV series doesn't answer this question yet, I will take quotes from the books or comments from George R R Martin.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","158820","<p>I won't discuss the fancy armor shown in the TV series <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vq9dO.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">because reasons</a>. </p>

<p>But since you have added the books tag and you are okay with it, here goes.</p>

<p>It is simply unknown as of now. </p>

<p>Others, as an intelligent distinct species, are completely shrouded in mystery. Little to nothing is known about them, <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/128987/54887"">their origins</a>, their customs or their way of life. They are <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/135532/54887"">not like their minions</a>, who use the same armor they were wearing at time of their death. The armor they don is no ordinary armor. Every inch of it screams out ""MAGIC"". </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Had many talks with George. He told me of the ice swords, and <strong>the
  reflective, camouflaging armor that picks up the images of the things
  around it like a clear, still pond</strong>. He spoke a lot about what they
  were not, but what they were was harder to put into words.""<br> <sub>-<strong>Tommy Patterson</strong> <em>(Comic book artist for the series)</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A shadow emerged from the dark of the wood. It stood in front of
  Royce. Tall, it was, and gaunt and hard as old bones, with flesh pale
  as milk. <strong>Its armor seemed to change color as it moved; here it was
  white as new-fallen snow, there black as shadow, everywhere dappled
  with the deep grey-green of the trees.</strong> The patterns ran like
  moonlight on water with every step it took.<br><sub>AGOT -
  Prologue</sub> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So that proves that their armor is not of human craftsmanship.</p>

<p>Let's take all of the possibilities that you have listed and discuss them one by one. </p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Do they make their own in an industrial fashion?</strong> </p>

<p>Plausible but extremely unlikely. Others are not known to do that kind of manual labor nor does the Wild North offer such resources to be used as Raw material. Because if that was the case, Wildling realm would have developed craftsmanship on par with the realm South of the wall. But then again, they could be using magic, as you suggested but the key thing to remember about magic in WOIAF is that it's not Harry Potter magic where you just whip out your wand and do it. Every bit of magic requires certain raw objects to work (Such as Dany's sacrifices to give birth to her dragons, Kingsblood concept etc). What exactly would the Others have to make their brand of magic work?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Did they steal them?</strong></p>

<p>Steal them from whom? The Night's Watch? The Watch <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/134922/54887"">doesn't wear the armor</a> like the others do. Nor do any other humans. There's no one else to steal from. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Are they hand-me-downs from another age?</strong></p>

<p>We do not know. They could have some sort of arsenal intact somewhere in the North, long forgotten since the Battle for Dawn, as were the people who probably built it. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Family Heirlooms?</strong></p>

<p>What family? We do not know if the Others even have a concept of family or heirlooms or if <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/133486/how-does-a-baby-who-is-turned-into-white-walker-grow-into-an-adult-white-walker/133490#133490"">they could even procreate</a> to build a family. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>GRRM is silent on the matter as far as I know. He will probably use his standard response <em>""Keep Reading!""</em> if asked, I am afraid.</p>

<p>In my humble opinion, it may be that it is some sort of magic which requires certain sacrifices to build super weapons (Craster's children giving power to the weapons like Nisa Nisa did to Azor Ahai's sword?). In any case, the canon answer is:</p>

<p><strong>We do not know.</strong></p>

<p>Disappointing but that's what we have so far. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> As Skooba kindly pointed out, GRRM has hinted that the Others make their own swords. When asked about their swords:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ice. But not like regular old ice. The Others can do things with ice
  that we can't imagine and make substances of it.</p>

<p>With Robert Baratheon hating the Targaryens so much, why didn't he change the currency? He had a relatively peaceful reign so he could focus on smaller matters like this.</p>

<p>It seems likely that newly minted gold Dragons would also have Robert's face on them. </p>

<hr>

<p>As to the question of replacing the front piece, that's something that would require a) recalling all of the existing Dragons and re-minting them at vast cost and b) having ""Stags"" stand for both the gold <em>and</em> silver currency, confusing the general populace and potentially leading to ill-feeling and suggestions of counterfeiting/watering the currency. </p>

<p>You may wish to note that according to <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/The_Hedge_Knight"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Hedge Knight</a> (set circa 90 years prior to Robert taking the throne) they've been using this system of coinage (Dragons/Stags/Stars) for at least a hundred years.

<blockquote>

  heated to an incredible heat</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who said that? Dragon incubators do not exist in Planetos. </p>

<p>Hatching a dragon is not that simple. </p>

<h3>Blood magic</h3>

<p>All the accomplishments of the Dragon Lords were thanks to Blood magic. They possibly used blood magic to hatch dragons from Wyverns and certainly used blood magic to bind Dragons to themselves. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In <strong>Septon Barth's Dragons, Wyrms, and Wyverns, he speculated that
  the bloodmages of Valyria used wyvern stock to create dragons</strong>.
  Though the bloodmages were alleged to have experimented mightily with
  their unnatural arts, this claim is considered far-fetched by most
  maesters, among them Maester Vanyon's Against the Unnatural contains
  certain proofs of dragons having existed in Westeros even in the

  their candles. Do you think that might be useful,
  Slayer?""<br><sub><strong><em>AFFC - Samwell V</em></strong></sub></p>

<h3>How did Daenerys do it?</h3>

<p>The kind of Blood magic shown there is simple, you provide sacrifice of something and you get something in return. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You'll have gold, horses, whatever you like.""</p>
  
  <p>""It is not a matter of gold or horses. This is bloodmagic, lady.
  <strong>Only death may pay for life.</strong>""<br><sub><strong><em>AGOT - Daenerys VIII</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The eggs that Daenerys had were very old. They had turned into stones by the time they came into her possession. Fate of other dragon eggs would be similar since last living dragon died in reign of King Aegon III centuries ago. </p>

<p>Even Illyrio, who gave her the eggs, had no idea that they would hatch. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I know that he gave me my dragon eggs.""</p>
  
  <p>He snorted. ""<strong>If he'd known they were like to hatch, he'd would have
  sat on them himself.</strong>""</p>
  
  <p>That made her smile despite herself. ""Oh, I have no doubt of that,

  his manse in Pentos to wed my sun-and-stars, but I was neither deaf
  nor blind. And I am no child now.""<br><sub><strong><em>ACOK - Daenerys
  III</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Daenerys however figured out a way. She figured out the nature of Mirri Maz Duur's magic and cleverly improvised.</p>

<p>She provided sacrifice of:</p>

<ol>
<li>Khal Drogo</li>
<li>A horse.<sup>1</sup></li>
<li>Mirri Maz Duur herself</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You will not hear me scream,"" Mirri responded as the oil dripped from
  her hair and soaked her clothing.</p>
  
  <p>""I will,"" Dany said, ""but it is not your screams I want, only your
  life. <strong>I remember what you told me. Only death can pay for life.</strong>""
  Mirri Maz Duur opened her mouth, but made no reply. As she stepped
  away, Dany saw that the contempt was gone from the maegi's flat black
  eyes; in its place was something that might have been fear. Then there
  was nothing to be done but watch the sun and look for the first
  star.<br><sub><strong><em>AGOT - Daenerys X</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For coup de grâce, she climbed into the pyre herself. As a result, the stone eggs came back to life and dragons were hatched.</p>

<p>This was a one-time magical event. Only time it ever succeeded. GRRM <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20001210110800/http://www.eventhorizon.com:80/sfzine/chats/transcripts/031899.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">cleared it up</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>George_RR_Martin</em></strong>: Granny, thanks for asking that. It gives me a chance
  to clear up a common misconception. TARGARYENS ARE NOT IMMUNE TO FIRE!
  <strong>The birth of Dany's dragons was unique, magical, wonderous, a miracle.</strong> She is called The Unburnt because she walked into the
  flames and lived. But her brother sure as hell wasn't immune to that
  molten gold.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not to mention, Daenerys might actually be someone very special. As Maester Aemon believed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What fools we were, who thought ourselves so wise! The error crept in
  from the translation. <strong>Dragons are neither male nor female</strong>, Barth saw
  the truth of that, but now one and now the other, as changeable as
  flame. The language misled us all for a thousand years. <strong>Daenerys is</strong>
  <strong>the one, born amidst salt and smoke. The dragons prove it.</strong><br><sub><strong><em>AFFC - Samwell IV</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Historical attempts</h3>

<p>That does not mean there were no attempts to rehatch dragons from stone-eggs before. King Aegon III asked mages and other scholars from Essos to hatch dragons from his cache of eggs. It failed. Prince Aerion drank wildfire thinking that it would transform him into a dragon. It failed. King Aegon V tried to use wildfire to hatch dragons, it failed and House Targaryen was wiped out save one lonely branch of Jaehaerys II Targaryen. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The look Stannis gave her was dark. ""Nine mages crossed the sea to
  hatch Aegon the Third's cache of eggs. Baelor the Blessed prayed over
  his for half a year. Aegon the Fourth built dragons of wood and iron.
  Aerion Brightflame drank wildfire to transform himself. The mages
  failed, King Baelor's prayers went unanswered, the wooden dragons
  burned, and Prince Aerion died screaming.""<br><sub><strong><em>ASOS - Davos
  V</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And also:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There were dragons here two hundred years ago, Sam found himself
  thinking, as he watched the cage making a slow descent. They would
  just have flown to the top of the Wall. Queen Alysanne had visited
  Castle Black on her dragon, and Jaehaerys, her king, had come after
  her on his own. Could Silverwing have left an egg behind? Or had
  Stannis found one egg on Dragonstone? Even if he has an egg, how can
  he hope to quicken it? Baelor the Blessed had prayed over his eggs,
  and other Targaryens had sought to hatch theirs with sorcery. All they
  got for it was farce and tragedy.<br><sub><strong><em>AFFC - Samwell I</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And also:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What became of the dream of dragons was a grievous tragedy born in a
  moment of joy. In the fateful year 259 AC, the king summoned many of
  those closest to him to Summerhall, his favorite castle, there to
  celebrate the impending birth of his first great-grandchild, a boy
  later named Rhaegar, to his grandson Aerys and granddaughter Rhaella,
  the children of Prince Jaehaerys.</p>
  
  <p>It is unfortunate that the tragedy that transpired at Summerhall left
  very few witnesses alive, and those who survived would not speak of
  it. A tantalizing page of Gyldayn's history—surely one of the very
  last written before his own death—hints at much, but the ink that was
  spilled over it in some mishap blotted out too much.</p>
  
  <p><em>...the blood of the dragon gathered in one... ...seven eggs, to honor the seven gods, though the king's own septon had warned...
  ...pyromancers... ...wild fire... ...flames grew out of
  control...towering...burned so hot that... ...died, but for the valor
  of the Lord Comman...</em><br><sub><strong><em>TWOIAF - The Targaryen Kings: Aegon
  V</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>There is no indication whether other people in possession of Dragon eggs ever attempted to hatch them. They would have thought it futile given that eggs were dead stones. They were used as valuable commodity, not as livestock. So in conclusion:</p>

<ol>
<li>Blood magic is required to hatch dragons.</li>
<li>Existing eggs in current timeline are essentially stones.</li>
<li>Daenerys' feat was a one-time magical event, a miracle. </li>

<h3>Signs before the act</h3>
<p>Daenerys observed many curious things before she came to the conclusion that the eggs could be hatched.</p>
<p>Daenerys had her first dragon dream before she was even given the eggs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet that night she dreamt of one. Viserys was hitting her, hurting
her. She was naked, clumsy with fear. She ran from him, but her body
seemed thick and ungainly. He struck her again. She stumbled and fell.
&quot;You woke the dragon,&quot; he screamed as he kicked her. &quot;You woke the
dragon, you woke the dragon.&quot; Her thighs were slick with blood. She
closed her eyes and whimpered. As if in answer, there was a hideous
ripping sound and the crackling of some great fire. When she looked
again, Viserys was gone, great columns of flame rose all around, and
<strong>in the midst of them was the dragon</strong>. It turned its great head slowly. When its molten eyes found hers, she woke, shaking and covered
with a fine sheen of sweat. She had never been so afraid
…<br><sub><em><strong>AGOT - Daenerys II</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>First thing she saw was red flames when light touched her eggs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dany gave the silver over to the slaves for grooming and entered her
tent. It was cool and dim beneath the silk. As she let the door flap
close behind her, <strong>Dany saw a finger of dusty red light reach out to
touch her dragon's eggs across the tent. For an instant a thousand
droplets of scarlet flame swam before her eyes</strong>. She blinked, and
they were gone.<br><sub><em><strong>AGOT - Daenerys III</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then she observed that when she touched the eggs, they felt hot. But she told herself that it was just because of sunlight.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stone, she told herself. They are only stone, even Illyrio said so,
the dragons are all dead. She put her palm against the black egg,
fingers spread gently across the curve of the shell. The stone was
warm. Almost hot. &quot;The sun,&quot; Dany whispered. &quot;The sun warmed them as
they rode.&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>AGOT - Daenerys III</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet the Eggs kept feeling warm on her touch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Khaleesi, “ Jhiqui said, “what is wrong? Are you sick?”</p>
<p>“I was,” she answered, standing over the dragon’s eggs that Illyrio
had given her when she wed. <strong>She touched one, the largest of the
three</strong>, running her hand lightly over the shelf. Black-and- scarlet,
she thought, like the dragon in my dream. <strong>The stone felt strangely
warm beneath her fingers</strong>... or was she still dreaming? <strong>She pulled
her hand back nervously</strong>.<br><sub><em><strong>AGOT - Daenerys III</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The curious thing was, only she could feel the heat, no one else could.</p>
<p>She saw a dragon dream again where she was doused with dragonfire and emerged unscathed, stronger and fiercer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>she dreamt the dragon dream again</strong>. Viserys was not in it this time. <strong>There was only her and the dragon</strong>. Its scales were black as
night, wet and slick with blood. Her blood, Dany sensed. Its eyes were
pools of molten magma, and when it opened its mouth, <strong>the flame came
roaring out in a hot jet</strong>. She could hear it singing to her. <strong>She
opened her arms to the fire, embraced it, let it swallow her whole,
let it cleanse her and temper her and scour her clean</strong>. She could
feel her flesh sear and blacken and slough away, could feel her blood
boil and turn to steam, and yet <strong>there was no pain. She felt strong
and new and fierce.</strong><br><sub><em><strong>AGOT - Daenerys III</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then she felt her unborn son reaching out to dragon-egg:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She was lying there, holding the egg, when she felt the child move
within her... as if he were reaching out, brother to brother, blood to
blood. “You are the dragon,” Dany whispered to him, “the true dragon.
I know it. I know it.”<br><sub><em><strong>AGOT - Daenerys IV</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Robert's catspaw tried to kill her, she was very much shaken. She then tried to <em>hatch</em> the dragons, but failed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the coals were afire, Dany sent Ser Jorah from her.</p>
<p>She had to be alone to do what she must do. This is madness, she told
herself as she lifted the black-and-scarlet egg from the velvet. It
will only crack and burn, and it's so beautiful, Ser Jorah will call
me a fool if I ruin it, and yet, and yet …</p>
<p>Cradling the egg with both hands, she carried it to the fire and
pushed it down amongst the burning coals. The black scales seemed to
glow as they drank the heat. Flames licked against the stone with
small red tongues. Dany placed the other two eggs beside the black one
in the fire. As she stepped back from the brazier, the breath trembled
in her throat. She watched until the coals had turned to ashes. Drifting sparks floated up and out of the smokehole. Heat shimmered in waves around the dragon's eggs. And that was all.<br><sub><em><strong>AGOT - Daenerys VI</strong></em></sub></p>

<h3>How did it happen?</h3>
<p>She first came to know about how the blood magic worked when the Maegi gave away too much.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>she pleaded. “Save him, and I will free you, I swear it. <strong>You must know</strong>
<strong>a way... some magic, some...</strong>”</p>
<p>Mirri Maz Duur sat back on her heels and studied Daenerys through eyes
as black as night. “There is a spell.” Her voice was quiet, scarcely
more than a whisper. “But it is hard, lady, and dark. Some would say
that death is cleaner. I learned the way in Asshai, and paid dear for
the lesson. <strong>My teacher was a bloodmage from the Shadow Lands</strong>.”</p>
<p>Dany went cold all over. “Then you truly are a maegi.”</p>
<p>“Am I? Mirri Maz Duur smiled. “Only a maegi can save your rider now,
Silver Lady.”</p>
<p>“Is there no other way?”</p>
<p>“No other.”</p>
<p>Khal Drogo gave a shuddering gasp.</p>
<p>“Do it,” Dany blurted. She must not be afraid; she was the blood of
the dragon. “Save him.”</p>
<p>“There is a price,” the godswife warned her.</p>
<p>“You’ll have gold, horses, whatever you like.”</p>
<p>“It is not a matter of gold or horses. <strong>This is bloodmagic, lady. Only</strong>
<strong>death may pay for life</strong>.”<br><sub><em><strong>AGOT - Daenerys VIII</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was later confirmed by the Maegi later:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You warned me that only death could pay for life. I thought you meant
the horse.”</p>
<p>“No,” Mirri Maz Duur said. “That was a lie you told yourself. You knew
the price.”</p>
<p>Had she? Had she? If I look back I am lost. “The price was paid,” Dany
said.<br><sub><em><strong>AGOT - Daenerys IX</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Daenerys now had a fair idea of how exactly does the magic work. She was about to test it on Drogo's funeral pyre. The Maegi however tried to bluff that the sacrifice alone is not enough.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>It is not enough to kill a horse</strong>,” she told Dany. “By itself, the
blood is nothing. <strong>You do not have the words to make a spell</strong>, nor the
wisdom to find them. Do you think bloodmagic is a game for children?
You call me maegi as if it were a curse, but all it means is wise. You
are a child, with a child’s ignorance. <strong>Whatever you mean to do, it</strong>
<strong>will not work</strong>. Loose me from these bonds and I will help you.”<br><sub><em><strong>AGOT - Daenerys X</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Daenerys however learnt not to be bitten by the same snake twice. She didn't take the bait. People around her thought that she was either trying to resurrect Drogo or worst, trying to commit suicide out of grief.</p>
<p>But Daenerys clearly pointed out that she was not committing suicide. This implies she knew what she was doing and she knew what would be the result.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I understand that you loved him,” Ser Jorah said in a voice thick
with despair. “I loved my lady wife once, yet I did not die with her.
You are my queen, my sword is yours, <strong>but do not ask me to stand aside</strong>
<strong>as you climb on Drogo’s pyre. I will not watch you burn</strong>.”</p>
<p>“Is that what you fear?” Dany kissed him lightly on his broad
forehead. “I am not such a child as that, sweet ser.”</p>
<p>“<strong>You do not mean to die with him?</strong> You swear it, my queen?”</p>
<p>“<strong>I swear it</strong>,”<br><sub><em><strong>AGOT - Daenerys X</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She then proceeded with claiming her husband's khalasar's remnants as her own and demanding oaths of fealty from her retainers. These are clearly not the acts of someone who was about to embark on an unknown journey or to commit suicide. She clearly had a plan for the future.</p>
<p>Daenerys was however not entirely sure. She was gambling and she knew it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>They thought her mad</strong>, Dany realized. Perhaps she was. <strong>She would know</strong>
<strong>soon enough</strong>. If I look back I am lost.<br><sub><em><strong>AGOT - Daenerys X</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She then asked for forgiveness from Drogo, as she was about to use him as sacrifice for one of her eggs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She buried her face in it and inhaled the dark fragrance of the oils.
He smelled like grass and warm earth, like smoke and semen and horses.
He smelled like Drogo. Forgive me, sun of my life, she thought.
<strong>Forgive me for all I have done and all I must do</strong>. I paid the price, my
star, but it was too high, too high...<br><sub><em><strong>AGOT - Daenerys X</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jorah tried to persuade her to sell the eggs, Daenerys however flat-out refused, implicitly claiming that the eggs were given to her for a nobler purpose than accumulating wealth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My queen, Drogo will have no use for dragon’s eggs in the night lands.
<strong>Better to sell them in Asshai</strong>. Sell one and we can buy a ship to take
us back to the Free Cities. Sell all three and you will be a wealthy
woman all your days.”</p>
<p>“<strong>They were not given to me to sell</strong>,” Dany told him.<br><sub><em><strong>AGOT - Daenerys X</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Daenerys then implicitly told the Maegi what she was about to do:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You will not hear me scream,” Mirri responded as the oil dripped from
her hair and soaked her clothing.</p>
<p>“I will,” Dany said, “but <strong>it is not your screams I want, only your</strong>
<strong>life. I remember what you told me. Only death can pay for life.</strong>” Mirri
Maz Duur opened her mouth, but made no reply. As she stepped away,
Dany saw that the <strong>contempt was gone from the maegi’s flat black eyes</strong>;
<strong>in its place was something that might have been fear</strong>. Then there was
nothing to be done but watch the sun and look for the first star.<br><sub><em><strong>AGOT - Daenerys X</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The star she was looking for was actually a sign for her.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jhogo spied it first. “There, “ he said in a hushed voice. Dany looked
and saw it, low in the east. The first star was a comet, burning red.
Bloodred; fire red; <strong>the dragon’s tail. She could not have asked for a</strong>
<strong>stronger sign.</strong><br><sub><em><strong>AGOT - Daenerys X</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following passage however clearly states that Daenerys knew dragons would hatch with fire but she did not know that she had to offer sacrifices as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>She had sensed the truth of it long ago</strong>, Dany thought as she took a
step closer to the conflagration, <strong>but the brazier had not been hot</strong>
<strong>enough</strong>.<br><sub><em><strong>AGOT - Daenerys X</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even before she saw her dragons, she knew her plan had worked.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And <strong>something else came crashing down, bouncing and rolling</strong>, to land
at her feet; <strong>a chunk of curved rock</strong>, pale and veined with gold, broken
and smoking. The roaring filled the world, yet dimly through the
firefall Dany heard women shriek and children cry out in wonder.</p>
<p><strong>Only death can pay for life.</strong></p>
<p>And <strong>there came a second crack</strong>, loud and sharp as thunder, and the
smoke stirred and whirled around her and the pyre shifted, the logs
exploding as the fire touched their secret hearts. She heard the
screams of frightened horses, and the voices of the Dothraki raised in
shouts of fear and terror, and Ser Jorah calling her name and cursing.
No, she wanted to shout to him, no, my good knight, do not fear.for
me. The fire is mine. <strong>I am Daenerys Stormborn</strong>, daughter of dragons,
bride of dragons, <strong>mother of dragons, don’t you see?</strong> Don’t you SEE?<br><sub><em><strong>AGOT - Daenerys X</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So yes, she did know that this was gonna hatch dragon-eggs.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<ol>
<li>Daenerys knew that fire was needed to hatch the dragons. She however did not know that blood was needed as well.</li>
<li>Daenerys had a fair idea that dragons would hatch however she was not sure. This was a risk she took.</li>
<li>Daenerys was acting on a plan and it worked out. At no point did she show any intentions of committing suicide. She was planing for the future all along.</li>

<p>My question is did he or Catelyn ever come to know for sure that this was the real reason his father rebelled against the crown and got killed instead?</p>

"159110","How did people know that Varys is a eunuch?","<p>As the story begins, in the books or in the show, it is common knowledge that Varys is an eunuch. As he doesn't seem to deny it, readers or viewers quickly assume this is true.</p>

<p>However, I wonder why would he let people know his condition. Initially, there were only two people (the sorcerer and himself) that knew. So at some point, he started to tell people and let the rumor spread.</p>

<p>I don't think that this is something to brag about, but maybe Varys thought that letting people know would help him somehow. Did he intentionally let people know he was eunuch? Why?</p>

<p>His appearance might have betrayed him, but as he has some skills in disguise, he could have chosen to hide that fact. However, he seems to delight in his condition.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This is not a dupe. The target asks how can Eunuchs be told apart. This one asks if Varys is actually an eunuch and did he disclose his identity voluntarily.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","159111","<h3>Books</h3>
<p>No, the initial known discovery, if Illyrio can be believed, wasn't voluntary. At least until then Varys was ashamed of his condition and tried to hide it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In Myr he was a prince of thieves, until a rival thief informed on
him. <strong>In Pentos his accent marked him, and once he was known for a
eunuch he was despised and beaten</strong>. Why he chose me to protect him I
may never know, but we came to an arrangement. Varys spied on lesser
thieves and took their takings. I offered my help to their victims,
promising to recover their valuables for a fee. Soon every man who had
suffered a loss knew to come to me, whilst city's footpads and
cutpurses sought out Varys … half to slit his throat, the other half
to sell him what they'd stolen. We both grew rich, and richer still
when Varys trained his mice.&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>ADWD - Tyrion II</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After that it seems, Varys stopped trying to keep it a secret and embraced himself for what he was.</p>
<p>Aerys II Targaryen heard rumors of an exceptionally talented eunuch, Varys, and called him to his court. So he came to Westeros as a known Eunuch. I doubt anyone tried to make sure that he was really a Eunuch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I grew so respectable that a cousin of the Prince of Pentos let me
wed his maiden daughter, <strong>whilst whispers of a certain eunuch's
talents crossed the narrow sea and reached the ears of a certain
king</strong>. A very anxious king, who did not wholly trust his son, nor his
wife, nor his Hand, a friend of his youth who had grown arrogant and
overproud. I do believe that you know the rest of this tale, is that
not so?&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>ADWD - Tyrion II</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since everyone at court already knew he was a eunuch, what's the point of trying to hide it?</p>
<p>Not to mention, Varys looks the part. He is plump and hairless<sup>1</sup> like a Eunuch is supposed to be (As the only vice allowed to Eunuchs is eating so tend to be fat).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The Unsullied you may have seen in Pentos and Myr were household
guards. That's soft service, and <strong>eunuchs tend to plumpness in any
case. Food is the only vice allowed them</strong>. To judge all Unsullied by
a few old household slaves is like judging all squires by Arstan
Whitebeard, Your Grace. Do you know the tale of the Three Thousand of
Qohor?&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>ASOS - Daenerys  I</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>No one has ever observed him indulging into carnal desires either.</p>
<p>However, if you are asking is he really a Eunuch? The answer would be yes, unless GRRM says otherwise as the canon material only gives us Varys' word or word of other characters who probably never had the pleasure of looking at Varys' junk.</p>

<p>there is one that he can no longer sense. I assume it is Shaggydog he's refering to, but what is the significance of this?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","21267","<p>While I don't believe there has yet to be an explanation for this, I believe there are three possibilities :</p>

<ol>
<li>As Corwin stated, Rickon may be losing himself in Shaggydog</li>
<li>Rickon and Shaggydog's physical distance from the others may be causing it to become harder and harder for the others to sense him</li>
<li>Rickon and Shaggydog's physical distance from Westeros may be causing the fading</li>
</ol>

<p>My personal opinion is that Shaggydog leaving Westeros and its magic (Children of the Forest, Weirwood network, etc.) is what is causing him to fade from the other direwolves' perception. This may be somewhat backed up by the fact that Ghost can no longer sense Summer (who is beyond the Wall).</p>

<p>I don't believe option 2 is viable because we have seen that Ghost can still sense Nymeria, and based on the maps, Skagos appears to be closer to him than the South.</p>

<p>I think option 1 has merit, but with no canonical proof on how the link exists, it's hard to support. It would seem to reason that the link exists between the direwolves since Lady is no longer sensed even though Sansa is still alive. </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> In this chapter, we have Varys killing Kevan Lannister and maester Pycelle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point, we are starting to know Varys, he acts ""for the good of the realm"". That is, putting Daenerys (or Aegon (or both)) on the Iron Throne. And Kevan was threatening to fix the current political chaos and reconcile the Tyrells and the Lannisters, and that would have been an issue for the Targaryen invasion. (To be honest, I'm not convinced that the result will actually be in their favor. I suspect the armies of the Lannisters will now simply follow King Tommen, who seems to be a puppet of Margaery Tyrell. But that's beside the point.)</p>

<p>The thing I really don't understand is: why did Varys also</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> kill Pycelle? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't see why it was necessary. If anything, I would say the maester contributed to the general distrust with his shady behavior.</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","90611","<p>Short answer: Varys is making sure the powers in Kings Landing are divided and underprepared for the army they intend to put someone Varys and Illyrio 
 want to be king on the throne. He targeted Pycelle specifically because Pycelle was the one taking that threat seriously: mapping their army's movements and advocating swift action before Connington &amp; co establish a strong foothold.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Is Varys acting for the good of the realm?</strong> We only have his word for it. Based on what his co-conspirator Illyrio tells Tyrion, it seems more likely that Varys and Illyrio are conniving to put a pliant person they can influence, control and predict on the throne. They see themselves as doing what is right - people are great at self-justification - and that might be true, but it can all be explained by ambition. They achieved all they can in Pentos, then the next level up is to become the power behind the absolute ruler of an entire continent.</p>

<p>There's also a popular and convincing fan theory that there might be another level to why Varys and Illyrio want this particular person on the throne. There's <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/115364/why-does-the-golden-company-raise-the-banners-for-a-targaryen"">a detailed account of it in the top answer to this question here</a>. Warning: if this theory is true, it might be a massive spoiler for a major plot development in a future book. (Second warning: it's really long! <code>:-)</code> Very thorough and well sourced)</p>

<hr>

<p>As for ""<strong>why did he kill Pycelle?</strong>"", earlier in the epilogue, Pycelle:</p>

<ul>
<li>comes across as the person on the small council who takes the threat posed by Connington's pro-Aegon (therefore pro-Varys) adventures most seriously</li>
<li>shows a detailed map of Connington's incursions. He is clearly following news of them closely and knows more than anyone about their movements</li>
<li>suggests paying the Golden Company to betray ""Lord Connington and the pretender"" (to which, ironically, Kevan suggests seeking a loan from ""the magisters of Pentos"", i.e. Illyrio and his peers and rivals)</li>
<li>mentions that he's in conversation with Oldtown about news of Daenyrs, and encourages the rumours here to be taken seriously</li>
</ul>

<p>Everyone else is too pre-occupied with their own petty political agendas to take serious action - which is what Varys wants. Kevan risked disrupting Varys's ""divide and rule"" strategy, and Pycelle risked prompting swift action that could have snuffed out the foothold Connington was building up. </p>

<p>Pycelle's comments all touch on genuine weaknesses in the Connington conspiracy, which is reliant on sellswords and vulnerable while its landing parties try to gain a foothold.</p>

<p>Something as outrageous and un-Varys-like as blatant murder has the added bonus of stoking Cersei's waning paranoia, fuelling useful non-Connington-related intrigue and distraction. Especially since he used Tyrion's signature weapon.</p>

<p>An additional possible factor (and maybe the answer to the logical next question, why act at that exact moment), is that only Pycelle knows that a raven has landed warning that winter has arrived. It's also possible Pycelle had just receieved another message Varys wanted to not be passed on (e.g. the ""news from Storm's End"" that Kevan was expecting). </p>

<p>The common thread seems to be - <strong>Varys is making sure that King's Landing is woefully underprepared for what is coming</strong>.</p>

<p>I know she would have rejected the idea, but it seems it came to her as a surprise when Khal Moro captures her (Season 6) and his wife informs her about this.</p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","159548","<h2>Daenerys Targaryen need not be told to do anything</h2>

<p>Since you asked, in the books Dany is well aware that she needs to go and join the Dosh Khaleen:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A procession followed them out onto the godsway, the broad grassy road that ran through the heart of Vaes Dothrak, from the horse gate to the Mother of Mountains. The crones of the dosh khaleen came first, with their eunuchs and slaves. Some supported themselves with tall carved staffs as they struggled along on ancient, shaking legs, while others walked as proud as any horselord. Each of the old women had been a khaleesi once. When their lord husbands died and a new khal took his place at the front of his riders, with a new khaleesi mounted beside him, they were sent here, to reign over the vast Dothraki nation. Even the mightiest of khals bowed to the wisdom and authority of the dosh khaleen. <strong>Still, it gave Dany the shivers to think that one day she might be sent to join them, whether she willed it or no.</strong><br /><sup><em>-A Song of Ice and Fire: Book One - A Game of Thrones, Chapter Fourty-Six (<a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Game_of_Thrones-Chapter_46"" rel=""noreferrer"">Daenerys V</a>).</em> [emphasis mine]</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, when the time comes, she chooses not to as she has an epiphany and realises her true mission.<br>
In fact, Ser Jorah even tells her that he won't let her go to the Dosh Khaleen if she doesn't want to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“My... queen,” Ser Jorah said, going to one knee. “My sword that was his is yours, Daenerys. And my heart as well, that never belonged to your brother. I am only a knight, and I have nothing to offer you but exile, but I beg you, hear me. Let Khal Drogo go. You shall not be alone. <strong>I promise you, no man shall take you to Vaes Dothrak unless you wish to go. You need not join the dosh khaleen.</strong> Come east with me. Yi Ti, Oarth, the Jade Sea, Asshai by the Shadow. We will see all the wonders yet unseen, and drink what wines the gods see fit to serve us. Please, Khaleesi.<br /><sup><em>-A Song of Ice and Fire: Book One - A Game of Thrones, Chapter Seventy-Two (<a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Game_of_Thrones-Chapter_72"" rel=""noreferrer"">Daenerys X</a>).</em> [emphasis mine]</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He says this because he thinks that Dany is about to walk into Drogo's funeral pyre to commit suicide:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I understand that you loved him,” Ser Jorah said in a voice thick with despair. “I loved my lady wife once, yet I did not die with her. You are my queen, my sword is yours, but do not ask me to stand aside as you climb on Drogo’s pyre. I will not watch you burn.”<br>
  “Is that what you fear?” Dany kissed him lightly on his broad forehead. “I am not such a child as that, sweet ser.”<br>
  “You do not mean to die with him? You swear it, my queen?”<br>
  “I swear it,” she said in the Common Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms that by rights were hers.<br /><sup><em>-Ibid.</em></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Kuhleesi is dumb</h2>

<p>The problem arises when you bring the show into the mix. Unfortunately, with such a huge production, it's viable that someone might forget this minute details of the story.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the show version of Dany tends to be depicted as knowledgeable, young and even naïve, as opposed to the fiercely strong and well-informed Daenerys of the books.</p>

<p>The scene you mention in Season 6 happens to be filled with inconsistencies of show vs. books:</p>

<p><strong>Books:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The Dosh Khaleen are respected and revered</li>
<li>The Dosh Khaleen are not treated as washed up bed slaves</li>
<li>Vaes Dothrak is a majestic and large city comprised of buildings and cultures of hundreds of civilisations</li>
<li>Vaes Dothrak has buildings which match the grandeur of the captured civilisations of the Dothraki, featuring buildings with 200 rooms</li>
<li>Vaes Dothrak is a common place where all Khalasars are considered one</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Show:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Vaes Dothrak is depicted as basically a wasteland with one main ""hut"" as its central point</li>
<li>The Khals seem to be in contention and tend to follow the orders of Khal <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Moro"" rel=""noreferrer"">Moro</a></li>
<li>The Dosh Khaleen are bound to the ""hut"" and treated as washed up bed slaves</li>
<li>The Dosh Khaleen are not respected</li>
</ul>

<p>So it's easy to see how they've added in this small tid-bit of Dany being surprised or whatever at the thought of having to be taken to Vaes Dothrak to join the Dosh Khaleen.</p>

<p>The only reason I can think of for this is that when she was told she'll be taken back, it's not really a surprise to her per se, rather that she realises the gravity of the situation and is terrified or dismayed at her outcome.</p>

<p>From what I know and have seen, there has been no communication between the possible 'knowers' of the truth and <strong>Aemon</strong>.

<p>Why <em>would</em> anyone tell him anything of the sort? ""Hey Aemon, not sure if you're interested but you know that bastard kid from Winterfell? Well, he's actually ... And if he ever decides to join The Watch, just look out for him ok?"" &lt;-- doesn't make sense.</p>

"90864","How did the Shy Maid pass The Bridge of Dream twice?","<p>Minor '<em>A Dance with Dragons</em>' spoilers ahead.</p>
<hr />
<p>While crossing the Rhoyne, the <em>Shy Maid</em> encounters some trouble in the ruins of Chroyane. Just before the attack of the living slaves (to Greyscale), the Stone Men, something rather odd happens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'The Bridge of Dream,' said Tyrion. 'Inconceivable,' said Haldon Halfmaester. 'We’ve left the bridge behind. Rivers only run one way'</p>
<p><sub>A Dance with Dragons, Tyrion V</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I haven't the foggiest what happened here. From my reading the <em>Shy Maid</em> ends up passing the Bridge of Dream twice, is it known how and why this happens?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","90867","<p>This scene is a remnant of a larger chapter than GRRM excised from the book. It's meant to be spooky and confusing, and is almost certainly the result of magical interference.</p>
<p>During the trip down the river, Tyrion thinks about a mysterious creature called The Shrouded Lord. In the novel, we never see this person, and Tyrion starts thinking of him as a symbolic representation of his father.</p>
<p>From what I've heard of the original scene, Tyrion <em>meets</em> the Shrouded Lord; he is similar to other legendary beings we've met and/or heard of, in that he can make things happen that appear magical. In this case, he really did make the river behave unnaturally without anyone on the boat seeing it.</p>
<p><a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20161014221040/https://grrm.livejournal.com/22998.html?thread=2707158"" rel=""noreferrer"">Martin claims</a> he didn't like where this particular interaction took Tyrion's character, so he took most of the scene out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When that happens, maybe my heirs will decide to publish a book of fragments and deleted chapters, and you'll all get to read about Tyrion's meeting with the Shrouded Lord. It's a swell, spooky, evocative chapter, but you won't read it in DANCE. It took me down a road I decided I did not want to travel, so I went back and ripped it out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, remnants of the unnatural nature of the river are left in, making the scene intentionally surreal. Besides the obvious fact that Tyrion passes the same point on the river twice (not just the Bridge, but the entire surrounding scenery), there's also this remark from Yandry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Mother Rhoyne runs how she will&quot; murmured Yandry</p>
<p><sub>(<em>A Dance with Dragons</em>, Chapter 18: Tyrion V)</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rhoynish magic is all about water magic; this is intended to evoke that kind of idea that the river itself is magical, though the reasons why it happens are left to the imagination.</p>
<hr />
<p>There's a lot of speculation about what was in this original chapter; while we'll never know, there are some other narrative bits that seem to go nowhere that may have set up this encounter. First, we have this bit about The Shrouded Lord:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They say that the Shrouded Lord will grant a boon to any man who can make him laugh.</p>
<p><sub>(<em>A Dance with Dragons</em>, Chapter 14: Tyrion IV)</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We also learn that The Shrouded Lord might be</p>
<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
<p> The still living prince Garin,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and might be the cause of greyscale, as described in <em>The World of Ice And Fire</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And so, that very night, the Rhoyne flooded out of season and with greater force than was known in living memory. A thick fog full of evil humors fell, and the Valyrian conquerors began to die of greyscale.</p>
<p><sub>(<em>The World of Ice and Fire</em>, &quot;Ten Thousand Ships&quot;)</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One popular theory says that, in the original scene, the Rhoynish magic of the river was reacting to the presence of</p>
<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
<p> the Valyrians -- specifically, Aegon</p>
</blockquote>
<p>on the boat, making them sail under the bridge a second time so the stone men could attack. After being pulled underwater, Tyrion meets the Shrouded Lord and makes him laugh. In exchange, he's granted a boon&quot; of not catching greyscale, but only if Tyrion</p>
<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
<p> talks Aegon out of seeking out Dany for himself.</p>

"90913","Is the Game Of Thrones Telltale game series canon?","<p>I am planning to give the <em>Game Of Thrones</em> <em>Telltale</em> series of 3 episodes so far a shot. However, I am wondering if this series of games is canon. I have read here and there that this series explores the stories of a minor Northern house (House Forrester I think) and that the timeline is really close to the ASOIAF timeline (if not included in it).</p>

<p>So is the stuff written by GRRM, or at least developed with his approval rendering it hence canon?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><canon>","90923","<p>If it's canon with anything, it would be the show.  It was made using HBO's license, not one gotten direct from GRRM.  You'll note that in the logo, it matches the HBO show's style and it lacks the 'A' in <strong><em>A</strong> Game of Thrones</em>.   Also the familiar characters we see in the game are modeled after the actors from the show.</p>

<p>In terms of timeline it's between the colored weddings that we've seen in the show (i.e. post-Red Wedding, pre-Purple Wedding), at least so far.  The game's first 'season' is not complete, so we don't have the complete story yet.  As linked from the Wikipedia page, <a href=""http://www.polygon.com/2013/12/23/5224694/how-telltale-teamed-up-with-game-of-thrones-and-borderlands"">this article says</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Allison noted the Games of Thrones project, though still in early development stages, took more than a year of conversation with HBO to seal the deal — a multi-year, multi-title deal, to be exact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this first batch of episodes is just the first of several.</p>

<p>In terms of canonicity, the Wikipedia page links to <a href=""http://www.gamespot.com/articles/george-r-r-martin-s-assistant-working-with-telltale-on-game-of-thrones/1100-6419276/"">this article</a>:</p>

Martin's personal assistant Ty Corey Franck is working with Telltale Games as a ""story consultant"" for the developer's upcoming episodic series based on the acclaimed fantasy franchise.</p>

<p>So ostensibly the story should be consistent with the rest of <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p>

<p>I have not found any official evidence of <em>why</em> they have done this.

<p>Any word from D&amp;D? Any word from GRRM? Any word from HBO?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","91072","<p>There's only one answer - <strong>they're not essential (<em>yet?</em>) for the story HBO is telling</strong>. HBO's priority is making that story into one which works on television, not preserving everything from the books.</p>

<p>I say ""yet?"" because, with the possible exceptions of Arianne and Quentyn (who appear to have gone the way of Garlan Tyrell), there's always the possibility they could be introduced with adapted stories should they become necessary. For example, I was convinced Ser Dontas had been written out of the show when he didn't repeatedly meet with Sansa  like in the books, and I was expecting someone like Brienne to do an adapted version of his role. Instead, he was reintroduced at the last minute, with a much shorter version of his story, with just enough context for the plot and no more.</p>

<p><strong>It all hinges on what happens in books unwritten</strong>. We know that the show intends to very roughly follow the trajectory of the books GRRM hasn't written yet, which presumably means the fates of  the families overall and A-list characters like Dany and Tyrion will <em>broadly</em> match. Will Aegon, Euron, Victarion etc be irreplacable parts of this core story? If so, don't be surprised if they are rapidly introduced later - when they start to become essential, and no sooner.</p>

<p>Update now Season 6 is out:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Euron has suddenly appeared, and rapidly reached a point similar to where he ends in A Dance With Dragons, ready to start taking a part in the main plot. 
 <br/><br/>
 Interestingly, his actor is someone quite different to what many book readers expected - someone less suited to fearsome imposing villains, more associated with playing complex, troubled, ambiguous enigmas. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>This is why no-one involved in the show's production will <em>or should</em> comment</strong>.  If they say, for example, that Connington is definitively cut,  ruling out the possibility of him making a surprise appearance, then that's a spoiler for books that haven't been written yet. It'd  strongly suggest that he's not going to have an irreplaceable role in the central story. </p>

<p>As you said, it looks like <strong><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Syrio_Forel"">Syrio Forel</a></strong> was around King's Landing when Ned Stark was hiring.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ned frowned. The man Syrio Forel had come with an excellent reputation, and his flamboyant Braavosi style was well suited to Arya’s
  slender blade, yet still ... a few days ago, she had been wandering around with a swatch of black silk tied over her eyes. Syrio was teaching her to see with her ears and her nose and her skin, she told him. Before that, he had her doing spins and back flips. “Arya, are you certain you want to persist in this?”</p>
  
  <p>She nodded. “Tomorrow we’re going to catch cats.”</p>
  
  <p>“Cats.” Ned sighed. “Perhaps it was a mistake to hire this Braavosi. If you like, I will ask Jory to take over your lessons. Or I might have a quiet word with Ser Barristan. He was the finest sword in the Seven Kingdoms in his youth.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>2. What is the First Sword of Braavos doing in King's Landing?</em></strong></p>

<p>Syrio Forel was no longer the First Sword of Braavos. He himself mentions that.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The steel must be part of your arm,” the bald man told her. “Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos, he knows these things. Listen to him, boy.”</p>

<p>Most probably he was looking for a job.</p>

<p><strong>At this point, there isn't a lot of information on Syrio Forel.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Updating my answer based on GRRM's interview</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, I’ve never given it much thought. Ned was searching for a fencing master who could teach Arya, and he knew it couldn’t not be a conventional master at arms or a knight, or the castle master at arms, because he didn’t think his young daughter could handle a broadsword (or maybe longsword) the way man with greater strength in their torso could, so he decided the Braavosi style suited her best. Who was available in the city that might fit the bill? Obviously, somebody had to recommend him to Ned. I believe Syrio must have been in the city at the time, because there wasn’t enough time to send for someone all the way from Braavos.</p>

"91012","Does the Faith Militant use laws retroactively?","<p>I've just ended watching the episode 7 of season 5 of <em>Game of Thrones</em>. Right now the Faith Militant have</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> arrested Loras, Margery, and Cersei for different crimes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, there is something really strange in these actions. All crimes mentioned in the show have been performed <strong>before</strong> the restoration of Faith Militant. The common logic is that you cannot punish for a crime retroactively, that is, for something that a person committed before there actually was a law forbidding that.</p>

<p>Now, before the 5th season such a sin as</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> the homosexuality of Loras</p>
</blockquote>

<p>was definitely not considered a serious crime, that demanded an arrest. The Littlefinger's establishment (whore house) was actually a legal thing in the previous seasons. So, why the prosecution at all for this? I don't think that even the High Sparrow is such a big fanatic to punish someone retroactively. So, the question is. Why did they arrest</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Loras, who performed his sins before Faith Militant was actually in active state? And why did they arrest Margery, who was just a witness of a sex scene and did not even take part in it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only person they did arrest correctly, IMHO, is</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Cersei, who actually cheated on her husband.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But they don't even know that for sure! Because</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Cersei had an affair with this Pycelle character after her husband's death, which is technically not a cheat, and they have no witness confirming the twincest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, any explanation for that? AFAIK, in the books the charges were much more serious, and would be considered a crime even before the faith militant came in the game.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","91017","<p>Might makes right! Nuf said.</p>

<p>The ""High Sparrow"" has a standing army that the idiot Cersei gave him. So now he can punish whomever he wants for whatever he wants as he has soldiers protecting him.</p>

<p>In the books everything happens differently regarding Loras, his sister and Cersei, but the outcome, for Cersei at least, is the same. Ironic that it was her actions that eventually put her in that situation.</p>

<p>In the show it is a sin to have sex outside of wedlock, to have sex with the same gender, to lie, etc. Loras is accused of having sex with another male, he denied it, and a witness was found confirming to the High Septon that Loras lied. Margaery lied for his Brother so she is guilty too. That is why she is a prisoner of the Faith at the moment.</p>

<p>Now to explain why it is only now that the ""Faith Laws"" are enforced. </p>

<p>The previous High Septon had his own ""unnatural appetites"" so he couldn't accuse others when it was known that he was just as bad. Also the previous Septon didn't have an army at his beck and call. The current one does.</p>

<p>And there is a quote from the last episode when he is talking to the Queen of Thorns:</p>

Yes, there was much political tension in the land at the time, and things were surely moving into place for war, but what I would like to know is there any evidence in the book/canon material that indicates that things would not have progressed as volatility as they had if not for her actions?</p>

  “Oh,” was all Dany had time to say as he pulled her close and pressed his lips down on hers. He smelled of sweat and salt and leather, and the iron studs on his jerkin dug into her naked breasts as he crushed her hard against him. One hand held her by the shoulder while the other slid down her spine to the small of her back, and her mouth opened for his tongue, though she never told it to. His beard is scratchy, she thought, but his mouth is sweet. The Dothraki wore no beards, only long mustaches, and only Khal Drogo had ever kissed her before. He should not be doing this. I am his queen, not his woman.<br />
  It was a long kiss, though how long Dany could not have said. When it ended, Ser Jorah let go of her, and she took a quick step backward. “You... you should not have...”<br />
  “I should not have waited so Iong,” he finished for her. “I should have kissed you in Qarth, in Vaes Tolorro. I should have kissed you in the red waste, every night and every day. You were made to be kissed, often and well.” His eyes were on her breasts.<br />Dany covered them with her hands, before her nipples could betray her. “I... that was not fitting. I am your queen.”<br />
  “My queen,” he said, “and the bravest, sweetest, and most beautiful woman I have ever seen. Daenerys -<br />
  “Your Grace!”<br />
  “Your Grace,” he conceded, “the dragon has three heads, remember? You have wondered at that, ever since you heard it from the warlocks in the House of Dust. Well, here’s your meaning: Balerion, Meraxes, and Vhagar, ridden by Aegon, Rhaenys, and Visenya. The three-headed dragon of House Targaryen - three dragons, and three riders.”<br />
  “Yes,” said Dany, “but my brothers are dead.”<br />
  “Rhaenys and Visenya were Aegon’s wives as well as his sisters. You have no brothers, but you can take husbands. And I tell you truly, Daenerys, there is no man in all the world who will ever be half so true to you as me.”<br /><sup><em>-A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Three - A Storm of Swords, Chapter Eight (<a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Storm_of_Swords-Chapter_8"">Daenerys I</a>).</em></sup></p>

<p>He tells her so again when she banishes him:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I protected you. I fought for you. Killed for you.”<br />
  Kissed me, she thought, betrayed me.<br />
  “I went down into the sewers like a rat. For you.”<br />
  It might have been kinder if you’d died there. Dany said nothing. There was nothing to say.<br />
  “Daenerys,” he said, “<strong>I have loved you.</strong>”<br />
  And there it was. Three treasons will you know once for blood and once for gold and once for love.<br /><sup><em>-A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Three - A Storm of Swords, Chapter Fourty-Two (<a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Storm_of_Swords-Chapter_71"">Daenerys VI</a>).</em></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But to no avail, she banishes him and he embarks on his quest to escape the dreaded Friendzone; and fails miserably, even finds a whore in the Volantene whorehouse who looks like Dany. Oh, poor Jorah!</p>

Though Ned holds a special place in my heart, and I would love to believe that this is true, is there any real evidence in the books/show that support the claim of his swordsmanship? </p>

<p>Note: after him saying this and with it in mind, you can see that in the episode of ""Game of Thrones"" where the Lannisters apprehend Ned that he holds his own against Jaime for a short time before being stabbed, and during which time Jaime had a look on his face that seemed to acknowledge his opponents skill and enjoy the challenge.

"91175","To what do the Great Houses of Westeros owe their longevity?","<p>Why are the great houses of Westeros so long lived? For example, the Starks have been kings and later Wardens of the North for nearly 8,000 since Bran the Builder. Again, the Arryns of the Vale and the Tyrrells of the Reach have long been lords of their domain. </p>

<p>In comparable societies in Europe for example, the Habsburgs ruled for only several centuries. And in China the Qing? ruled for at least 4. Is there a precedent for houses to last this long in out time, and to what do the Great Houses of Westeros owe this longevity?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","91295","<p>Of the eight Great Houses only three have been lords of their domain for a long time: The Starks, the Lannisters and the Arryns. On the other hand, the Baratheons, the Tyrells, the Tullys and the Greyjoys owe their rise in station to the Targaryen conquests (barely 300 years old) that extinguished the Durrandons, the Gardeners and the Hoares. Similarly, the Martells only rose to prominence when they allied themselves with the Rhoynar 500-1000 years ago. </p>

<p>House Stark's reign does indeed date to at least 8000 years (although some Measters dispute those numbers due to the lack of sources) but those were far from being undisputed. The Boltons have been a constant thorn, and at least one cadet branch (the Graystarks) have attempted coupes. The fact that the Starks have remained in power is possibly due to the power sustained by the massive holdings surrounding Winterfell, and the seemingly undying loyalty of the Northmen to the Starks. </p>

<p>On a similar vein, the Lannisters massive ancestral gold mines have kept them rich enough to stay on top, while the impregnable Eyrie has kept the Arryns safe from all aggressors until the Targaryen dragons arrived. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Lord Oaf of Highgarden</p>
<p><sub>Game of Thrones, Season 3 Episode 2, &quot;Dark Wings, Dark Words&quot;</sub></p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","91281","<p>Yes, it's in the books. Olenna did call Mace Tyrell ""Lord oaf"" and much more.</p>

<p><em>A Storm of Swords</em>, chapter 6, Sansa I.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother,” said Margaery. “Father
  liked him as well, and so did Loras.”</p>
  
  <p>“Loras is young,” Lady Olenna said crisply, “and very good at knocking
  men off horses with a stick. That does not make him wise. <strong>As to your
  father, would that I’d been born a peasant woman with a big wooden
  spoon, I might have been able to beat some sense into his fat head.”</strong></p>
  
  <p>“Mother,” Lady Alerie scolded.</p>
  
  <p>“Hush, Alerie, don’t take that tone with me. And don’t call me Mother.
  If I’d given birth to you, I’m sure I’d remember. <strong>I’m only to blame
  for your husband, the lord oaf of Highgarden.</strong>”</p>
  
  <p>“Grandmother,” Margaery said, “mind your words, or what will Sansa
  think of us?”</p>
  
  <p>“She might think we have some wits about us. One of us, at any rate.”
  The old woman turned back to Sansa. “It’s treason, I warned them,
  Robert has two sons, and Renly has an older brother, how can he
  possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair? Tut-tut, says my son,
  don’t you want your sweetling to be queen? You Starks were kings once,
  the Arryns and the Lannisters as well, and even the Baratheons through
  the female line, <strong>but the Tyrells were no more than stewards until
  Aegon the Dragon came along and cooked the rightful King of the Reach
  on the Field of Fire. If truth be told, even our claim to Highgarden
  is a bit dodgy, just as those dreadful Florents are always whining.
  ‘What does it matter?’ you ask, and of course it doesn’t, except to
  oafs like my son.</strong> The thought that one day he may see his grandson
  with his arse on the Iron Throne makes Mace puff up like . . . now,
  what do you call it? Margaery, you’re clever, be a dear and tell your
  poor old half-daft grandmother the name of that queer fish from the
  Summer Isles that puffs up to ten times its own size when you poke
  it.”</p>
  
  <p>“They call them puff fish, Grandmother.”</p>
  
  <p>“Of course they do. Summer Islanders have no imagination. My son ought
  to take the puff fish for his sigil, if truth be told. He could put a
  crown on it, the way the Baratheons do their stag, mayhap that would
  make him happy. We should have stayed well out of all this bloody
  foolishness if you ask me, but once the cow’s been milked there’s no
  squirting the cream back up her udder. <strong>After Lord Puff Fish put that
  crown on Renly’s head, we were into the pudding up to our knees</strong>, so
  here we are to see things through. And what do you say to that,
  Sansa?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And again in the same chapter.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As the servants brought out a broth of leeks and mushrooms,
  Butterbumps began to juggle and Lady Olenna pushed herself forward to
  rest her elbows on the table. <strong>“Do you know my son, Sansa? Lord Puff
  Fish of Highgarden?”</strong></p>
  
  <p>“A great lord,” Sansa answered politely.</p>
  
  <p>“<strong>A great oaf,” said the Queen of Thorns. “His father was an oaf as
  well. My husband, the late Lord Luthor.</strong> Oh, I loved him well enough,
  don’t mistake me. A kind man, and not unskilled in the bedchamber, but
  an appalling oaf all the same. He managed to ride off a cliff whilst
  hawking. They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to
  where his horse was taking him.</p>
  
  <p>“<strong>And now my oaf son is doing the same, only he’s riding a lion instead
  of a palfrey. It is easy to mount a lion and not so easy to get off, I
  warned him, but he only chuckles.</strong> Should you ever have a son, Sansa,
  beat him frequently so he learns to mind you. I only had the one boy
  and I hardly beat him at all, so now he pays more heed to Butterbumps
  than he does to me. A lion is not a lap cat, I told him, and he gives
  me a ‘tut-tut-Mother.’ There is entirely too much tut-tutting in this
  realm, if you ask me. All these kings would do a deal better if they
  would put down their swords and listen to their mothers.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But no he's not that foolish. Mace knows that the Lannisters need him, and tries to use this for the benefit of his house and for personal benefit as well. Maybe he is too ambitious and sometimes this blinds him, like when he approached Cersei during the funeral of Lord Tywin (AFFC, chapter 7, Cersei) and hinted that he wants the Hand's position, and also reminded her that Tywin did promise the position of Master of Coins to his Uncle. This angers Cersei and in the end no Tyrells make it in Cersei's small council. So Mace serving under Cersei happens only in the TV show.</p>

In <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, bastards ""who have no name of their own"" get a surname like Snow, Rivers, or Stone, based on where they are from.  Does this apply only to the illegitimate children of nobles, or to the illegitimate children of the small folk as well? </p>

<p>Presumably, in a feudal society commoners do not have surnames at all, so it would be strange if their bastards did.</p>

<p>Just to clarify, I was thinking about cases when it is not known for a fact whether the child is a bastard of a noble.  For example, Mya Stone was not acknowledged by her father, yet she is still a Stone.  So then we have an interesting situation in Westeros: people who have last names are either nobles or bastards (with or without noble blood).</p>

<p>As per an <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/2999"">e-mail correspondence</a>, George RR Martin confirms that the bastard names are given to nobles' children, and not peasants (as they would not have last names):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bastard names are given only to bastards with at least one parent of high birth. So the bastard child of two peasants would have no surname at all.<br />

"22488","How do people in A Song of Ice and Fire universe survive multi-year winters?","<p>How exactly do the people survive the multi-year winters as far as feeding themselves? </p>

<p>You can't grow crops in winter. Nor can you feed your livestock off what grows. But ordinarily you can't save food for people or animals for multi-year periods, because it will spoil.</p>

<p>Do they have some extra-advanced refrigeration technology allowing them to store grains, animal feed etc. for many years? </p>

<p>In addition, since you can't predict how long the winter will be, you don't know how much to stockpile; and the summer may be significantly shorter than winter, so you either have to front-load all your stockpiling on the first couple of years, or starve in case the winter is much longer than summer.</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","22491","<p>First off... an unusually long winter is its own refrigeration. You don't need the Frigidaire when it's -10F outside. (Of course, waiting for it to come, things would spoil.)</p>

<p>I'm only a lowly agriculture student and hardly an expert, but even today with mechanized agriculture, it's tough to grow enough hay for livestock for a 3-4 month winter. Farmers will buy it shipped in from other places. If you figure a 5-7 month growing season is typical, and a 4 month winter, well obviously we're breaking even (as a whole), and putting away a little extra (when droughts happen, we can often ship in hay from other places in the summer without using everything we'll need for the coming winter). But this extra is going to be 50%, maybe 100% or even %150-200 (in a good year, and only locally) of what we need.</p>

<p>Boosting the growing season would help. If in 5 months you can grow (mostly) enough for a 5 month winter, then in theory a 10 year summer might (mostly) allow enough for a 10 year winter. Except... hay isn't just dead grass. It's semi-dried plants and if it dries out too much it loses much of its nutritive value (and if it stays too damp, it gets moldy!). Even if you were rotating, eventually you'd be storing this stuff longer than a year or two, and you'd see lots of spoilage and even it drying out and crumbling to dust. While the winter can refrigerate, the wait for it can be much too long. I don't see how decade long summers would help to save enough away for even a 2 year long winter.</p>

<p>And that's just for livestock.</p>

<p>Humans can't eat hay. They need fresh vegetables at least every couple of months, or scurvy sets in. It will kill, it will kill much sooner than the end of a 5 year winter. And while you could freeze and thaw vegetables, the extra-long summer doesn't allow you to do this except at the very last moment. So you can't save up 10 years worth of onions and carrots and lemons and whatever else.</p>

<p>Now, other objections can be waved away. Seeds wouldn't last 10 years in our world, but in a world where plants have adapted to this, I assume most would. Our orchard trees would need periodic winters for dormancy, but that will have been adapted out in their world.</p>

<p>But this rest? The inhabitants can't have anything resembling human biochemistry I'm afraid. And on top of that, the logistics would be intractable even for our own level of technology (remember, the government was able to plan to save a few hundred thousand out of hundreds of millions for a short 18 month nuclear winter). </p>

"91670","Why did Mance Rayder unite the clans?","<p>The King-Beyond-the-Wall, Mance Rayder, united the clans of the wildlings to save them from the terrible fate that awaits them in the long winter.</p>

<p>In the fifth season of <em>Game of Thrones</em>, he claims that it is his only motivation for doing that. To save his people. And twice in this season it is mentioned that it took him twenty years or so.</p>

<p>But this seems odd, for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The summer lasted for ten years, so the last winter was more than that, and probably not very long either (I want to say three years, but I'm not sure).</p></li>
<li><p>The first documented sight of the White Walkers was quite recently.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Presumably the Free Folk know about the Walkers for a longer time now, but 20 years seems to go through at least one winter where nothing happened. If something had happened, there would have been repercussions (like many people fleeing south, and the word eventually reaching beyond the wall).</p>

<p><strong>How did Mance know to start uniting the clans 20 years ago?</strong></p>

<p>(Some minor timeline additions I feel obligated to make after re-watching S01E04. Ser Alliser tells Jon and Sam that during last winter he was part of a ranging party beyond the wall because they heard Mance was planning to attack the wall; and they got stuck for six months. So at least as far as TV canon goes, Mance was already powerful during last winter which is at least a decade ago.)</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","91737","<p>How much time it took Mance to unite clans, according to the books from 10 to 12 years.</p>

<p>In the very first chapter of the AGOT, Bran.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>It was the ninth year of summer, and the seventh of Bran’s life.</strong></p>
  
  <p>The man had been taken outside a small holdfast in the hills. <strong>Robb
  thought he was a wildling, his sword sworn to Mance Rayder, the
  King-beyond-the-Wall.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bran was born in 290 AC, so the chapter takes place in 297-298 AC. By this time Mance is already known as King beyong the Wall.</p>

<p>ASOS, chapter 7, Jon.</p>

<p>Mance says that he has seen Jon twice. First time -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You were just a boy, and I was all in black, one of a dozen riding
  escort to old Lord Commander Qorgyle when he came down to see your
  father at Winterfell. I was walking the wall around the yard when I
  came on you and your brother Robb. It had snowed the night before, and
  the two of you had built a great mountain above the gate and were
  waiting for someone likely to pass underneath.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jon was born in 283 AC. Jon playing in the yard and building mountain of snow, well that makes him at least 3 years old (even in fantasy world a boy has to be old enough for certain things). So this event takes place in 286-287.</p>

<p>Now simple math, Mance deserted in 286 and in 298 he's King beyond the Wall, so at worst it took 12 years to unite clans. Mance deserted in 287 and in 297 he's King beyond the Wall, so at best it took 10 years to unite clans.</p>

<p>Motives and why did Mance united clans, well that's the hardest part of your question. We don't have Mances pov in the books and I don't recall him saying what his motives are. So we have to rely on other characters.</p>

<p>AGOT, chapter 57, Bran.</p>

<p>Bran has conversation with <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Osha"">Osha</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Are there truly giants beyond the Wall?” he asked Osha, uncertainly.</p>
  
  <p>“Giants and worse than giants, Lordling. I tried to tell your brother
  when he asked his questions, him and your maester and that smiley boy
  Greyjoy. <strong>The cold winds are rising, and men go out from their fires
  and never come back … or if they do, they’re not men no more, but only
  wights, with blue eyes and cold black hands.</strong> Why do you think I run
  south with Stiv and Hali and the rest of them fools? <strong>Mance thinks
  he’ll fight, the brave sweet stubborn man, like the white walkers were
  no more than rangers, but what does he know? He can call himself
  King-beyond-the-Wall all he likes, but he’s still just another old
  black crow who flew down from the Shadow Tower. He’s never tasted
  winter. I was born up there, child, like my mother and her mother
  before her and her mother before her, born of the Free Folk. We
  remember.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually this passage once more confirms that Mance has not spent 20 years uniting clans, as Osha points out - <strong>He’s never tasted winter</strong>. Mance has not spent winter beyond the wall. And if we believe in Oshas words, Mance is going to fight Others. So that's your motive, if you have to fight others and wights you need an army. As to how Mance knew about others, well he might not but as Osha says <strong>We (Free Folk) remember</strong>.</p>

<p>As to why free folk attacked the Wall, I do recall Jon saying that free folk was not attacking the wall because of feud with Night's Watch, but because they were fleeing from something more terrible than swords and arrows of Night's Watch. And Mance was looking for safe house for his wife and his unborn child. I'll look in the books for direct quote and will include it later.</p>

<p>Maybe 20 years is a TV canon, but that doesn't comply with the books.</p>

<p>Besides, Tormund is not a reliable character. If Tormund is trusted then we have to believe that he has bedded bear and the bear has bitten half of his member but his member is still thrice in size compared to Mance's. Also he has spent some time in the belly of a sleeping giant and when the same giant woke up, took Tormund for her babe and suckled him for 3 moons turn. (this last paragraph is not part of the answer, but couldn't resist myself of not pointing out Tormund's exploits)</p>

<p>ADWD, chapter 13, Bran. This chapter is a good source, it has all the answers for your questions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All around him, wights were rising from beneath the snow. Two, three,
four. Bran lost count. They surged up violently amidst sudden clouds
of snow. Some wore black cloaks, some ragged skins, some nothing.
<strong>All of them had pale flesh and black hands. Their eyes glowed like pale blue starts.</strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Bran filled a fist with snow and threw it, but the wight did bot so
much as blink. A black hand fumbled at his face, another at his belly.
Its fingers felt like iron. He's going to pull my guts out. But
suddenly Summer was between them. Bran glimpsed skin tear like cheap
cloth, heard the splintering of bone. <strong>He saw a hand and wrist rip
loose</strong>, pale fingers wriggling, the sleeve faded black roughspun.
Black, he thought, he's wearing black, he was one of the Watch. Summer
flung the arm aside, twisted, and sank his teeth into the dead man;s
neck under the chin. When the big grey wolf wrenched free, he took
most of the creature's throat out in an explosion of pale rotten meat.
<strong>The severed hand was still moving. Bran rolled away from it</strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&quot;Hoooodor&quot; came whimper, from somewhere down below. And suddenly he
was not Bran, the broken boy crawling through the snow, suddenly he
was Hodor halfway down the hill, with the wight raking at his eyes.
Roaring, he came lurching to his feet, throwing the thing violently
aside. It went to one knee, began to rise again. Bran ripped Hodor's
longsword from his belt. Deep inside he could hear poor Hodor
whimpering still, but outside he was seven feet of fury with old iron
in his hand. He raised the sword and brought it down upon the dead
man, grunting as the blade sheared through wet wool and rusted mail
and rotted leather, biting deep into the bones and flesh beneath.
&quot;Hodor!&quot; he bellowed, and slashed again. <strong>This time he took the
wight's head off at the nek, and for a half moment he exulted... until
a pair of dead hands came groping blindly for his throat.</strong></p>

"91763","Do we know the age of Robb and Jon?","<p>I would like to know whether Robb or Jon is older. I, for myself, haven't read the books. So do we know the (exact?) birth-dates of those ""siblings"" and can compare them?</p>

<p>As far as I know, we can't date Jon's birth exactly, as we don't know for sure who his mother is. But maybe we can assure a precise span of time? I think that Robb's birth, on the other hand, should be clear.</p>

<p><strong>So how old are Robb Stark and Jon Snow?</strong></p>

<p>Credits for the wise soul which can tell if there is a difference in the show and the books. I don't think there is one, but if I have to specify, I would like to know the ages in the books.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many men fathered bastards. Catelyn had grown up with that knowledge. It came as no surprise to her, in the first year of her marriage, to learn that Ned had fathered a child on some girl chance met on campaign. He had a man’s needs, after all, and they had spent that year apart, Ned off at war in the south while she remained safe in her father’s castle at Riverrun. Her thoughts were more of Robb, the infant at her breast, than of the husband she scarcely knew. He was welcome to whatever solace he might find between battles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I read this to say that Robb was conceived before Ned went off to war, while Jon was conceived during the war. (Obviously assuming that Catelyn's understanding of the situation is correct)</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>In season 6, we discover that Jon Snow is not Ned's son after all, but rather the son of his sister (Lyanna Stark) and Rhaegar Targaryen.  This is in contradiction to Catelyn's understanding of the situation and so invalidates the quote above as a legitimate source for this answer.  </p>

"91866","What’s the real-world origin of the name Azor Ahai?","<p>Azor Ahai is some mythical hero, who may or may not coincide with other mythical heros that are supposed to be born and save us from the eternal night (which is dark and full of terrors, if we are to believe Melisandre).</p>

<p>But I'm interested in the origins of the name, here, in our world. More specifically because in Hebrew ""Azor Ahai"" means (albeit ungrammatically) ""Help my brothers"", or if you transliterate it differently you'd get ""The Living Help"". </p>

<p>Since writers often take meaningful names to be terms from other languages (and mangle them a bit), I can't help but wonder <strong>Did GRRM reveal the origin of the name ""Azor Ahai"" at some point?</strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","92690","<p><strong>I have done a fair amount of research and have found nothing <em>specific</em> about the origins of the name <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Azor_Ahai"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Azor Ahai</a>.</strong></p>
<h2>Let's talk names</h2>
<p>In general though, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_R._R._Martin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>George R. R. Martin</strong></a> tends to create his names based on what he wants them to <em>sound</em> like. As per the below youtube video:</p>

            </div></div></p>
<p>His main points within that interview are:</p>
<ul>
<li>He dislikes most Fantasy names (e.g. Riznakh)</li>
<li>He has tried many methods of name creation</li>
<li>Including those funny online name generators</li>
<li>Baby name books</li>
<li>He wants his names to be meaningful</li>
<li>He wants his names to &quot;fit&quot; and &quot;sound right&quot;</li>
<li>This can be based on whether the person is &quot;important&quot; or not, ethnicity / exoticness within the story, etc</li>
<li>He bases his names on existing or historical figures, but usually gives them a slight twist so as to sound realistic and relatable</li>
<li>John becomes Jon, Edward becomes Eddard, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's important to point out though that The George takes a lot of care in choosing his names, pretty much all of them are chosen with purpose and a huge deal of thought. It wouldn't be surprising if some of them had deeper philosophical or religious import to them.</p>
<p>See also: <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/37293/21267"">How did George R. R. Martin come up with the names of his characters?</a> where <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/37354/21267"">@SystemDown points out about GRRM's name choices</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Coming up with the names for the characters is very tough. They can't be too weird (with like apostrophies and stuff) and they can't be too &quot;real&quot;, like Francois or Patrick or any kind of a name that is tied to a place (Sandor being a Hungarian name was unintentional) <br /><sup><em>-http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1316.</em></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is also an excellent break-down of GRRM's (possible) name choices and meanings in <a href=""http://history-behind-game-of-thrones.com/characters/grrm-symbol-names"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a>, published by Jamie Adair, in <em>History of Game of Thrones</em>, July 7<sup>th</sup> 2014, in which Jamie points out that some of GRRM's names are used in honour or as a reference to real-life people. But again, unfortunately, nothing specific about <strong>Azor Ahai</strong></p>
<h2>Come on, be specific</h2>
<p>The closest break-down we have on the name <strong>Azor Ahai</strong> is from <a href=""http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/88313-name-meanings;-azor-ahai-drogo-etc/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this thread on Westeros.org</a>, where user &quot;King of Winters&quot; points out that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I always thought Azor Ahai meant &quot;A Helper&quot;, Azor, &quot;Favoured By God&quot;, Ahai.<br />
I think they're from the Jewish language</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As well as our own user Eran Medan <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/91866/origin-of-the-name-azor-ahai?noredirect=1#comment208226_91866"">pointing out in the comments</a> that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, at least can confirm that as a Hebrew speaker, it roughly means &quot;help my brothers&quot; azor is עזור and ahai looks like achai/akhai אחיי, or a bit less similarly &quot;the living&quot; e.g. החיי but I have no clue if this is what he meant</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Where to next?</h2>
<p>The only thing left is for either GRRM to write the meaning of the name within one of the chapters of the story, or to discuss the name specifically in one of his myriad interviews, until then, this is all we have to go by.</p>
<h2>But it's what <em>I</em> think that matters</h2>
<p>Ok, my personal opinion on the matter is that the name Azor is GRRM's invented derivative of the word <strong><a href=""http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/azure"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Azure</a></strong>. Azure, as defined by dictionary.com means:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>adjective</strong></p>

"22702","What is the shape of the world of Westeros and do the Westerosi know?","<p>For quite some time now I have been asking myself how the world of <em>Game of Thrones</em> is shaped and if the people living in that world know the shape. </p>

<p>In questions here on SciFi.Stackexchange concerning the unnatural seasons or the definition of a year in Westeros, it is often <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/22701/2037"">argued</a> that the Westerosi can measure the duration of a revolution of their planet around the sun. But that only works if they know that they actually live on a planet. </p>

<p>In <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/3557/2037"">this</a> answer it was said that people have been travelling in ships around the world. However, I cannot remember any passage in the books supporting this. Actually I only remember evidence for the opposite: </p>

<ol>
<li>During the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Feast_for_Crows-Chapter_19"" rel=""noreferrer"">Kingsmoot</a> on the Iron Islands, there is a man called <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Gylbert_Farwynd"" rel=""noreferrer"">Gylbert Farwynd</a> who promises the Ironborn treasures from lands far to the west, if they elect him as king. However, the POV character of that chapter (I think it was Victarion Greyjoy) does not believe him and sees the madness in Gylbert's eyes - as if speaking of travelling west is crazy. </li>
<li>Later when he leads the attack against the Shield Islands, the Iron Fleet travels out of sight of the coast line. This manoeuvre is considered very dangerous and risky. If this is already dangerous, traveling even further west appears close to suicide.</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition, there was a <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Brandon_Stark_%28Shipwright%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">Brandon Stark</a> who sailed to the far west and never returned.</p>

<p><a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/3547/does-the-song-of-ice-and-fire-take-place-in-a-hollow-world"">A prior thread on this site</a> establishes that the world is not a hollow world, but is not conclusive as to whether it is a planet.</p>

"161207","How can Sansa Stark be forced to marry?","<p>In the sixth episode in season three ""The Climb"", Sansa Stark is set to marry Loras Tyrell, but is told by Tyrion that he is to marry her. We do know this is not what she wants at all as she is crying when what seems to be Loras Tyrell's ship sailing away.</p>

<p>What I don't understand is,</p>

<ul>
<li>She is still a child even though she has ""Flowered"" (Tryion says this
when protesting the arrangement to his father), I would imagine being the same as an under-aged person in current times</li>
<li>Being that her Mother is still alive at this time, it would only be
logical that she is the only one who could decide who her daughter
was to marry</li>
<li>Being that she is captive, being made to get married under duress
would not make the marriage official , which would mean Tyrion
Lannister would have no claim to the North</li>
<li>That they are married before the Gods, if is was forced, would the
church accept it as official.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>So with those reasons stated, how can Sansa be forced to marry and have it stand as an official marriage?</strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","161217","<p>You need to understand the point and strength of a king. The king of the land can force through basically anything he wants, re-writing history if he so chooses, and all subjects of the king submit to his will, or you deny his rule, and so are acting in rebellion. </p>

<p>It really doesn't matter what Sansa's say in the matter is (or her parents, or anybody's except the kings say in the matter), or whether she was married once ""flowered"" or betrothed to someone her parents didn't agree with from the moment of her birth. </p>

<p>The only reason kings don't go full despot on their subjects is doing so tends to incite rebellion (as seen with why Robert Baratheon leads a rebellion in the first place). The North is already in open revolt, so the Lannisters (who are controlling Joffrey right now) don't need to worry about what they think, and are using Joffrey's power as the king to cement a claim to Winterfell through marriage (and eventually a half-Lannister, half-Stark child).</p>

<p>Now if the king were to fall, any other King could choose to undo the marriage (as they could do if any subject was forced to get married and they didn't agree with the decision), but the point is that all decisions are subject to whomever can enforce them.</p>

<p>It may well be that there would be people in the North who would never accept a marriage of Sansa that Ned or Caitlyn didn't agree to, but unless they overthrow the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, there's nothing they can do but submit to his decision.</p>

"92776","How do Southern people discern Night's Watch deserters from truthful brothers sent south?","<p>Night's Watch deserters are sentenced to death, as we've seen in the very first episode of Game of Thrones.
A man dressed all in black is apprehended by Stark men and brought before Lord Eddard Stark.
Lord Stark sees him as a deserter and sentences him to die (and then executes that death penalty).</p>

<p>However, there are men of the Night's Watch south of the Wall, on a legitimate mission or on some kind of allowed leave.
For instance, we have Benjen Stark visiting Winterfell when the king and his party is there.
There is also Yoren, who travels around Westeros in search of new recruits.</p>

<p>I could imagine that the Warden of the North (and other lords in the northern part of Westeros) would have a good idea of who would be allowed further south and whose appearance would raise suspicion.
But I reckon the southern lords don't have as many visits from the Night's Watch, so they might not know who would be allowed to be there and who wouldn't.</p>

<p>How would lords who are rather unfamiliar with the specific brothers of the Night's Watch discern deserters from brothers sent out for some reason?</p>

<p>That ends my question, but there is a spoiler from the <strong>season 5 finale</strong> that continues the question a bit more:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Sam is sent to Oldtown to become a Maester, so he can replace Maester Aemon at Castle Black.
 But he is riding together with Gilly (a woman!) and her baby (a baby!), which might raise a lot of suspicion from people who don't know what he is sent out to do.
 What prevents southern lords of sentencing Sam as a deserter from the Night's Watch?</p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","92781","<p>As mentioned in comments, a Night's Watch brother on official business could have a document authorising him to leave the Wall, bearing the Lord Commander's seal.</p>

<p>To be clear, a sealed medieval document does not have to be sealed <em>shut</em>. It was common to <a href=""https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/manuscriptsandspecialcollections/researchguidance/medievaldocuments/authentication.aspx"">affix a seal</a> to the bottom of a document on a ribbon, as in this example:</p>

<p><img src=""https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/ManuscriptsandSpecialCollections/Images-Multimedia/ResearchGuidance/ReadingMedievalDocuments/RAO12-Ne-D-3846.jpg"" alt=""Document with attached seal""></p>

<p>The people the brother met (including nobles) might be illiterate. However, they <em>would</em> be able to recognise the picture on seal of the Lord Commander -- which would be particularly well known in the North.</p>

<p>As for what happens in the South: Night's Watch deserters are much more likely to be found in the North. It's a very long way from the Wall to King's Landing -- and any deserters who get that far would probably manage to steal some clothes along the way, so they are no longer wearing Night's Watch black.</p>

<p>So, authorities in the South don't have much reason to be suspicious of travellers dressed entirely in black -- any such people they encounter are likely to be Night's Watch brothers on official business, not deserters.</p>

Once that happened, hope was gone. Blindness was common when the stone reached the face. In the final stages the curse turned inward, to muscles, bones, and inner organs.</p>

"92885","Why doesn't House Baratheon/House Durrandon have a Valyrian Steel Blade?","<p>The Stormlands and it's inhabitants seem to have a theme of being the most war-like of the Seven Kingdoms, similar to how the Westerlands theme deals with wealth and trickery, the Vale with honour etc, House Durrandon even have ""Ours is the Fury"" as their house words so why did they in the hundreds of years when they were independent kings acquire a Valyrian Steel blade ? </p>

<p>You would expect as a more martially oriented house to be even more interested in acquiring one than the Lannisters for example. </p>

<p>I included House Baratheon in the title because as they are in spirit and in blood the modern day successor to the Durrandons.</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","92898","<p><strong>TL;DR We don't know, but probably they never got the chance to acquire one.</strong></p>

<p>We know next to nothing about how the handful of Valyrian steel blades known to exist came to Westeros in the first place. Their distribution among the noble Westerosi Houses also doesn't tell us much. It doesn't seem to be a matter of wealth (in order to buy one), since the fabulously rich Tyrells (and their predecessors the Gardiners) are not known to have ever possessed one, yet the dirt poor Mormonts have had Longclaw for at least 500 years. It also doesn't seem to be a matter of political power since of the seven Houses that controlled the Seven Kingdoms pre-conquest only the Starks and the Lannisters have had Valyrian swords, yet the majority of the known Valyrian swords are distributed among several lesser vassal Houses.</p>

<p>This leads me to believe that acquiring a Valyrian steel blade is a matter of circumstance. Valyria is the only known source of Valyrian steel (House Targaryen has the distinction of being the only House to have possessed <em>two</em> Valyrian steel swords), so we can assume that the Westerosi blades exchanged hands (through war or artifice) until they reached their current owners. House Durrendan (and by extension House Baratheon) may have not had the good fortune of getting a chance of acquiring one.</p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","93014","<p>First, a man who helps Arya in season 2  is not necessarily also a man training her in season 5. A man may have many faces, and a face of no-one may appear on many men. It is known.</p>

<p>Whatever a man intends to do, it appears more complex than simply helping a girl become no-one.</p>

<p>And there's yet another layer to the mystery. A few things we learn about those dungeon black cells in the books, mostly in AFFC:</p>

<ul>
<li>The man in charge of them (therefore, in charge of  keeping Jaqen imprisoned), Rugen,  was a mysterious character, ""no friends, no kin"", ""The other turnkeys were afraid of him"", ""was seldom here"", ""came and went as he pleased"". He appeared under mad Aerys (not long after Aerys hired Varys), and disappeared after Tyrion's escape (leaving behind a coin that caused Cersei to suspect the Tyrells were behind this)</li>
<li>Jaime, while  pretending to ""investigate"" Tyrion's ""mysterious"" disappearance, appears to know  some secret about who he really is:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Rugen"" the old man supplied. ""An undergaoler. He had charge of the
  third level, the black cells."" </p>
  
  <p>""Tell me of him,"" Jaime had to say. A
  bloody farce. <strong>He knew who Rugen was, even if [this old man] did not.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Very few people were kept in the cells (quote from the above old man):</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>...we had Grand Maester Pycelle for a time, and before him Lord Stark the
  traitor. There were three others, common men, but Lord Stark gave them
  to the Night's Watch. I did not think it good to free those three, but
  the papers were in proper order</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Those three are clearly Jaqen, Rorge and Biter - and the timing of that last point doesn't quite add up. Ned was dismissed the day after Yoren arrived late at night looking for ""scum"" to recruit from the dungeons.  Doing the paperwork over breakfast that morning doesn't seem right, and nor does doing it after his  reinstatement. Even if Ned had had time to, he'd have been unlikely to judge Rorge and Biter worthy of becoming brothers to his brother. Did someone else (Rugen perhaps?) forge the papers sending  these three dangerous men north?</li>
<li>Rugen's description also precisely matches that of the ""grizzled"", stubbly gaoler Varys disguises himself as in AGOT when visiting Ned in the black cells...</li>
</ul>

<p>Yeah,  we can safely assume that Rugen is one of Varys's disguises. </p>

<p>This means Varys was in control of the black cells.</p>

<p><strong>This  suggests, Jaqen was essentially Varys's prisoner - <em>or  his guest</em>.</strong> </p>

<p>Alongside a cannibal and a twisted sadist. An interesting selection of guests... </p>

<p>It makes sense that a master assassin making investigations would cross paths with that city's master spy - and whether they decide to be enemies or allies, they will want to keep a close eye on each other.</p>

<p>I've also always thought that a black cell with an unlocked door and a cooperative master spy jailer, connected to a secret network of tunnels, would be a convenient base for an assassin to conduct investigations. And it'd explain why Rorge and Biter were terrified of him, if he habitually escapes, <em>then comes back</em>.</p>

<p>Varys would have been able to prevent Yoren taking them, had he wanted to, and may have gone as far as forging the paperwork to have Yoren take them north.</p>

<p>Why? A user does not know... but it adds an interesting dimension to the mystery. </p>

<li>Adultery</li>
<li>Fornication</li>
<li>Incest</li>
<li>Regicide</li>
</ul>

In the Westerosi custom, The Faith is still an extremely important part of their culture.</p>

<p>You saw the way that the ""smallfolk"" (commoners) behaved towards her during her Walk of Shame. Now imagine if she was to order the death of like hundreds even thousands of people. There would be outrage and ""the many"" (smallfolk) would realise that they can stand-up against ""the few"" (the Lords).</p>

<p><strong>The easiest road</strong><br>
Now, at this point, all she has to do, is name a Champion, who would defend her. And given that her champion seems to be <strong><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Robert_Strong"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ser Robert Strong</a></strong>, who is a humongous Knight, theorised to be</p>

<p><strong>It's a huge gamble</strong>, but Cersei is insanely over-confident and well, just plain, <em>insane</em>. (but she's not so insane as to kill everybody).

<p>In the book he's not the one who forced her to do that. It was her father.</p>

<p>As to whether Robin is his son--I doubt that. It's possible, but unlikely, namely because the chance of discovery if they had an affair was too high. And, it's better for him if the heir is legit.</p>

<p>By the time Sweet Robin was spawned, Baelish was much more cautious, and while he might hold out the idea of love to Lysa, it was possible that he didn't actually have sex with her. A legitimate heir is better for him.</p>

<p>But no. <strong>Baelish never did hint or say that Robin was his secret son (and neither did Lysa for that matter, and she was nuts enough to spill any large truth before she went bye-bye out the door).</strong> That is not to say the possibility does not exist, just that it hasn't been laid out this way.

<p>It was from the first book of <em>A Song Of Ice And Fire</em> and it was Varys asking Tyrion a riddle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A King, a priest, a rich man and a sellsword are in a room. Those three man tell the sellsword to kill the other two.<br />
Who lives and who dies?</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm glad that user found the quote they were looking for now, but — not having read the series <em>yet</em> — I'd like to know the answer to the riddle. And what is the moral of the story?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","162002","<p>The exact quote from the book: (Tyrion talking to Varys):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The king, the priest, the rich man — who lives and who dies? Who will the swordsman obey? It's a riddle without an answer, or rather, too many
  answers. All depends on the man with the sword.<br><br>
  ""And yet he is no one,"" Varys said. ""He has neither crown nor gold nor favor of the gods, only a piece of pointed steel.""<br><br>
  ""That piece of steel is the power of life and death.""<br><br>
  ""Just so … yet if it is the swordsmen who rule us in truth, why do we pretend our kings hold the power? Why should a strong man with a sword ever obey a child king like Joffrey, or a wine-sodden oaf like his father?""<br><br>
  ""Because these child kings and drunken oafs can call other strong men, with other swords.""<br> 
  ""Then these other swordsmen have the true power. Or do they? Whence came their swords? Why do they obey?"" Varys smiled. ""<strong>Some say knowledge is power. Some tell us that all power comes from the gods. Others say it derives from law</strong>. Yet that day on the steps of Baelor's Sept, our godly High Septon and the lawful Queen Regent and your ever so knowledgeable servant were as powerless as any cobbler or cooper in the crowd. Who truly killed Eddard Stark do you think? Joffrey, who gave the command? Ser Ilyn Payne, who swung the sword? Or ... another?""
  <br> <br> Tyrion cocked his head sideways. ""Did you mean to answer your damned riddle, or only to make my head ache worse?""<br><br>
  Varys smiled. ""<strong>Here, then. Power resides where men believe it resides. No more and no less</strong>""<br><sub><strong><em>- A Clash of Kings - Tyrion II</em></strong></sub></p>

<p>As people said in the comments, it is the swordsman who really decides who has the power depending on what <em>his</em> beliefs are and there is no answer depending only on the three ""powerful"" people of the riddle.</p>

<p>If the swordsman is religious, he will listen to the priest, and respectively for the king and the rich man. To find out who really has power, we need to find out who the people <em>believe</em> has the power.</p>

"93508","Which of the great houses of Westeros are standing at the end of season five/ADWD?

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> both Margy and Loras are rotting in a dungeon. With a possible chance of meeting Ned Stark real soon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>How many Great Houses didn't have their heirs decimated and main branch pruned by the GRRM Reaper, at this point of the story?</strong></p>

<p>(I am aware that there might be differences between the show and the book. I'm interested in both, if possible. I also don't consider the Targaryans that great either.)</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","93514","<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Many of the <strong>big name</strong> Houses are, as you point out, not in great shape anymore. But there are more Great Houses than you probably realized, and not all of them are doing badly. A handful of them are on the verge of going extinct, but just as many are still going strong, and possibly improved their position recently.</p>

<hr>

<p>If we use the typical definition of a Great House as being a House which has it's own vassal houses, then there are nine that still existed at some point during:</p>

<h2>The Good</h2>

<p>On the one hand, a couple of the Great Houses look to be getting along just fine, and if anything, have improved their position during the War of the Five Kings:</p>

<p><strong>House Martell:</strong> In the books, Prince Doran has three children: Arianne, Quentyn, and Trystane, and by Dornish Law, Arianne is the heir to the throne, which I assume means she would keep the Martell name. </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Quentyn, unfortunately, is dead by dragon accident. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the show, they skipped the first two kids and went right for Trystane, who's heir to Sunspear. In both cases, he has been happily betrothed to Myrcella Baratheon, the King's elder sister, for most of the series.</p>

<p><strong>House Bolton:</strong> Thanks to their alliance with the Lannisters, Roose Bolton not only gets promoted to Great House (supplanting the Starks and taking their former sworn houses), he also has a legitimate heir in Ramsay. As Ramsay is now married, the line should continue through him:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> with Sansa Stark in the show, or Jeyne Pool (fake Arya Stark), in the novels; both have managed to escape at this point, however, so Ramsay may be out of luck.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If not Ramsay, then Roose's wife is pregnant, so there's another possible heir on the way.</p>

<p><strong>House Frey:</strong> Walder Frey has a nearly endless supply of male heirs waiting in line, and there's already a second generation heir - Ryman Frey, son of Stevron Frey. </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> In the novels, Stevron's already dead, and his son is heir.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>House Greyjoy:</strong> Their situation is currently sketchy; I initially put them in the ""Bad Off"" category, but I realized there's some things we don't know about Ironborn culture that could make difference. King Euron has no legitimate heirs, though he has plenty of bastards, but it's not clear how much that matters to the Iron Island. If he could legitimize any of his children by his salt wives, that would rescue House Greyjoy pretty nicely.</p>

<p>Theon, for his part, is no use: even if were still considered the heir to House Greyjoy, he won't be fathering any children in the near future. Asha/Yara's whereabouts on TV are unclear, but in the novel she is currently</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> married off to another House <em>and</em> held captive by Stannis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so she's no help either.</p>

<h2>The Bad</h2>

<p>Most of the Great Houses, on the other hand, have started falling apart. The list of these includes:</p>

<p><strong>House Stark:</strong> No longer technically a House at all, the Starks are dead as far as the world is concerned. There is still a chance they could recover, though. There's suspicion that Robb may have legitimized Jon Snow before he died, and we also know that Bran and Rickon are both alive. If any of those three manages to survive the rest of the series and take back Winterfell, they could rebuild their House. Of course, this is Martin, so I wouldn't put money on it.</p>

<p><strong>House Arryn:</strong> The heir to House Arryn is Robyn, who's frail and sickly and, IMO, not likely to survive very long in the real world. Petyr Baelish has managed to essentially supplant House Arryn as ruler of The Vale, as part of his plan to do whatever it is Littlefinger's really up to.</p>

<p><strong>House Lannister:</strong> This one's in complete shambles, ironically enough. The Tywin branch of this family is basically over: Jaime, by law, cannot marry (he's a Kingsguard), Tyrion's been disowned and wanted for murder, and none Tywin's grandchildren are named Lannister. Kevan's branch isn't any better: two of his children are dead and the third is Lancel, who's basically renounced any claim to nobility. (This is far more explicit in the novel: he abandons his wife and forfeits his newly-acquired land to join the penitents.)</p>

<p><strong>House Tyrell:</strong> is an interesting case: in the novels, they are doing just fine; on the show, they're on brink of extinction. </p>

<p>In the novels, three of Mace Tyrell's sons are alive and healthy, plus his uncle Moryn has several generations of children on his own. They're in no danger of dying out any time soon.</p>

<p>On TV, though, the character cutbacks mean that Mace Tyrell has only one son, Loras. While he's been released from his Kingsguard oath to Renly, it's debatable if he's ever going to produce an heir. His open homosexuality isn't really an issue: as Margaery proved with Renly, if there's a will, there's a way. The bigger problem is his betrothal to Cersei: she has every intention of getting out of that betrothal, and even if she can't, she's already proven more than willing to keep her husband childless out of spite. </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> That's assuming he's not killed by the High Sparrow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Best case, IMO, Loras gets out of his betrothal to Cersei and finds someone else willing to ""adapt"" to his lifestyle long enough to have a son (or, alternatively, fake it like Cersei did with her children).</p>

<p><strong>House Tully:</strong> Like House Stark, there is no longer technically a ""House Tully"", but they're in slightly better condition otherwise. The current heir, Edmure, is still alive and married, so there's still a chance for him to bear a son. Hoster's brother Brynden is also still alive, as far as we know.</p>

<h2>The Ugly</h2>

<p>Finally, in a bit of a class all it's own:</p>

<p><strong>House Baratheon:</strong> As far as the ""real"" Baratheons are concerned, this house is on its last legs. In the novels, Stannis is making an attempt to take back the North and, from there, Westeros from the Lannister's allies, but he's already getting desperate. In the show, </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> this branch of the family line is all dead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Legally, though, House Baratheon still rules in Westeros, as Tommen is officially Robert's son. We know that he's not, and we can probably guess that Cersei would be elated if she could find a way to use the Lannister name instead, but that's unlikely to ever happen. Being young, healthy, and married, the Baratheon line will probably continue through Tommen. After a few generations, rumors of his illegitimacy would become just a blip in their history -- assuming he's not remembered as the Baratheon that lost the Iron Throne.</p>

"93560","Can fire kill (or harm) a dragon?","<p>We all remember Daenerys's quote right after Viserys's death (Season 1 episode 6: <strong>""A Golden Crown""</strong>, and A Game of Thrones chapter <strong>Daenerys V</strong>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He was no dragon. Fire cannot kill a dragon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, are we sure that this is true? Can a dragon be killed/harmed by fire?</p>

<p>We know that a lot of dragons died during the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Doom_of_Valyria"">Doom of Valyria</a>, the cataclysm of an unspecified nature which did contain a lot of fire.
In <em>The World of Ice &amp; Fire</em>, there is a picture of dragon with fire on his back with the description <em>A dragon burning during the Doom.</em>.
It doesn't say this dragon died because of the fire, but it does prove that dragons can burn (unless we attribute this to the unreliable narrator).</p>

<p>On the other hand, dragons <em>breathe</em> fire and they seem unharmed by their own fiery breath.
Also, Daenerys hatched her dragons in pyre and that did not harm her newly-hatched dragons.</p>

<p>So was the fire during the Doom of Valyria simply much hotter than regular fire, and is that the reason it could hurt dragons?
Or did the fire during the Doom of Valyria not hurt the dragons, but did they die of other causes (e.g. debris flying around)?</p>

<p>As a side, could a dragon harm/kill another dragon with its fiery breath?
Is there any example of this, for instance during <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dance_of_the_Dragons"">the Dance of the Dragons</a>?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","93567","<p><strong>The Doom</strong><br>
It is widely believed that the Doom was a cataclysm which involved hundreds (and perhaps thousands) of volcanoes.</p>

<p>These volcanoes are speculated to have been the main cause of the downfall of these dragons.</p>

<p>See, the dragons <em>are</em> immune to fire, <strong>up to a certain point</strong>. In general, the younger they are, the less resilient they are, also their own fire is weaker in comparison to older dragons.</p>

<p><strong>The Dance</strong><br>
It is probably safe to assume that the dragons involved in The Dance of The Dragons were not affected by each others' fire. Most of them were fully grown and extremely old dragons - the likes of <strong>Caraxes</strong>, <strong>Meraxes</strong>, <strong>Vhagar</strong>, <strong>Sunfyre</strong> and <strong>Balerion the Black Dread</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>History</strong><br>
It is true that generally [Targaryen] dragons have died a violent death, this is especially true given that they were used extensively for war purposes, but there has been no known occurrence of dragons burning each other to death during any of these conflicts.<br>
Although, there are some clear examples of dragons burning each other, as exemplified in <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/93560/can-fire-kill-or-harm-a-dragon/93908#93908"">the answer privided by PrisonMonkeys</a>; killing one is a whole different story. </p>

<p>At best all we know is that their weakness is their age (the younger they are, the less resilient) and their eyes (if you were to poke one in the eye, it would probably hurt them as much as it hurts you).</p>

<p><strong>The Cannibal</strong><br>
<a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Cannibal"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Cannibal</a> was the eldest of three ""wild"" dragons living around Dragonstone, he was rumoured to have been a ""cannibal"" in that he consumed other dragons; however there is no evidence that it burned them prior to consumption.</p>

<p><strong>The Phrase</strong><br>
Logically, many people, especially Targaryens themselves attribute themselves to having dragon-like properties, which includes immunity to fire. This clearly stems from the fact that if dragons can't be burned, and Targaryens think that <em>they</em> are dragons, then they also must be immune.</p>

<p>This is where Dany's mistake comes in; she is repeatedly taught that Targaryens are dragons, etc, by her idiotic<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> brother, Viserys. This makes her think that she is immune to fire<sup><strong>2</strong></sup>; when in-fact <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/37473/21267""><strong>they are not</strong></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Where to from here?</strong><br>
So let's say you wanted to have a dragon barbecue; what you would need is a nice Mt. Doom level volcano and all you have to do is chuck the dragon in there.</p>

<hr />

<p><sup>
<strong>1.</strong> In Viserys' defence, he himself has had very little education, and has been jaded and blinded by his ambition to restore his family to the Throne.<br /><br />
<strong>2.</strong> She also mistakenly believes that she is immune to sickness, which may prove to be a grave assumption for her.

Pentos isn't much better, with indentured servants who are slaves in all but name--and the only reason they <em>aren't</em> slaves in name is because Braavos forbids it. The cities seem to be largely under the boot of powerful trading lords such as Magister Illyrio. So why are they called the <em>Free</em> Cities?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","162364","<p>Valyria needed more and more precious metals, this led to an expansion of their empire. This expansion led them across Essos to the area in which the Nine were founded. However, they were &quot;free&quot; because they were not directly ruled by the controlling power in Valyria.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the shores of Essos, the Valyrians raised cities, which we know today as the Free cities, Their origins were diverse.</p>
<p>Qohor and Norvos were founded following religious schisms. Others, such as Old Volantis and Lys, were trading colonies first and foremost, founded by wealthy merchants and nobles <strong>who purchased the right to rule themselves</strong> as clients of the Freehold rather than subjects. <strong>These cities chose their own leaders rather than receiving archons dispatched from Valyria (often on dragonback) to oversee them.</strong> It is claimed in some histories that Pentos and Lorath were of a third type—cities already extant before the Valyrians came whose <strong>rulers paid homage to Valyria and thus retained their right to native rule.</strong> In these cities, what influx of Valyrian blood there was came from migrants from the Freehold, or political marriages used to better bind these cities to Valyria. Yet most of the histories that recount this take as their source Gessio Haratis's Before the Dragons. Haratis was himself from Pentos, and at the time, Volantis was threatening to restore the Valyrian empire under its control, so the notion of an independent Pentos with origins distinct from Valyria was a most politic convenience.</p>
<p>However, it is clear that Braavos is unique among all the Free Cities, as it was founded not by the will of the Freehold, nor by its citizens, but instead by its slaves.</p>

<p><strong>The distinction that sets the Nine apart is not their size but their origins.</strong> At their height before the Doom, other cities, such as Mantarys, Volon Therys, Oros, Tyria, Draconys, Elyria, Mhysa Faer, Rhyos, and Aquos Dhaen were grand and glorious and rich, yet for all their pride and power, none ever ruled itself. They were governed by men and women sent out from Valyria to govern in the name of the Freehold.</p>
<p>Such was never true of Volantis and the rest of the Nine. <strong>Though born of Valyria, each was independent of its mother from birth.</strong> All but Braavos were dutiful daughters, neither making war upon Valyria nor defying the dragon lords in any matter of significance; they remained willing allies and trading partners of their mother and looked to the Lands of the Long Summer for leadership in times of crisis. In lesser matters, however, the Nine Free Cities went their own ways, under the rule of their own priests and princes and archons and triarchs.</p>

<p><strong>Is there evidence in the books to support the theory that greyscale is connected to The Others?</strong></p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","93760","<p>According to the novels, greyscale is not a simple disease, but it's not tied to The Others. Rather, it's tied to an historical figure known as Garin the Great, a Rhoynish prince who lived about 1,000 years ago.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>NOTE: <em>Minor</em> spoilers for <em>A Dance with Dragons</em> -- we find all of this out in that novel, but I'm not including any real plot points.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>During the so-called Second Spice War, a small group of Valyrian lords allied with Volantis to attack the Rhoynar. Prince Garin led the resistance, and initially was winning, until Valyria decided to throw all-in and send an army of dragons. The Valyrian army crush the Rhoynar and captured Garin.</p>

<p>According to legend, the captive Garin called out to the goddess of the river, Mother Rhoyne, and she made the rivers rise up out of their banks into a massive fog, and when the fog had lifted, the Valyrians were all dead.</p>

<p>The area of the river where this supposedly happens&mdash;The Sorrows&mdash;is still considered cursed, and the greyscale sufferers still live there. The same legend claims that Garin is actually still alive, and that he is the Shrouded Lord that rules the Sorrows. It also claims that ""Garin's Curse"", which killed the Valyrians, was actually greyscale, brought on by Mother Rhoyne.</p>

<p>The idea that it started with Garin is reinforced a bit by another legend about the Shrouded Lord: that he was originally a statue, come to life by the kiss of a strange woman. If Garin was the first person afflicted with greyscale, he would definitely have looked like a statue come to life to people that had never seen it before.</p>

<p>Of course, these are all just legends, and even Garin's legend has a touch of Other in it (specifically, the woman who brought the Shrouded Lord to life was ""grey"" with ""lips as cold as ice"". ) The real origins of greyscale have never been explored, and records of it are sketchy, so it's not clear how recently the disease appeared, or if Garin could really have been the origins.</p>

<li>Greyscale thrives in <em>damp</em> climates, like the rivers.</li>
<li>I have no idea where reddit came up with the ""fact"" that greyscale is tied to the Grey Waste; it's tied to the River Rhoyne and The Sorrows</li>

Of course, it's known that Jaime and Cersei had sex, but I can't remember anything in the books or show that proves that Robert was not the father, other than the hair colour of Cersei's children compared to his baseborn children.</p>

<p>Given that paternity tests, presumably, aren't a thing in the world of GoT, if Cersei is found guilty by the faith that she has laid with her brother, I'm still really not sure how it would remove Tommen from the throne. Sure, you can't guarantee he's the legitimate heir but you can't disprove it either.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","93881","<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>:That depends on who's the one looking for evidence. There's no doubt for us, the reader, that the three children are Jaime's. For the people within the universe of the show, things are murkier. For the High Sparrow's part, the best he can do is heresay and circumstantial evidence, though it would likely be enough to find her guilty anyway.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Outside Perspective</h2>

<p><em>We</em>, the readers/viewers, know for sure that the children are Jaime's, because Cersei admitted to Ned Stark that she made sure of it. She only ever permitted Robert to impregnate her one time, and that child died. Thereafter, she took measures to ensure that it never happened again, mostly involving never sleeping with him if she could help it.</p>

<p>Cersei would certainly know whether or not the children could have been conceived by Robert just based on her having slept with him soon before she got pregnant. So, we can safely take her word for it when she says this.</p>

<p>Beyond that, we've seen more than enough points of view from Cersei and/or Jaime to know that they both genuinely believe the children to be theirs, and again, if anyone would know, it would be them.</p>

<h2>Those In-The-Know</h2>

<p>Similarly, there's a select group of people within the novels that know the truth for certain, again because Cersei or Jaime told them. I go into details in the answer to <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/59466/who-knows-the-real-parentage-of-cerseis-children"">this question</a> but the list is pretty short; the only ones left alive, to my knowledge, are  Cersei, Jaime, and Tyrion. Both Ned and Catelyn Stark also knew the truth before their deaths, and in the TV Show, Tywin and Myrcella also finds out. </p>

<p>There are also people who have very strong suspicions, like Tywin (in the novels) and Kevan Lannister, and I'm also put money on people like Varys and Littlefinger having good sources. Many of these people have made off-hand remarks about Jaime being the father, to Cersei's face, and not been corrected, so their suspicions were effectively confirmed. </p>

<h2>Everyone Else</h2>

<p>As far as the general public goes, the only real evidence they have is the same evidence that led Jon Arryn and Ned Stark to discover the truth in the first place: basic genetics. Specifically, the ""look"" of the Baratheon line is apparently made up of several very dominant traits, primarily the dark hair color.</p>

<p>There is a book detailing the lineage of all of the Great Houses back many generations; prompted by an off-hand remark by Sansa, Ned digs around in this book and learns that <em>every single</em> Baratheon child in recorded history has had dark hair; this includes all of Robert's bastard children, but <em>not his children by Cersei</em>. Instead, those children have the golden hair common to the Lannister children, like Cersei and Jaime.</p>

<p>These days, we know enough about genetics to know that this <em>could</em> still be possible: the children could have inherited a recessive gene from Robert that he doesn't outwardly display. But even then it would be pretty persuasive: generation after generation of dark-haired children, and suddenly your fair-haired wife with the fair-haired brother gives birth the three straight fair-haired kids? </p>

<p>In the world of ASoIaF, this kind of evidence would be almost irrefutable.</p>

"24883","What were the memorable scenes in ""A Storm of Swords"" that motivated Benioff to make the adaptation?","<p>Just to be clear, this is not a ""make a list for me"" question, it is about what motivated Benioff to get on board with the <em>Game of Thrones</em>. </p>

<p>In the Wikipedia article for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_%28season_3%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Game of Thrones</em>, season 3</a>, you can read the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to Benioff, the third season will contain a particularly
  memorable scene from A Storm of Swords, the prospect of filming which
  was part of their motivation to adapt the novels for television in the
  first place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've also seen elsewhere that there are in fact two scenes. Does anyone know which scene or scenes they refer to that provided such a major influence in getting the books made into a show? The only thing that springs to mind is (spoiler ASOS)</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> The Red Wedding. Or possibly the assault on the Wall by Mance Rayder.</p>
</blockquote>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","24884","<p>The scene Benioff was talking about is almost certainly </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>The Red Wedding</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was recently revealed that there is a <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/GoT/News/Entry/Its_a_Nice_Day_For_A/"">casting call</a> for cellists ""ideally men with medieval or period faces (i.e. long hair and beards)"", as well as ""LEG ONLY, MALE AMPUTEES"" who are ""OK and comfortable with filming a scene within the context of a battle where your leg has been injured. Prosthetic makeup will be applied as though your leg has newly been severed.""</p>

<p>The Cellists make it almost certainly the aforementioned event, as music was a key part (<em>The Rains of Castamere</em>, anyone?).</p>

<p>The scene itself is one of the most heart wrenching and emotionally disturbing in the entire series, and George R.R. Martin himself has stated that the scene is <a href=""http://www.empireonline.com/interviews/interview.asp?IID=1496"">the most difficult he has ever written</a>.</p>

<p>On a personal note:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> The willingness of Martin to kill off of major characters has become one of the stand-out aspects of his writing, and the shock of realizing what has happened the first time I read it really changed my perspective on the whole series, even more so than the death of Ned Stark.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regarding the full context of the <a href=""http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/03/30/game-of-thrones-showrunners-season-2/2/"">interview with Benioff</a> referenced in the question:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> The Red Wedding seems particularly suited towards an incredibly momentous and dramatic televised scene, largely due to the tension of the wedding leading up to it, and the fact that the combat noises are drowned out by loud music.  I can easily envision bloody fight scenes interspaced with dramatic closeups of musicians furiously playing as loudly as they can, and this ties in almost exactly with the casting call descriptions cited above.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regarding the second scene mentioned, I can only speculate.  However, in addition to the other scene you mentioned in your question (which does seem a very likely candidate), I think these are just as likely, if not more:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Daenerys taking command of the army of Unsullied and turning them upon their Astaporian masters, the duel of Oberyn Martel vs. Ser Gregor Clagane, the escape of Tyrion, or possibly even the return of Catelyn Stark.</p>

"24948","Confusing movements of Lannister Armies under Jaime and Tywin?","<p>I'm currently reading A Game of Thrones for the first time and I have gotten to the point where Robb is explaining his plan at Moat Cailin. This is a highly geeky question, so I apologize in advance!</p>

<p>The problem is that I can't make sense of what Robb claims the Lannisters have been up to (p582). According to him:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Less than a fortnight past, they fought a battle in the hills below the Golden Tooth,” Robb said.</p>
  
  <p>“Uncle Edmure had sent Lord Vance and Lord Piper to hold the pass, but the Kingslayer  descended on them and put them to flight. Lord Vance was slain. The last word we had was that Lord Piper was falling back to join your brother and his other  bannermen at Riverrun, with Jaime Lannister on his heels. That’s not the worst of it, though. All the time they were battling in the pass, <strong>Lord Tywin was bringing a second Lannister army around from the south.</strong> It’s said to be even larger than Jaime’s host. </p>
  
  <p>“Father must have known that, because he sent out some men to oppose them, under the king’s own banner. He gave the command to some southron lordling, Lord Erik or Derik or something like that, but Ser Raymun Darry rode with him, and the letter said there were other knights as well, and a force of Father’s own guardsmen. Only it was a trap. <strong>Lord Derik had no sooner crossed the Red Fork than the Lannisters fell upon him, the king’s banner be damned, and Gregor Clegane took them in the rear as they tried to pull back cross the Mummer’s Ford.</strong> This Lord Derik and a few others may have escaped, no one is certain, but Ser Raymun was killed, and most of our men from Winterfell. Lord Tywin has closed off the kingsroad, it’s said, and now he’s marching <strong>north toward Harrenhal</strong>, burning as he goes.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can't make any sense of where these armies are supposed to be coming from, or where are they going?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9xEdP.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Jaime apparently marched out of Casterly Rock, taking Vance and Piper on at Golden Tooth and forcing them to retreat towards Riverrun. That makes sense. </p>

<p>But how did the men Eddard sent from King's Landing (Lord Beric and company) to take on Tywin's army, get to the Red Fork before they were attacked? And how did Tywin's force then start heading ""north"" toward Harrenhal, when they were already north of it (at the Ruby Ford)?</p>

<p>Can anyone explain? I've probably misunderstood something. Thanks!</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><warfare><geography>","24951","<p>I think you have mixed the armies up. Lord Beric Dondarrion was not sent to oppose the Lannister forces, he was sent out to deal with Gregor Clegane, who was <em>assumed</em> to be acting on Lord Tywin's orders, though in truth no one had any proof of that. Ned Stark saw this as an attempt by Tywin to goad the Riverlords into starting the war, by taking their revenge on the westerners. I do not believe that Tywin and Gregor Clegane ever fought together, and that Dondarrion's party was ambushed by Clegane and some other force of Lannister men.</p>

<p>I believe Tywin made his way around south, like the first quote says, to close the Kingsroad north of King's Landing, and nothing else (at this point). It was, I believe, his intention to allow Clegane to roam free and not be directly associated with his atrocities.</p>

<p>So in essence: The armies are all coming from the West, Lord Tywin's and his bannermen's domains, and they are going out into the Riverlands, Tywin from the south and Jaime from the west. Clegane and Ser Amory Lorch were already there, killing and burning. Later on it is mentioned that Ser Stafford Lannister, an uncle of Jaime's, is killed with a new host of recruits at the battle of Oxcross, an army coming also from the westerlands going to the riverlands.</p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","24971","<p>I finally found an answer from Martin himself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>BHW</strong>: Why is the wall so tall?</p>
  
  <p><strong>Martin</strong>: To keep out bad things.</p>
  
  <p>Hadrian's Wall was an inspiration. In fantasy, everything is bigger. A
  friend of mine, Lisa Tuttle (we wrote Windhaven together), had just
  moved to Scotland and was giving me a tour. We were driving in her car
  and got to Hadrian's Wall at the end of the day. The tour buses were
  leaving. We walked along the top of the wall just as the sun was going
  down. It was the fall. I stood there and looked out over the hills of
  Scotland and wondered what it would be like to be a Roman centurion
  from Italy , Greece , or even Africa , covered in furs and not knowing
  what would be coming out of the north at you. I wanted to capture that
  feeling.</p>
  
  <p>Hadrian's Wall is impressive, but it's not really tall. A good ladder
  would be all you need to scramble right on over it. When you're doing
  fantasy, it has to be bigger than in real life. The castles are
  grander. Fantasy is painted in larger scale and brighter colors.</p>

"233036","Is Arya Stark the heir to House Whent?","<p><a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/213339/89104"">This says</a> that <a href=""https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/House_Whent"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">House Whent</a> maybe went extinct. The Whent family was wiped out enough during the War of the Five Kings for their lands to be given away to Janos Slynt as a gift for his help in betraying Ned Stark.</p>
<p>Known members of the house are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lord Walter Whent and Lady Shella Whent, who died without heirs.</li>
<li>Oswell Whent, who died during Robert's Rebellion. He was Walter Whent's younger brother.</li>
<li>Lasy Minisa Whent, who died during the birth of Edmure Tully. Minisa Whent married Hoster Tully and gave birth to three children: Catelyn, Lysa, and Edmure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Catelyn is the oldest, so she might have the best claim to the Whent holdings. She married Lord Eddard Stark and bore five children. Her surviving children are Sansa Stark, Bran Stark, and Arya Stark. Assuming that Sansa Stark does not claim the Whent family holdings because she is Queen of the North, and that Bran Stark does not claim the Whent family holdings because he is King of the Six Kingdoms, then the next claimant would be Arya Stark.</p>
<p>There are reasons why Arya might have no claim.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike the North which allows a woman to inherit a noble title (such as Lady Alys Karstark or Lady Lyanna Mormont), the nobles of the Riverlands might only pass title through a male line.</li>
<li>There might be other survivors of House Whent.</li>
<li>Edmure Tully or Robyn Arryn might try to press their claim to the Whent lands.</li>
<li>Arya's two older siblings might claim title ahead of her. (Sansa Stark is Queen of the North, but that is now a foreign land, but this is like how <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_the_Conqueror"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">William the Conqueror</a> claimed the titles of both King of England and Duke of Normandy at the same time. And if a person can claim multiple titles in Westeros, then Bran Stark could also claim to be King of the Six Kingdoms and Lord of Whent.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the answers to these three questions are all &quot;no&quot;, then it seems Arya Stark is the next Lady Whent.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there anything in the books that says noble titles in the Riverlands can only be inherited by men?</li>
<li>Are there other survivors of the Whent family? (Including legitimized children born out of wedlock.)</li>
<li>Are there rules forbidding a person from claiming multiple noble titles?</li>
</ul>
<p>Although I mention events from the last episode of the TV series, which are not yet mentioned in the books, I am looking for answers to my questions from the books first, then other canon sources, and lastly the TV series.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","233063","<p>I am going to take your questions one by one...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there anything in the books that says noble titles in the Riverlands can only be inherited by men?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is nothing that says a woman <em>can't</em> inherit lands/titles. It is just very rare. Almost all houses are going to look to the <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/37862/comprehensive-rules-for-game-of-thrones-lines-of-succession"">male line first.</a> Walter Whent did have four sons, but they all perished with unknown status if they had any children. The same goes for his only daughter. Walter's brother Oswell was a member of the Kings Guard and also slain at the Tower of Joy. So. Walter's line is broken once Shelia is killed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are there other survivors of the Whent family? (Including legitimized children born out of wedlock.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only other known members of House Whent are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Minisa_Tully"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Minisa Whent</a>, deceased wife of Lord Hoster Tully, and mother to Catelyn, Lysa and Edmure Tully.</li>
<li><a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Sarya_Whent"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sarya Whent</a>, fifth wife of Lord Walder Frey. Deceased with no progeny.</li>
<li><a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Wynafrei_Whent"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wynafrei Whent</a>, married to the ninth son of Lord Walder Frey, Ser Danwell. She has no progeny yet, only many stillbirths and miscarriages so far.</li>
</ul>
<p>So without any other known members, all the direct line deceased or having no progeny, we would refer back to the first question and find the nearest male relative, Edmure Tully.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are there rules forbidding a person from claiming multiple noble titles?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not at all, in fact, <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/120262/what-titles-does-littlefinger-currently-hold"">Petyr Baelish holds many titles</a> in the books, which I do believe holds true through the show. With Littefinger's fate in the show, Lord Paramount of the Trident would pass back to Edmure Tully.</p>
<p>To summarize...</p>
<p>Being male, a direct Whent descendant, and being their liege lord, <strong>Edmure Tully would be the one to decide who would inherit House Whent's lands.</strong> Since the House is extinct he could effectively give to whomever he pleases (like how Bronn was set to inherit Highgarden in the show).</p>
<p>This would not likely be Arya, she is of the North, not the Riverlands. Edmure will have other vassals to appease or even keep the lands with the Tully's since their line was also devastated by the wars.</p>

"94667","Where are the other Baelishes, if any?","<p>I had a random thought : Does Petyr Baelish still have any relatives? What happened to his parents? Any siblings? Any children, legitimate or illegitimate?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>So Littlefinger's <strong>great-grandfather</strong> was Braavosi, but his <strong>grandfather</strong> was a Westerosi hedge knight.</p>
<p>And on the next page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Well, you can scarcely be my true-born daughter. I've never taken a wife, that's well known. What should you be called?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I ... I could call myself after my mother ...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Catelyn? A bit too obvious ... but after <em>my</em> mother, that would serve. Alayne. Do you like it?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So his <strong>mother</strong> was named Alayne, and he has <strong>no legitimate children</strong>. As for illegitimate children, there is speculation that <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1vfcvf/spoilers_all_could_robert_arryn_be_littlefingers/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Robert/Robin Arryn</a> may really be Littlefinger's bastard son and even that <a href=""http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/84685-sansa-is-really-littlefingers-daughter/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Sansa Stark</a> may really be his bastard daughter, but no confirmation either way.</p>
<p>Quoting from an <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/US_Signing_Tour_Half_Moon_Bay_CA/"" rel=""noreferrer"">interview with GRRM</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In response to the why was LF fostered at Riverrun when he was a insignificant lord question: GRRM said that Petyr's father and Hoster met up during the War of the Ninepenny Kings and became friends. Apparently that was a time when a lot of people from all over the realm forged friendships. LF's dad later &quot;cashed in&quot; on the friendship to get LF fostered at Riverrun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So his <strong>father</strong> was sufficiently high in society to be considered a friend by Lord Tully.</p>

"94751","Does Trial by Combat actually work?","<p>We've seen several instances of Trial by Combat in both the <em>Game of Thrones</em> TV series and the <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> novels. Trial by Combat is said to allow the gods themselves to determine the innocence of the accused party by having them win the fight if they are innocent and lose the fight if they are guilty.</p>

  <p> In the Trial by Combat that sees Lord Beric Dondarrion battle Ser Sandor Clegane AKA The Hound, Lord Dondarrion puts his defeat down to the intervention of the Lord of Light, talking about a whip of fire that shattered his sword.</p>

<p>Is Trial by Combat only ever determined by the abilities of the combatants, rather than the gods as people believe?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","94761","<p>Trial by combat ""works"" in the sense that it quickly determines guilt, as opposed to a long trial that is often rigged (EG: both of Tyrion's trials).

<p><a href=""http://www.atlredline.com/trial-by-combat-it-was-real-and-spectacular-1575163115"">This article</a> explains some of the historical context and why historically it was a poor choice to determine the innocence of an accused party:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most popular, yet least used and least defensible trial by battle option was in the criminal context. That's how it's portrayed on Game of Thrones. A man stands accused of something, a show trial is convened, the man has the option to fight to the truth in the absence of a formal trial.</p>
  
  <p>You can see why this wasn't the preferred method of criminal justice, even in medieval England. Why would a king go through the trouble of setting up a show trial only to have it thwarted by the vagaries of hand to hand combat? We're talking about kings here, divine-right monarchs. Trial by combat doesn't put the decision in the hands of God, the king IS God. Nobody was getting out of a state criminal proceeding by hiring a good fighter.</p>
  
  <p>However, in their book History of Criminal Justice, Mark Jones and Peter Johnstone explain that trial by battle was used when the accuser and criminal defendant were both private parties. Again, this looks more like the land disputes we talked about earlier. ""He killed my friend."" ""No I didn't."" ""LIAR [draws sword].""</p>

<p>How much are other, non-Northern places (such as Kings Landing, Dorne, and Essos, which have been depicted as warmer) affected by Winter? Do they face the same issues that the North faces (risks of freezing to death or starvation), or do they not have to worry about it as much as the Starks?</p>

<p>Much of this during the <strong>War of the Five Kings.</strong></p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><character-motivation>","163620","<p><strong>Would the war still have occurred?</strong> </p>

<p>I think that it is highly likely that the end result would be similar, it might just happen with different players. </p>

<p>Remember who started this whole wheel in motion... Petyr ""Chaos is a Ladder"" Baelish! Considering how long he has been planning this plot it is likely that he is willing to change tactics and find the best result amid the chaos.</p>

<p>Also remember that Cersei is an active player in this game as well. She has been looking for a way to knock off good ol' Bobby B. The true start of the War is the suggested illegitimacy of Robert's children. Littlefinger would surely keep pushing this agenda to both Stannis and Renly once Robert is dead. Stannis also knew of the bastards as he was helping Jon Arryn investigate. While he fled to Dragonstone after Arryn's death, he was most likely trying to rally some support before pressing his claim. </p>

<p>No doubt Varys would want something similar to this out come as well. To get a Targaryen back on the throne the Seven Kingdoms need to be in a weakened state since the ""invading"" Targaryen army would have a much smaller, foreign army and no dragons this time around. The Lannisters are no easy foe as they control much of the kingdom's wealth. </p>

<p><strong>Overall it was not a matter of IF it was a matter of WHEN</strong>. All the masterminds (Petyr Baelish, Varys, and Cersei) seem to be willing to bide their time and adjust to external events accordingly. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Would Robb have been crowned King in the North?</strong></p>

<p>This is not as likely. If the Starks were brought into the new scenario (as I outlined above) Ned would have raised his banners for Stannis. </p>

<p>Ned refused Renly's offer while still in King's Landing because Stannis ""has the right"". But this is why Robb was proclaimed as King in the North in the first place, as basically since there was no clear heir to throne, why should they have one at all.  The North was seeking justice/vengeance for the Lannisters beheading their liege lord. With Ned still alive, they are fighting to restore proper law with Stannis. Ned would not have allowed his bannermen to declare him King. </p>

<p>If Ned was killed in battle there would be no cause for vengeance from the North. Robb would carry on the good fight in the name of Stannis and either that side is victorious or is defeated.</p>

<p>But why was their plan so complicated?
Why couldn't Lady Olenna just bring a strangler crystal with her to the wedding (as suggested in <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/93365/15363"">this answer</a>)?</p>

<p>Then they wouldn't depend on Ser Dontos and Sansa who could unknowingly have done something to prevent the success of the plan.</p>

<p>The only reason that I could think of, is Littlefinger and Lady Olenna plan for Sansa (and Tyrion as her husband with her) to take the blame for Joffrey's death.</p>

<p>They put the crystals on her person, so that upon examination it would clearly show that Sansa had the murder weapon on her. But Littlefinger had a plan he did not tell Lady Olenna, namely rescuing Sansa during the chaos ensuing the murder (and thereby leaving Tyrion behind as the only accused).</p>

<p>Is there anything confirming or debunking this theory?
If my theory doesn't hold up, is there another explanation for why the plan was so needlessly complicated?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","94968","<p>It is complicated because there a lot of moving parts to the plan and competing agendas. </p>

<p>I think you mostly have it right, except the part about Olenna agreeing that Sansa takes the blame. It may be more subtle than that.</p>

<p>See below:</p>

<hr>

<p>Ostensibly, Littlefinger's main goal is to Assassinate Joffrey, per his agreement with Olenna.</p>

<p>But Littlefinger also knows this will give him his one opportunity to free Sansa, which most likely is his main goal. He won't get another opportunity as the Lannisters would never agree to give her up, and she is a perfect scapegoat with no allies at court and with the Starks as enemies of the crown. Meaning he cannot assume he will be able to stage an escape attempt after the assassination.</p>

<p>There will only be a short time window for her to escape, while everyone is distracted by the assassination. </p>

<p>Littlefinger needs someone Sansa trusts (Ser Dontos) to ensure his plan is successful. He can watch for the precise moment to escape with her, he has detailed knowledge of where to take her, and she will agree to go.</p>

<hr>

<p>On the other hand, Lady Olenna is no fool and most likely only agreed to betroth Margery to Joffrey after Littlefinger guaranteed Joffrey could be replaced with a more suitable husband. She may have wanted to directly take part in the assassination to guarantee its success.</p>

<p>But, she would not want to carry the poison on herself because:</p>

<ul>
<li>It might be found if guests were stopped and searched</li>
<li>The hall is crowded and someone might notice if she drops/discards it</li>
<li>Littlefinger could double-cross her (EG: a guest could accuse her, and then the Lannisters find the poison on her)</li>
</ul>

<p>This plays into Littlefinger's plans as Sansa is the perfect candidate to carry the poison (for both Littlefinger and Olenna), and will most likely be happy to have done so when she finds out about it later</p>

<p>Olenna probably did not originally want Sansa to take the blame, as she wanted her to marry a Tyrell so the Tyrells could claim the north.</p>

<p>But Olenna may have felt it an acceptable risk for Sansa to carry the poison if someone else (Tyrion) was planned to take the blame. If Sansa is found out, Olenna still achieves her primary goal of assassinating Joffrey. She just loses an opportunity to also get Sansa. And of course she would not have cared about Sansa at all once Tyrion married her.</p>

<p>However, I have not read the books. Is their relationship built on (slowly-built) respect for one another, or is there anything else happening?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","95286","<p>Mutual respect slowly builds after Jaime suffers his disfigurement. Suddenly he is no longer the cock on the walk, able to do what he wants to whomever he wants. He is no longer the shining golden perfection. Because he is now imperfect in his own eyes. And Brienne is also imperfect, both being a woman knight and described as highly unattractive. Because he can see them both as disfigured, he can now see them as something approaching equals. It is a measure of his respect for her that he gives her his sword.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, Jaime started as a two dimensional character but developed into a far more complex, three-dimensional character. He isn't entirely a bad guy, especially once he learns imperfection.</p>

<p>I thought the show emphasized more of a sexual attraction between them than was present in the books. There was some in the books, but I thought that was more due to Jaime coming to care about Brienne (because he now respects her) and being that she is perhaps the second woman in his life that he's ever really cared about, even he isn't sure about his own feelings.</p>

<p>Consider, he loves his sister and knows their love is forbidden. He cares about Brienne, and in his eyes (because of her imperfections) their care and respect for one another would be forbidden. With his sister, he just goes and consummates. He doesn't with Brienne, but he may well feel that he should, because <em>that's what he thinks he is supposed to do with women he cares about and respects</em>. I think that even Jaime isn't sure about his own feelings; he has some kind of emotions and he isn't entirely sure how to deal with them.</p>

The Rhoynar settled in Dorne when they fled Essos hundreds of years before Aegon's Landing. I know he meant to conquer Dorne, so I understand he calling himself their king before actually conquering them, but did he style himself king of the Rhoynar after he made peace with Dorne?

  <p>all of the Targaryen kings starting with Aegon I himself styled themselves as ""King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men"" and ""Lord of the Seven Kingdoms"" - despite the fact that Dorne remained independent. Aegon I had declared himself king of all of Westeros just before his army even landed on the continent, Dorne included. While Dorne had been able to resist his armies and dragons through guerrilla warfare, Aegon himself never acknowledged that this was a permanent state of affairs. Aegon and all of his heirs considered themselves the de jure kings of the Rhoynar and of Dorne, even if they had no de facto control over it (comparable to how medieval English kings would at times hold titles of lordship over ""Wales"", ""Ireland"", and ""France"", despite not controlling all or even most of these territories). </p>

Ok, fine, but I have some problems with this. First: why the Watch? Given that Sam was a bookworm, if would've made much more sense to send him to the Citadel; this would also achieve the same purpose since Maesters forgo any claims and titles. Second, given that Sam had ""chosen"" to take the black out of free will (i.e., he wasn't a criminal), couldn't he just say he changed his mind after arriving on the Wall and so leave (before taking his vows, of course)?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","27090","<p>You may have missed that Sam had already explored the option of becoming a maester with his father. The result was that Lord Tarly said something to the effect of:</p>

<p>...And chained him in the dungeon. Lord Tarly is a hard man, and has been trying many different things to make his son into what he wanted him to be. Allowing him to become maester would not be something he wanted.</p>

<p>As Sam says in AFFC/ADWD, the life of a maester is servitude, and no son of Lord Randyll Tarly could humiliate himself in that way. In the Night's Watch, Lord Tarly figures that Sam might finally become the hardened man he always wanted him to be. Although I don't think he really cares, he just wanted him gone, so his younger son Dickon could be his heir.</p>

<p>Finally, of course, Sam cannot exactly leave the watch. As long as he is alive and a free agent, he threatens Dickon's inheritance, so Lord Tarly would probably have him killed. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every day since her escape from the Red Keep, Arya had visited each of the seven city gates in turn. The Dragon Gate, the Lion Gate, and the Old Gate were closed and barred. The Mud Gate and the Gate of the Gods were open, but only to those who wanted to enter the city; the guards let no one out. Those who were allowed to leave left by the King’s Gate or the Iron Gate, but Lannister men-at-arms in crimson cloaks and lion-crested helms manned the guard posts there. Spying down from the roof of an inn by the King’s Gate, Arya saw them searching wagons and carriages, forcing riders to open their saddlebags, and questioning everyone who tried to pass on foot.</p>

<p>But just a page or two later, she's walking along the River, watching people in the Fishmarket...</p>

  <p>The wharfs were oddly quiet when Arya got there. She spied another pair of Gold Cloaks, walking side by side through the fish market, but they never so much as looked at her.

<p>I just bought the official maps as part of The Lands of Ice and Fire, and I just don't see how this is possible?</p>

<p>Can anyone explain this so it makes sense?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/4cUm9.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","184968","<p>It appears as if George R. R. Martin changed his mind for the location of the Mud Gate after writing A Game of Thrones. This is backed up as the paragraph before the second quote in the OP says that the riverfront is on the way to the Mud Gate not after it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A gull wheeled overhead as she made her way down the hill toward Flea Bottom. Arya glanced at it thoughtfully, but it was well beyond the reach of her stick. It made her think of the sea. Maybe that was the way out. Old Nan used to tell stories of boys who stowed away on trading galleys and sailed off into all kinds of adventures. Maybe Arya could do that too. <strong>She decided to visit the riverfront. It was on the way to the Mud Gate anyway</strong>, and she hadn't checked that one today.<br />
The wharfs were oddly quiet when Arya got there. ...<br />

<p>I have also tweeted Elio and Linda, the co-authors of The World of Ice and Fire, and they have replied with essentially the same reasoning as me above. (I assume they got their information from the same text as I have and not from anything extra that they have access to).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>@CarrotLethal</strong>: <em>Hello! In AGoT how does Arya get through the Mud Gate? It was only open to those entering the city but Arya manages to get through it to the wharfs and fish market. Any ideas? Thanks!</em></p>
<p><strong>@westerosorg</strong>: GRRM's conception of the Mud Gate changed between AGoT and ACoK is, I think, the answer. In AGoT, Arya goes to the riverfront because &quot;its on the way&quot; to the Mud Gate, whereas with ACoK the Mud Gate is &quot;on the way&quot; to the riverfront.</p>

<p>Elio and Linda's extended point is made clear in A Clash of Kings when the text describes the riverfront as being on the outside of the Mud Gate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beyond the castle, King's Landing rose on its hills behind the encircling walls. <strong>The riverfront was a blackened desolation; the Lannisters had burned everything and pulled back within the Mud Gate.</strong> The charred spars of sunken hulks sat in the shallows, forbidding access to the long stone quays.

<p>The map in ACoK now matches what is in The Lands of Ice and Fire for the location of the Mud Gate to the riverfront. (Note that only the maps in The Lands of Ice and Fire are canon but in this case they match and it shows George's thought process changing between the books.)</p>

"27187","What is the reason/significance of a lion as Lannister house sigil?","<p>I'm halfway through the first half of <em>A Storm of Swords</em>, and so far appearances or references to every animal/symbol of every house sigil have been made, with exception to the lion of Lannister.</p>

<p>I mean, we've seen <strong>direwolves</strong> (Stark), <strong>stags</strong> (Baratheon), <strong>bears</strong> (Mormont), <strong>dragons</strong> (Targaryen), <strong>trouts</strong> (Tully) and eagles (although Arryn's sigil is a <strong>falcon</strong>, it is close enough and most likely exists). We know that there are sigils such as the Frey's <strong>Twins</strong>  or the Martell's <strong>Sun and Spear</strong> (Sunspear) that are a reference to their ""keep's"" name or location. Furthermore, in page 108 of ASOS's first part, Jorah Mormont tells Daenerys that ""(...)dragons(...) grew so huge that they could pluck giant <strong>krakens</strong> from the seas."", making reference to the Greyjoy's sigil animal, in a way that is not metaphorical. The Tyrell's sigil is a <strong>flower</strong>, which is explained by their natural lands, fertile and flowery. Similar to the case of House Arryn's sigil is House Florent's (we've seen wolves but not <strong>foxes</strong>, but they most likely exist in Westeros South, since the geographical location and climate would allow them to).</p>

<p>This means that, excluding the <strong>lion</strong> of Lannister, every house sigil (that I am aware of so far) as been referenced in conditions other than metaphors (like the lion defeating the wolf, referring to this or that battle between Lannister and Stark, etc.), and/or can have its meaning traced back to its House's geographical location.</p>

<p>As far as I have read, no lion other than a metaphorical one (used in confrontations with other houses, reflecting the characteristics (fierce, beautiful, etc.) of some Lannister House member, etc.) or the one present in the Lannister House sigil has been spotted or referenced in the books. Judging from the biomes in Westeros, I'd say that lions are bound to be indigenous to some location further South (or perhaps they come from Essos). This begs the question: <strong>Do lions exists in Westeros or in the world of ASOIAF? If so, why is it House Lannister's sigil? Shouldn't they have picked some animal natural to their geographical region or something like that?</strong></p>

<p>If this question is simply something that is answered by reading the rest of the series just tell me so, and sorry for the long question.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","27207","<p>In A Clash of Kings, Sandor Clegane tells Sansa the story of how his house came to be, and the story behind his sigil.</p>

<p>His father was a kennel master in service to a Lannister lord, as I recall Tyrion's grandfather, Lord Tywin's father. One day when they were out hunting, the lord came under attack from a lion, but the kennel master set his dogs on the lion and saved the lord. Three of the dogs died, and the grateful lord bestowed lands and title on his kennel master. Those three dogs were then put on the Clegane arms, in memory of their heroism.</p>

<p>So at least in that story, it would seem there are lions in the area of Casterly Rock.</p>

<p>EDIT: Found the reference:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first knight of House Clegane was kennelmaster at Casterly Rock until he saved Lord Tytos Lannister from a lioness and lost a leg and three dogs in the effort. As a reward, Lord Tytos gave him lands and a towerhouse and took his son as his squire. The three dogs on the Clegane sigil represent those that died saving Lord Tytos.</p>

<p>Quoted from the wiki at westeros.org: <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Clegane"">House Clegane</a></p>

<p>EDIT 2: Exact quote from A Clash of Kings, page 262:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I like dogs better than knights. My father's father was kennelmaster at the Rock. One autumn year, Lord Tytos came between a lioness and her prey. Lioness didn't give a shit that she was Lannister's own sigil. Bitch tore into my lord's horse and would have done for my lord too, but my grandfather came up with the hounds. Three of his dogs died running her off. My grandfather lost a leg, so Lannister paid him for it with lands and a towerhouse, and took his son to squire. The three dogs on our banner are the three that died, in the yellow of autumn grass. A hound will die for you, but never lie to you. And he'll look you straight in the face.""</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A few days past, he had taken Ned aside to show him an exquisite rose

  Now there's a son any man would be proud to own to. Last tourney, he

  look on Cersei's face. I laughed till my sides hurt. Renly says he has
  this sister, a maid of fourteen, lovely as a dawn …""<br><sub><strong><em>AGOT - Eddard VII</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Varys also knew about it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Knight of Flowers writes Highgarden, urging his lord father to
  send his sister to court. The girl is a maid of fourteen, sweet and
  beautiful and tractable, and Lord Renly and Ser Loras intend that
  Robert should bed her, wed her, and make a new queen.<br><sub><strong><em>AGOT - Arya III</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then Stannis openly said it out loud:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""We both know your wedding was a mummer's farce. <strong>A year ago you were
  scheming to make the girl one of Robert's whores.</strong>""</p>
  
  <p>""<strong>A year ago I was scheming to make the girl Robert's queen</strong>,"" Renly

  <p>""In your bed she's like to die that way.""<br><sub><strong><em>ACOK- Catelyn III</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now with the core premise established, the question is, how did Renly expect that to work out?</p>

<p>Robert was already married to Cersei and they were both followers of the Seven. In the Faith, <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/135551/54887"">a marriage which has been consummated can't be annulled</a> and there is to be no polygamy (unless you have dragons). How did Renly expect Robert to set aside Cersei?</p>

<p>I can only think of two ways he could have done it:</p>

<ol>
<li>Execute Cersei and be done with it. </li>
<li>Pack her off to the Silent Sisters like Ser Quentyn Ball did in order to secure entry into order of the King's Guard. </li>
</ol>

<p>Neither of those two solutions seem to be do-able. Cersei's father, Lord Tywin was basically Robert's wallet, sending her to Silent Sisters would put an end to that unfathomable pocket (Although it would have secured Lord Tyrell as the new Crown-purse) and be a slight on honor of Casterly Rock and Lord Tywin wasn't a man to forgive such things. Executing her would incur Lord Tywin's wrath, power of the Casterly Rock was just as impressive as her wealth, if not more. So how exactly did Renly think that could possibly happen?</p>

"28004","In Game of Thrones, which were the ""Seven Kingdoms"" of Westeros?","<p>Which were the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, before Aegon's Conquest? I don't recall it ever being spelled out. </p>

<p>Only three come to my mind:</p>

<ol>
<li>The North</li>
<li>Dorne</li>
<li>The Iron Islands</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>Edit: Bonus points for naming their ruling houses and seats.</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","28005","<p>Prior to Aegon I Targaryen's conquest, the seven kingdoms of Westeros were:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>The Kingdom of the North</strong> - Ruled by the Starks from their seat at <em>Winterfell</em> who styled themselves the Winter Kings. King Torrehn Stark bent the knee to Aegon I, not wanting to plunge his people into a hopeless war. In return, the Starks were named Wardens of the North.</li>
<li><strong>The Kingdom of the Rock</strong> - Ruled by the Lannisters from their seat at <em>Casterly Rock</em>. King Loren Lannister bent the knee to Aegon I after he was defeated at the battle known as the Field of Fire. The Lannisters were then given the title of Wardens of the West.</li>
<li><strong>The Kingdom of the Stormlands</strong> - Ruled by the Storm Kings of House Durrendon. The last of the Storm Kings was killed by the Baratheons on the behest of Aegon I. The Stormlands are now ruled by the Baratheons from their seat at <em>Storm's End</em>.</li>
<li><strong>The Kingdom of Dorne</strong> - Ruled by the Martells (who style themselves princes, rather than kings) from their seat at <em>Sunspear</em>. The Dornish resisted the Targaryen conquest for 200 years, and were later peacefully joined into the kingdom of Westeros when King Daeron II Targaryen married Princess Myriah Martell.</li>
<li><strong>The Kingdom of the Isles and Rivers</strong>- Ruled by House Hoare. Aegon I's dragons burned the last of the High Kings of the Iron Isles with all his issue at <em>Harrenhal</em>. The kingdom was then split into two regions: the Iron Islands ruled by the Greyjoys from their seat at <em>Pyke</em>, with the Riverlands given to house Tully who rule it from their seat at <em>Riverrun</em>.</li>
<li><strong>The Kingdom of the Reach</strong> - Ruled by House Gardener. The Gardeners were extinguished when King Mern IX Gardener perished at the Field of Fire. Aegon I gave the Reach to the Gardeners' stewards, the Tyrells, who rule it from their seat at <em>Highgarden</em> as the Wardens of the South.</li>
<li><strong>The Kingdom of Mountain and Vale</strong> - Ruled by the Arryns, from their seat at <em>The Eyrie</em>. Ronnel Arryn (just a young boy at the time) bent the knee to Aegon I when he was impressed by their dragons and decided he wanted to ride one. The Arryns continued to rule the Vale as the Wardens of the East.</li>

"28052","Why do they still refer to the ""Seven Kingdoms"" in Game of Thrones?","<p>As I understand it, the ""Seven Kingdoms"" refer to the kingdoms before Aegon's Conquest. Aren't there more kingdoms around the time that the first book is set? (For example, the Iron Islands and Riverlands are now two kingdoms, right?)</p>

<p>So why does everyone refer to there being seven?</p>

<p>For example, Robert says to Ned:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""In the South, the way they talk about my Seven Kingdoms, a man forgets that your part is as big as the other six combined.""</p>

<p>If there ARE still Seven Kingdoms, and I'm wrong, which are the <strong>contemporary</strong> Seven Kingdoms, and which are the Houses that rule them?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><game-of-thrones>","28053","<p>After the Conquest there were no more kingdoms (plural), just <strong>one single kingdom</strong> under the Iron Throne founded by the Targaryens and now ruled by the Baratheons. But the story of the Targaryens conquering the Seven Kingdoms of old is now an intrinsic part of the lore of the land, and the stuff of legend. So when people refer to the Seven Kingdoms, they really mean the lands that were <em>once</em> ruled as seven separate kingdoms before the rise of Aegon I. You can say it's a romantic way to refer to Westeros.</p>

<p>A real life analogue would be the UK, which is more officially known as <strong>The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</strong>. There's only one kingdom, but it was once many kingdoms that united into one.</p>

<li><strong>The Riverlands</strong>. South of the Neck and encompassing the fertile area containing much of Westeros's rivers (hence the name). It is ruled by House Tully from their seat at Riverrun.</li>
<li><strong>The Westerlands</strong>. The area to the west of Westeros. It is ruled by House Lannister from their seat at Casterly Rock.</li>
<li><strong>The Iron Islands</strong>. Seven large islands to the north west of Westeros.. They are ruled by House Grayjoy from their seat at Pyke.</li>
<li><strong>The Vale of Arryn</strong>. A mountainous area to the east of Westeros. It is ruled by House Arryn from their seat at The Eyrie.</li>
<li><strong>The Crownlands</strong>. The area surrounding the capital, King's Landing. It is directly ruled by the Crown (at the time King Robert Baratheon, first of his name ... etc etc.)</li>

<blockquote>

<p>What does she mean by shades? Surely they can't be the Others as Craster has been giving his sons to the Others way long before they started digging the graves. What are these shades Ygritte has mentioned?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","235519","<p>I believe the simple answer is using the term &quot;shades&quot; to mean &quot;ghosts&quot;.</p>

<p>This makes sense in context as they are opening graves and therefore letting the ghosts of the dead back into the world.</p>
<p>Shade is used to refer to ghosts/spirits of the dead elsewhere in the books.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>In the above reference we know all those characters to be dead so therefore would be shades. I feel the last Davos quote is most telling in this regard as it mentions the direct reference to the dead returning as shades.</p>

"166366","Was Ned Stark actually a good swordsman?","<p>Inspired by this question (<a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/87012/is-there-any-proof-that-jaime-lannister-is-actually-a-good-swordsman"">Is there any proof that Jaime Lannister is actually a good swordsman?</a>), the OP mentions Ned in a way that he thinks Ned is a great swordsman. I don't recall anything from the books or show that indicate anything at all about his swordsmanship, he's usually talked about it terms of his honor, or skill as a commander.  Aside from vague ""we were great once, Ned"" comments from Robert (and weren't we <em>all</em> great in our youth? :) ), what evidence do we have that Ned was notable as a swordsman?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","166367","<h3>Books Answer</h3>
<p>No there is no such proof or indication about Ned's talents.</p>
<p>He was an aristocrat so obviously he received martial training but never quite shone like many other big names of Westeros.</p>
<p>As you noted, he is known for his honesty and honor, not for his skills as a fighter.</p>
<p>He must have been good enough however as he fought directly in many battles including the raid at Tower of Joy but there is no evidence suggesting that he was a great warrior.</p>
<p>Others like Jaime, Arthur Dayne, Barristan Selmy, Loras Tyrell, Garlan Tyrell, Oberyn Martell, Lyn Corbray, Qhorin Halfhand etc are all described as exceptionally gifted. Even Robert was counted as a great warrior once. The same has never been said about Ned.</p>
<p>And he is not alone in it, the same has never been said about Tywin Lannister, Jon Arryn or Hoster Tully either. Mace Tyrell is explicitly called out as an incompetent Commander. I am actually glad that ASOIAF doesn't follow the silly tropes that the <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>Good Guy</em></a> (there are no good guys in the series but that's how some people view Ned) is supposed to be a great warrior, oh and warning, TV Tropes link. Ned has other redeeming talents, he was great at administration and laws.</p>
<p>So in conclusion, there is neither any evidence, nor a claim in the first place that Eddard was among the biggest fighting stars of Westeros.</p>
<p>And I have found a <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/FAQ/Entry/How_good_a_swordsman_was_Ned"" rel=""noreferrer"">Citadel entry on this same question</a>. This is what GRRM is reported to have said himself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GRRM has previously stated that Eddard was a competent swordsman.
However, Brandon was the real swordsman in the family (SSC).</p>

<p>If George says he was a competent (and therefore not an exceptional one) swordsman, I guess that settles it. Good enough but not Excellent.</p>

<p>Catelyn Stark answered your question when Robb wondered the same. If Freys are bannermen to Tullys, they ought to let Starks pass.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Walder Frey, Lord of the Crossing, had assembled a force of near four
thousand men at his castles on the Green Fork.</p>
<p>“Late again,” Catelyn murmured when she heard. It was the Trident all
over, damn the man. Her brother Edmure had called the banners; by
rights, Lord Frey should have gone to join the Tully host at Riverrun,
yet here he sat.</p>
<p>“Four thousand men,” Robb repeated, more perplexed than angry. “Lord
Frey cannot hope to fight the Lannisters by himself. Surely he means
to join his power to ours.”</p>
<p>“Does he?” Catelyn asked. She had ridden forward to join Robb and
Robett Glover, his companion of the day. The vanguard spread out
behind them, a slow-moving forest of lances and banners and spears. “I
wonder. <strong>Expect nothing of Walder Frey, and you will never be</strong>
<strong>surprised.</strong>”</p>
<p><strong>&quot;He's your father's bannerman.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Some men take their oaths more seriously than others, Robb</strong>. And Lord
Walder was always friendlier with Casterly Rock than my father would
have liked. One of his sons is wed to Tywin Lannister's sister. That
means little of itself, to be sure. Lord Walder has sired a great many
children over the years, and they must needs marry someone. Still

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Do you think he means to betray us to the Lannisters, my lady?&quot;
Robett Glover asked gravely.</p>

<strong>Lord Frey intends to do.</strong> He has an old man's caution and a young man's
ambition, and has never lacked for cunning.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Precedent for vassals turning against Overlords in favor of Crown</h3>
<p>Earlier, Catelyn wondered where the loyalties of her Father's bannermen lie:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Her father was the staunchest man who'd ever lived, and she had no
doubt that he would call his banners … but would the banners come? The
<strong>Darrys and Rygers and Mootons had sworn oaths to Riverrun as well, yet</strong>
<strong>they had fought with Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident</strong>, while Lord Frey
had arrived with his levies well after the battle was over, leaving
some doubt as to which army he had planned to join (theirs, he had
assured the victors solemnly in the aftermath, but ever after her
father had called him the Late Lord Frey).<br><sub><em><strong>AGOT - Catelyn
V</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Lord Walder's Position</h3>
<p>Lord Frey however said that he wanted to go to Riverrun but he was waiting for his full levies to gather and Edmure lost before that. As to his vows, he correctly points out that he swore vows to the Crown as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Now that I have observed the courtesies, my lady, perhaps my sons
will do me the honor of shutting their mouths. <strong>Why are you here?</strong>”</p>
<p>“<strong>To ask you to open your gates</strong>, my lord,” Catelyn replied politely.
“My son and his lords bannermen are most anxious to cross the river
and be on their way.”</p>
<p>“<strong>To Riverrun?</strong>” He sniggered. “Oh, no need to tell me, no need. I’m not
blind yet. The old man can still read a map.”</p>
<p>“<strong>To Riverrun,</strong>” Catelyn confirmed. She saw no reason to deny it. “<strong>Where</strong>
<strong>I might have expected to find you, my lord. You are still my father’s</strong>
<strong>bannerman, are you not?</strong>”</p>
<p>“Heh, “ said Lord Walder, a noise halfway between a laugh and a grunt.
“<strong>I called my swords, yes I did, here they are, you saw them on the</strong>
<strong>walls. It was my intent to march as soon as all my strength was</strong>
<strong>assembled.</strong> Well, to send my sons. I am well past marching myself, Lady
Catelyn.” He looked around for likely confirmation and pointed to a
tall, stooped man of fifty years. “Tell her, Jared. Tell her that was
my intent.”</p>
<p>“It was, my lady,” said Ser Jared Frey, one of his sons by his second
wife. “On my honor.”</p>
<p>“<strong>Is it my fault that your fool brother lost his battle before we could</strong>
<strong>march?</strong>” He leaned back against his cushions and scowled at her, as if
challenging her to dispute his version of events. “I am told the
Kingslayer went through him like an axe through ripe cheese. Why
should my boys hurry south to die? All those who did go south are
running north again.”<br><sub><em><strong>AGOT - Catelyn IX</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>We want to cross</strong>,” Catelyn told him.</p>
<p>“Oh, do you? That’s blunt. <strong>Why should I let you?</strong>”</p>
<p>For a moment her anger flared. “If you were strong enough to climb
your own battlements,  Lord Frey, <strong>you would see that my son has twenty thousand men outside</strong>
your walls.”</p>
<p>“<strong>They’ll be twenty thousand fresh corpses when Lord Tywin gets here</strong>,”
the old man shot back. “Don’t you try and frighten me, my lady. Your
husband’s in some traitor’s cell under the Red Keep, your father’s
sick, might be dying, and Jaime Lannister’s got your brother in
chains. <strong>What do you have that I should fear</strong>? That son of yours? I’ll
match you son for son, and I’ll still have eighteen when yours are all
dead.”</p>
<p>“<strong>You swore an oath to my father</strong>,” Catelyn reminded him.</p>
<p>He bobbed his head side to side, smiling. “Oh, yes, I said some words,
<strong>but I swore oaths to the crown too, it seems to me. Joffrey’s the king</strong>
now, and that makes you and your boy and all those fools out there no
better than rebels. If I had the sense the gods gave a fish, I’d help
the Lannisters boil you all.”<br><sub><em><strong>AGOT - Catelyn IX</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Lord Walder Remembers</h3>
<p>Then he expressed his resentment on various insults by House Tully:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Your lord father did not come to the wedding.</strong> An insult, as I see it.
Even if he is dying. He never came to my last wedding either. <strong>He calls</strong>
<strong>me the Late Lord Frey</strong>, you know. Does he think I’m dead? I’m not dead,
and I promise you, I’ll outlive him as I outlived his father. <strong>Your</strong>
<strong>family has always pissed on me</strong>, don’t deny it, don’t lie, you know
it’s true. Years ago, <strong>I went to your father and suggested a match</strong>
<strong>between his son and my daughter</strong>. Why not? I had a daughter in mind,
sweet girl, only a few years older than Edmure, but if your brother
didn’t warm to her, I had others he might have had, young ones, old
ones, virgins, widows, whatever he wanted. <strong>No, Lord Hoster would not</strong>
<strong>hear of it</strong>. Sweet words he gave me, excuses, but what I wanted was to
get rid of a daughter.</p>
<p>“<strong>And your sister, that one, she’s full as bad.</strong></p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>I proposed that Lord and Lady Arryn <strong>foster two of my grandsons</strong> at
court, and offered to <strong>take their own son to ward here at the Twins</strong>.
Are my grandsons unworthy to be seen at the king’s court?</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p><strong>Lord Arryn wouldn’t have him, or the other one, and I blame your lady</strong>
<strong>sister for that</strong>. She frosted up as if I’d suggested selling her boy to
a mummer’s show or making a eunuch out of him<br><sub><em><strong>AGOT - Catelyn IX</strong></em></sub></p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>So in conclusion:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lord Walder is a cautious man who takes no unnecessary risks. Why should he take field for a side that was losing?</li>
<li>Lord Walder is legally bound to follow his liege lord but he is also legally bound to be faithful to the Crown. Of course vows mean little to a man like him, he has never been overly conscious about them. But there is precedent, in previous wars against the Crown, many Lords forswore their local overlords and fought for the King.</li>
<li>He has Kinship with Lord Tywin. Lord Tywin's beloved sister Genna Lannister is his daughter-in-law. He can be sure that even if Tywin Lannister destroys everyone else, House Frey will be secure, leaving him little to worry about.</li>
<li>Walder Frey could only sense ruin in Tully camp, why should he join it? Any Tully Power which could exact retribution is shattered by Jaime. Of course he is not blind, the Starks were here and sooner or later it was expected Arryns would be here as well. Together, they gave the Tullys a winning chance but to enter Riverlands without risking a battle with Tywin Lannister at Ruby Ford, they needed Lord of the Crossing which gave him enormous leverage, something he wasn't willing to give up for nothing. Now was the time to get something in return.</li>
<li>Lord Walder is not overly fond of Tullys, Starks, Arryns or Lannister. He hates that they all look down upon him. He hates that Lord Hoster Tully didn't take his daughter as daughter in law. He hates that Arryns refused to foster his grand kids.</li>

<p>So TLDR, Tullys could order the Freys but would the Freys listen? Unlikely.</p>

"98826","Do fighters in the Game Of Thrones books not wear helmets?","<p>I just watched <em>Game of Thrones</em> HBO Season 4, and after the trial by combat (where one duelist wears a helmet, and the outcome might've been different if they both had), I noticed that later combats too had several people in armor but no helmets which had a lot of head injury (hammer through skull, head vs. anvil, people in full armor but no helmets punching each other in the face). All of these situations would have been affected by wearing helmets. </p>

<p>I'm wondering if this is just a video thing (creators assume audience wants to see faces), or if in the books, too, these people and others are often wearing full armor but no helmets and suffering for it.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><adaptation-comparison>","98861","<p>Sometimes there are advantages of being lightly armored. When Bronn fought Ser Vardis Egen as Tyrion Lannister's champion at Eyrie, Bronn was lightly armored and he was able to tire Ser Vardis Egen out. Ser Vardis Egen was dressed in steel from head to heel and found it hard to move.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ser Vardis Egen was steel from head to heel, encased in heavy plate armor over mail and padded surcoat. Large circular rondels, enameled cream-and-blue in the moon-and-falcon sigil of House Arryn, protected the vulnerable juncture of arm and breast. A skirt of lobstered metal covered him from waist to midthigh, while a solid gorget encircled his throat. Falcon’s wings sprouted from the temples of his helm, and his visor was a pointed metal beak with a narrow slit for vision.</p>
<p>Bronn was so lightly armored he looked almost naked beside the knight. He wore only a shirt of black oiled ringmail over boiled leather, a round steel halfhelm with a noseguard, and a mail coif. High leather boots with steel shinguards gave some protection to his legs, and discs of black iron were sewn into the fingers of his gloves. Yet Catelyn noted that the sellsword stood half a hand taller than his foe, with a longer reach ... and Bronn was fifteen years younger, if she was any judge.</p>

<p>Fighting with helmet can restrict the vision range for a fighter and there can be other issues as mentioned below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The slot in his helm limited Tyrion’s vision to what was before him, but when he turned his head he saw three galleys beached on the tourney grounds, and a fourth, larger than the others, standing well out into the river, firing barrels of burning pitch from a catapult.</p>
<p>A naked man fell from the sky and landed on the deck, body bursting like a melon dropped from a tower. His blood spattered through the slit of Tyrion’s helm. Stones began to plummet down, crashing through the decks and turning men to pulp, until the whole bridge gave a shudder and twisted violently underfoot, knocking him sideways.</p>
<p>Suddenly the river was pouring into his helm. He ripped it off and crawled along the listing deck until the water was only neck deep.</p>

<h1>Generally in Westeros it is considered to be stupid to fight without a helm (helmet)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>“Don’t be impertinent. Cersei has a royal wedding to plan, I am waging a war, and you have been out of danger for at least a fortnight.” Lord Tywin studied his son’s disfigured face, his pale green eyes unflinching. “Though the wound is ghastly enough, I’ll grant you. What madness possessed you?”</p>
<p>“The foe was at the gates with a battering ram. If Jaime had led the sortie, you’d call it valor.”</p>
<p>“Jaime would never be so foolish as to remove his helm in battle. I trust you killed the man who cut you?”</p>
<p><sub><sup>A Storm of Swords</sub></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Updating the answer to include Tyrion's trial by battle.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tyrion had his own doubts, now that they stood on the brink. When he looked at Prince Oberyn, he found himself wishing he had Bronn defending him . . . or even better, Jaime. The Red Viper was lightly armored; greaves, vambraces, gorget, spaulder, steel codpiece. Elsewise Oberyn was clad in supple leather and flowing silks. Over his byrnie he wore his scales of gleaming copper, but mail and scale together would not give him a quarter the protection of Gregor’s heavy plate. With its visor removed, the prince’s helm was effectively no better than a half- helm, lacking even a nasal.

Clegane is losing sight of him.</strong> The Mountain’s helm had a narrow eyeslit, severely limiting his vision. Oberyn was making good use of that, and the length of his spear, and his quickness.</p>

"167147","Are the ""people"" re-incarnated by the Lord of Light real?","<p>At first glance this question may seem a little weird, but bare with.</p>

<p>I was having a discussion with some people and looking at Beric Dondarrion's <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Beric_Dondarrion"" rel=""noreferrer"">wiki page</a> which shows a video describing Beric. In the video they mention that George R.R. Martin calls Beric a ""<em>fire wight</em>"". If this is anything like the wights of the Army of the Dead, Beric must be just that: dead, but alive. So <em>Un</em>-dead.</p>

<p>If this is true, would that mean all those re-incarnated by the Lord of Light are not actually alive? Is there evidence to suggest Jon Snow is not a real human anymore? If they're not actually alive are they all Fire Wights?</p>

<p>A snippet I've seen of an interview with GRRM seems to confirm the Beric isn't alive:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>His heart isn’t beating, his blood isn’t flowing in his veins, he’s a wight, but a wight animated by fire instead of by ice, now we’re getting back to the whole fire and ice thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there evidence to suggest that this applies to just Beric or is everyone who's been re-incarnated actually <em>(un)dead</em>?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><jon-snow>","167149","<p>TL;DR - From the books perspective it seems that all those brought back by The Lord of Light are ""undead"". The shows perspective is not as clear. </p>

<hr>

<p>The quote you have provided was part of a larger <a href=""http://time.com/4791258/game-of-thrones-george-r-r-martin-interview/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Time interview</a>. Here it is in context: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q: <strong>Did Lady Stoneheart come about because it was hard to say a permanent goodbye to Catelyn?</strong></p>
  
  <p>A: Yeah, maybe. That may have been part of it. Part of it was also, it’s the dialogue that I was talking about. And here I’ve got to get back to Tolkien again. And I’m going to seem like I’m criticizing him, which I guess I am. It’s always bothered me that Gandalf comes back from the dead. The Red Wedding for me in Lord of the Rings is the mines of Moria, and when Gandalf falls — it’s a devastating moment! I didn’t see it coming at 13 years old, it just totally took me by surprise. Gandalf can’t die! He’s the guy that knows all of the things that are happening! He’s one of the main heroes here! Oh god, what are they going to do without Gandalf? Now it’s just the hobbits?! And Boromir, and Aragorn? Well, maybe Aragorn will do, but it’s just a huge moment. A huge emotional investment.
  And then in the next book, he shows up again, and it was six months between the American publications of those books, which seemed like a million years to me. So all that time I thought Gandalf was dead, and now he’s back and now he’s Gandalf the White. And, ehh, he’s more or less the same as always, except he’s more powerful. It always felt a little bit like a cheat to me. And as I got older and considered it more, i<strong>t also seemed to me that death doesn’t make you more powerful.</strong> That’s, in some ways, me talking to Tolkien in the dialogue, saying, <strong>“Yeah, if someone comes back from being dead, especially if they suffer a violent, traumatic death, they’re not going to come back as nice as ever.""</strong> That’s what I was trying to do, and am still trying to do, with the Lady Stoneheart character.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Q: And Jon Snow, too, is drained by the experience of coming back from the dead on the show.</strong></p>
  
  <p>Right. And <strong>poor Beric Dondarrion, who was set up as the foreshadowing of all this</strong>, every time he’s a little less Beric. His memories are fading, he’s got all these scars, he’s becoming more and more physically hideous, <strong>because he’s not a living human being anymore.</strong> His heart isn’t beating, his blood isn’t flowing in his veins, he’s a wight, but a wight animated by fire instead of by ice, now we’re getting back to the whole fire and ice thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we see the lead-in is Lady Stoneheart (the prior question was about how the Red Wedding was hardest scene for George to write). That gives us the link that Berric, Caetlyn, and Jon have all been resurrected, and all in the same way. </p>

<p>I tend to look at these answers from George pertain more to his books than the show. He even alludes to that  in the same interview: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>I’ve sat out seasons 6 and 7 too,</strong> just trying to concentrate on this book, which as you know is massively late. So in that sense, my involvement in the show has diminished over time, though, I’m still here whenever they want to talk to me, and I’m always glad to weigh in.</p>
  
  <p>... ...</p>
  
  <p>I think one of the biggest ones would probably be when they made the decision not to bring Catelyn Stark back as Lady Stoneheart. That was probably the first major diversion of the show from the books and, you know, I argued against that, and David and Dan made that decision.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We know Jon has not been brought yet back in the books, this seems to major a plot point to change. However, Jon does seem ""alive"" (we see take some big gasps of air when is first revived) in the show and since Lady Stoneheart was cut from the show. Dan and Dave may not follow the whole ""fire wight"" path.</p>

"167337","Has Nymeria been following Arya this whole time?","<p>I was re-reading A Clash of Kings today and I noticed this passage when Arya snuck far into the forest to make some water:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""
  She was making water, her clothing tangled about her ankles, when she heard rustling from under the trees. Hot Pie, she
  thought in panic, he followed me. Then she saw the eyes shining out from the wood, bright with reflected moonlight. Her belly
  clenched tight as she grabbed for Needle, not caring if she pissed herself, counting eyes, two four eight twelve, a whole pack . .
  .
  One of them came padding out from under the trees. He stared at her, and bared his teeth, and all she could think was how
  stupid she‟d been and how Hot Pie would gloat when they found her half-eaten body the next morning. But the wolf turned and
  raced back into the darkness, and quick as that the eyes were gone""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This got me thinking after watching the reunion in Season 7, then reading this. Can anyone confirm that Nymeria called the wolves off or was with them? Have there been other instances like this that I missed in previous read? I really want to think that Nymeria has been keeping watch over Arya this whole time...</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","167341","<h2>No.</h2>
<p>It's not in the show but in the books, Arya has a couple of warg dreams where she sees through Nymeria's eyes, essentially prowling the forests of what's strongly implied to be the Riverlands.</p>
<p>From <em>A Storm of Swords II: Blood and Gold</em> (Chapter 65, <em>Arya XII</em>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By the time they found themselves in the <strong>foothills of the Mountains of the Moon</strong>, the rains had mostly stopped. Arya could see the sun and moon and stars, and it seemed to her that they were <strong>heading eastwards</strong>. &quot;Where are we going?&quot; she asked again.</p>
<p>This time the Hound answered her. &quot;You have an aunt in the <strong>Eyrie</strong>. Might be she'll want to ransom your scrawny arse, though the gods know why. Once we find the high road, we can follow it all the way to the Bloody Gate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As shown in this quote, by this time Arya and the Hound have left the Riverlands behind and are moving towards the Vale of Arryn. Around that time, Arya has a very vivid dream:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That night she went to sleep thinking of her mother, and wondering if she should kill the Hound in his sleep and rescue Lady Catelyn herself. When she closed her eyes she saw her mother's face against the back of her eyelids. <em>She's so close I could almost smell her</em> ...</p>
<p>... and then she <em>could</em> smell her. The scent was faint beneath the other smells, beneath moss and mud and water, and the stench of rotting reeds and rotting men. She padded slowly through the soft ground to the <strong>river's edge</strong>, lapped up a drink, then lifted her head to sniff. The sky was grey and thick with cloud, <strong>the river</strong> green and full of floating things. Dead men clogged the shallows, some still moving as the water pushed them, others washed up on the banks. Her brothers and sisters swarmed around them, tearing at the ripe flesh.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While not identified by name, the river mentioned there is implied to be the Greenfork (the river at the Twins), way back in the Riverlands.</p>
<p>From <em>A Dance with Dragons II: After the Feast</em> (Chapter 45, <em>The Blind Girl</em>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She opened her eyes and stared up blind at the black that shrouded her, her dream already fading. <em>So beautiful.</em> She licked her lips, remembering. The bleating of the sheep, the terror in the shepherd's eyes, the sounds the dogs made as she killed them one by one, the snarling of her pack. Game had become scarcer since the snows began to fall, but last night they had feasted. Lamb and dog and mutton and the flesh of man. Some of her little grey cousins were afraid of men, even dead men, but not her. Meat was meat, and men were prey. She was the night wolf.</p>
<p>But only when she dreamed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, it's even more obvious. Nymeria is still back in <strong>Westeros</strong> (where winter is settling in) and while the exact region is never identified, she's certainly nowhere near Arya who's in <strong>Braavos</strong> at the time.</p>
<p>There are also several mentions of a giant wolf pack terrorizing the Riverlands.</p>
<p>From <em>A Feast for Crows</em> (Chapter 44, <em>Jaime VII</em>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The next day, Ser Dermot of the Rainwood returned to the castle, empty-handed. When asked what he'd found, he answered, &quot;Wolves. Hundreds of bloody beggars.&quot; He'd lost two sentries to them. The wolves had come out of the dark to savage them. &quot;Armed men in mail and boiled leather, and yet the beasts had no fear of them. Before he died, Jate said the pack was led by a she-wolf of monstrous size. A direwolf, to hear him tell it. [...]</p>
<p>&quot;A ring of fires round your camp might keep them off,&quot; said Jaime, though he wondered. Could Ser Dermot's wolf be the same beast that had mauled Joffrey near the crossroads?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This time the area is clearly identified: Jaime is at Riverrun at the time. Arya, meanwhile, has left Westeros and has spent quite some time already in Braavos.</p>
<p>It seems like Nymeria pretty much remained in the area where Arya left her back in <em>The Game of Thrones</em> and made it her pack's territory. This is also where Arya encounters the pack mentioned in your quote and where she meets Nymeria in season 7.</p>

"99023","Do the Dothraki practice extramarital sex?","<p>Obviously, raping and pillaging is a large part of Dothraki culture, however they do take wives. So I'm wondering, once a Dothraki man is wed, will he still take part in rape and sex with other women?  </p>

<p>In the show, I remember Drogo once mentioning that he will rape the women of Westeros, but I'm not sure if he mentions that in the book.  Other than that moment, it seems that Drogo is devoted to Dany.</p>

<p>To be clear, I am looking for evidence from the books, not the HBO series.</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","99036","<p>I believe you were looking for this. Drogo says this after failed attempt to poison Dany. So this is after their marriage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“And to Rhaego son of Drogo, the stallion who will mount the world, to him I also pledge a gift. To him I will give this iron chair his mother’s father sat in. I will give him Seven Kingdoms. I, Drogo, khal, will do this thing.” His voice rose, and he lifted his fist to the sky. “I will take my khalasar west to where the world ends, and ride the wooden horses across the black salt water as no khal has done before. I will kill the men in the iron suits and tear down their stone houses. I will rape their women, take their children as slaves, and bring their broken gods back to Vaes Dothrak to bow down beneath the Mother of Mountains. This I vow, I, Drogo son of Bharbo. This I swear before the Mother of Mountains, as the stars look down in witness.”</p>
<p><sub><sup>A Game Of Thrones</sub></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A khal could share his wives with his bloodriders.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every khal had his bloodriders. At first Dany had thought of them as a kind of Dothraki Kingsguard, sworn to protect their lord, but it went further than that. Jhiqui had taught her that a bloodrider was more than a guard; they were the khal’s brothers, his shadows, his fiercest friends. “Blood of my blood,” Drogo called them, and so it was; they shared a single life. The ancient traditions of the horselords demanded that when the khal died, his bloodriders died with him, to ride at his side in the night lands. If the khal died at the hands of some enemy, they lived only long enough to avenge him, and then followed him joyfully into the grave. In some khalasars, Jhiqui said, the bloodriders shared the khal’s wine, his tent, and even his wives, though never his horses. A man’s mount was his own.</p>
<p><sub><sup>A Game Of Thrones</sub></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After conquering a city, Dothraki men would pillage the city and rape all the women they can get their hands on. The survivors would be sold into slavery.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behind them, the girl being raped made a heartrending sound, a long sobbing wail that went on and on and on. Dany’s hand clenched hard around the reins, and she turned the silver’s head. “Make them stop,” she commanded Ser Jorah.</p>
<p>“Khaleesi?” The knight sounded perplexed.</p>
<p>“You heard my words,” she said. “Stop them.” She spoke to her khas in the harsh accents of Dothraki. “Jhogo, Quaro, you will aid Ser Jorah. I want no rape.”</p>
<p>Jorah Mormont spurred his horse closer. “Princess,” he said, “you have a gentle heart, but you do not understand. This is how it has always been. Those men have shed blood for the khal. Now they claim their reward.”</p>
<p><sub><sup>A Game Of Thrones</sub></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even Dothraki weddings involved rape and killing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The warriors were watching too. One of them finally stepped into the circle, grabbed a dancer by the arm, pushed her down to the ground, and mounted her right there, as a stallion mounts a mare. Illyrio had told her that might happen. <strong>“The Dothraki mate like the animals in their herds. There is no privacy in a khalasar, and they do not understand sin or shame as we do.”</strong></p>
<p>Dany looked away from the coupling, frightened when she realized what was happening, but a second warrior stepped forward, and a third, and soon there was no way to avert her eyes. Then two men seized the same woman. She heard a shout, saw a shove, and in the blink of an eye the arakhs were out, long razor-sharp blades, half sword and half scythe. A dance of death began as the warriors circled and slashed, leaping toward each other, whirling the blades around their heads, shrieking insults at each clash. No one made a move to interfere.</p>
<p>It ended as quickly as it began. The arakhs shivered together faster than Dany could follow, one man missed a step, the other swung his blade in a flat arc. Steel bit into flesh just above the Dothraki’s waist, and opened him from backbone to belly button, spilling his entrails into the dust. As the loser died, the winner took hold of the nearest woman—not even the one they had been quarreling over—and had her there and then. Slaves carried off the body, and the dancing resumed.</p>
<p>Magister Illyrio had warned Dany about this too. “A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is deemed a dull affair,” he had said. Her wedding must have been especially blessed; before the day was over, a dozen men had died.</p>

"167654","Why does Jon Snow have dark hair?","<p>Spoilers for Season 6 Episode 10 and Season 7 of <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p>

<p>I have tagged this question also with <a href=""/questions/tagged/a-song-of-ice-and-fire"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;a-song-of-ice-and-fire&#39;"" rel=""tag"">a-song-of-ice-and-fire</a> because I am interested about eventual book details that didn't make it into the show.</p>

<p>I know that in the books Jon's ancestry is still a mystery, but I suppose it won't be much different from what we've seen in the show.</p>

<p>In the show, Jon <strike>Snow</strike> Targaryen is shown to be dark haired, while all other Targaryens are blonde-almost white.</p>

<p>We have seen that the colour of the hair is deemed a good indication as to which family one could belong to (see the ""Baratheon"" children).</p>

<p>Is there a good explanation of why Jon does not fit the Targaryen pattern? Or should it be considered ""hand-wave"" away-able because ""no other Targaryen-Stark child was ever born so it is not a given that he should have Targaryen hair""?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><jon-snow>","167656","<h3>Historical Half Targaryens with Non-Valyrian features</h3>
<p>That's the case with many Half Targaryens in history.</p>
<p>King Daeron II married Mariah Martell. His first born son, Prince Baelor had dark hair of his mother.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of Prince Maekar he saw no sign, but he recognized Prince Baelor at
Lord Ashford's side. Sunlight flashed golden off the shoulder clasp
that held his cloak and the slim coronet about his temples, but
otherwise he dressed far more simply than most of the other lords.
<strong>He does not look a Targaryen in truth, with that dark hair</strong>. Dunk said as much to Egg.</p>
<p>&quot;It's said <strong>he favors his mother</strong>,&quot; the boy reminded him. &quot;<strong>She was
a Dornish princess.</strong>&quot;<br><sub><strong>Dunk and Egg: The Hedge Knight</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prince Baelor's own sons Valarr and Matarys had the same hair.</p>
<p>King Daeron's fourth son, Maekar had Targaryen silver hair. But he married a Dayne. So his first born son, Prince Daeron also had the common hair instead of the silver-gold hair of Targaryens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dunk chewed, swallowed, and tore off some more bread. &quot;Why did you do
it? Was it some jape, to make a fool of the stupid hedge knight?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No.&quot; The boy's eyes filled with tears, but he stood there manfully.
&quot;I was supposed to squire for Daeron. He's my oldest brother. I
learned everything I had to learn to be a good squire, but Daeron
isn't a very good knight. He didn't want to ride in the tourney, so
after we left Summerhall he stole away from our escort, only instead
of doubling back he went straight on toward Ashford, thinking they'd
never look for us that way. It was him shaved my head. He knew my
father would send men hunting us. <strong>Daeron has common hair, sort of a
pale brown, nothing special, but mine is like Aerion's and my
father's</strong>.&quot;<br><sub><strong>Dunk and Egg: The Hedge Knight</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, Ser Harwin Strong fathered three bastard sons on Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen , all of them inherited their real father's brown hair (But supposedly their legal father was Laenor Velaryon, who didn't care about getting cuckolded).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever the truth of these tales, it was soon announced that the
princess was with child. Born in the waning days of 114 AC, <strong>the boy
was a large, strapping lad, with brown hair, brown eyes, and a pug
nose</strong> (Ser Laenor had the aquiline nose, silver-white hair, and
purple eyes that bespoke his Valyrian blood). Laenor’s wish to name
the child Joffrey was overruled by his father, Lord Corlys. Instead
the child was given a traditional Velaryon name: Jacaerys (friends and
brothers would call him Jace).<br><sub><strong>The Rogue Prince</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Princess Rhaenyra had given birth to a second son</strong> late in the year 115 AC. The child was named Lucerys (Luke for short). Septon Eustace
tells us that both Ser Laenor and Ser Harwin were at Rhaenyra’s
bedside for his birth. <strong>Like his brother Jace, Luke had brown eyes
and a healthy head of brown hair</strong>, rather than the silver-gilt hair
of Targaryen princelings<br><sub><strong>The Rogue Prince</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 117 AC, on Dragonstone, Princess Rhaenyra bore yet another son. Ser
Laenor was at last permitted to name a child after his fallen friend,
Ser Joffrey Lonmouth. <strong>Joffrey Velaryon was as big and red-faced and
healthy as his brothers, but like them he had brown hair, brown eyes,
and features that some at court called common</strong>. The whispering began
again. Amongst the greens, it was an article of faith that the father
of Rhaenyra’s sons was not her husband Laenor, but her champion,
Harwin Strong.<br><sub><strong>The Rogue Prince</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other than that, King Aegon IV sired a ripe crop of bastards. Three of them were sired on a black courtesan, named Bellenora, Narha and Balerion. Their description is not given but since Bellenora came to be known as the Black Pearl of Bravos, I suppose she was black as were her siblings. He also had Aegor Rivers, better known as Bittersteel, the founder of Golden Company, with Lady Barba Bracken. The lad had purple eyes from his father but inherited black hair of his mother.</p>
<p>King Aegon V married Betha Blackwood. His eldest son was a ravenhead. His physical description is not given but his illustration in TWOIAF shows that he inherited raven locks of his mother, unlike his brothers and sisters.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rYP9d.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rYP9d.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>And most Recently, Prince Rhaegar's children with Elia Martell are good example. Rhaenys took after her mother and inherited her dark hair but Aegon took after his father. So among all three of Rhaegar's children, only Aegon took after him while Rhaenys and Jon took after their mothers.</p>
<h3>Historical Half Targaryens with Valyrian features</h3>
<p>While it can happen (Half-Targaryens taking after non-Targaryen parent), as we see evidence above, it is not something which always happens.</p>
<p>King Aegon V married Betha Blackwood, all of their children were your typical Targaryens except the eldest Prince Duncan the Small, Prince of Dragonflies (See above).</p>
<p>King Daeron II's all children were Typical Targaryens except Baelor Breakspear.</p>
<p>King Maekar's all children were typical Targaryen except Daeron Targaryen.</p>
<p>Princess Rhaenyra's mother was an Arryn (although Lady Aemma Arryn herself was a half Targaryen and cousin to her husband), but she was typical Targaryen. Rhaenra's half siblings Aegon II, Aemond, Daeron and Helaena were all typical Targaryens as well despite having a Hightower (Although Alicent Hightower's hair color is not mentioned) for their mother.</p>
<h3>Case of Jon and Arya</h3>
<p>So it shouldn't be surprising that when Rhaegar (Silver Gold hair) married Lyanna (Brown hair), their child was born with Brown hair as Silver-Gold is a recessive gene, while Brown is dominant.</p>
<p>Jon had the brown hair of Starks, which he inherited from his mother. Arya inherited the same from her father.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would have been easier if Arya had been a bastard, like their half
brother Jon. She even looked like Jon, with the long face and brown hair of
the Starks, and nothing of their lady mother in her face or her
coloring. <br><sub><strong>AGOT: Sansa I</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They both also had the Grey eyes of Starks. While everyone wondered who was Jon's mother who left nothing of her in him, It was actually his father who left nothing of him in Jon.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In any case, Jon had a good enough chance of getting Targaryen outlook but his mother's genes won and he was born lucky, looking like a Stark, making it feasible for Eddard to lie. Otherwise explaining a Valyrian looking bastard would have been really hard. Would have gone something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Robert: Say Eddard, how did you sire a Valyrian looking bastard?</p>
<p>Ned: I went to Lys.</p>
<p>Robert: When? You never had the time to go to Lys.</p>
<p>Ned: Okay you got me. I had an affair with Queen Rhaella.</p>
<p>Robert: Rhaella? Hmm I don't see the timeline match but she was with
child when she fled. But her Child was Daenerys Stormborn.</p>
<p>Ned: She's my daughter too. Jon's twin.</p>
<p>Robert: GODDAMMIT NED! TELL THE TRUTH!</p>

<p>Have other men been the Three-Eyed Raven before this man? Or has the Raven previously been Children of the Forest?</p>

<p>I think that the basic premise of your question is based on assumptions that don't have many facts that support them. Even if on a first impression one could be lead to think so, <strong>there is no evidence that both &quot;Three-Eyed Crow&quot; and &quot;Greenseer&quot; are titles or positions to be held</strong>, that are passed form one person to another, in the same fashion of nobiliar titles, religious hierarchy or other titles granted to leaders (like, in example,  the King of the North, the High Septon, the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, and so on).</p>
<h1>About Greenseers.</h1>
<p>We can gather informations about Greenseers mainly from Bran's chapters of the novels:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;They were a people dark and beautiful, small of stature, no taller than children even when grown to manhood. They lived in the depths of the wood, in caves and crannogs and secret tree towns. Slight as they were, the children were quick and graceful. Male and female hunted together, with weirwood bows and flying snares. Their gods were the gods of the forest, stream, and stone, the old gods whose names are secret. <strong>Their wise men were called greenseers, and carved strange faces in the weirwoods to keep watch on the woods.</strong> How long the children reigned here or where they came from, no man can know.<br />
<sub><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Game_of_Thrones-Chapter_66"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A Game of Thrones - Bran VII</a></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Then you teach me.&quot; Bran still feared the three-eyed crow who haunted his dreams sometimes, pecking endlessly at the skin between his eyes and telling him to fly. &quot;You're a greenseer.&quot;<br />
&quot;No,&quot; said Jojen, &quot;only a boy who dreams. <strong>The greenseers were more than that. They were wargs as well, as you are, and the greatest of them could wear the skins of any beast that flies or swims or crawls, and could look through the eyes of the weirwoods as well, and see the truth that lies beneath the world.</strong><br />
<sub><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Storm_of_Swords-Chapter_9"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A Storm of Swords - Bran I</a></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;Only one man in a thousand is born a skinchanger,&quot;</strong> Lord Brynden said one day, after Bran had learned to fly, <strong>&quot;and only one skinchanger in a thousand can be a greenseer.&quot;</strong><br />
&quot;I thought the greenseers were the wizards of the children,&quot; Bran said. &quot;The singers, I mean.&quot;<br />
&quot;In a sense. Those you call the children of the forest have eyes as golden as the sun, but <strong>once in a great while one is born amongst them with eyes as red as blood, or green as the moss on a tree in the heart of the forest. By these signs do the gods mark those they have chosen to receive the gift.</strong> The chosen ones are not robust, and their quick years upon the earth are few, for every song must have its balance. But once inside the wood they linger long indeed. A thousand eyes, a hundred skins, wisdom deep as the roots of ancient trees. <strong>Greenseers.</strong>&quot;<br />
<sub><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Dance_with_Dragons-Chapter_34"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A Dance with Dragons - Bran III</a></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the text, we know that Greenseers were exceptional individuals, in the sense that they were born with abilities that nobody else had, and because of this they seem to have been chosen as the leaders of their people. So, in a way, Greenseer was just an attribute given to a particularly blessed individual,  pretty much like in the real world we could call &quot;genius&quot; someone like Albert Einstein.<br />
It also had the connotation of a position of leadership, but it seems that they acquired this thanks to their abilities, and <strong>there is no proof that only one Greenseer lived at a certain time (the texts seem to imply the other way around), or that there was something like a supreme leader like a organized religion could have</strong>. They seem to be more like druids and tribal shamans rather than a formal hierarchy of priests.<br />
Going on with the example above, we can see that real geniuses are not common even in our world, but we don't have a genius &quot;position&quot; that is filled when the previous one dies; and of course both Einstein and Turing were without a doubt geniuses, and they lived during the same timeframe; I think that we can safely speculate that with Greenseers it was something like that.</p>
<h1>About the Three-eyed Crow. And Brynden Rivers too.</h1>
<p>We know that Bran <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/14567/83101"">sees a Three-eyed Crow in his dreams</a>; there is not much reason to quote every occurrence, it is well established without the need to provide references. It is more interesting to note that even Jojen Reed saw it in one of his green dreams:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jojen's eyes were the color of moss, and sometimes when he looked at you he seemed to be seeing something else. Like now. &quot;<strong>I dreamed of a winged wolf bound to earth with grey stone chains</strong>,&quot; he said. &quot;It was a green dream, so I knew it was true. <strong>A crow was trying to peck through the chains</strong>, but the stone was too hard and his beak could only chip at them.&quot;<br />
<strong>&quot;Did the crow have three eyes?&quot;<br />
Jojen nodded.</strong><br />
<sub><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Clash_of_Kings-Chapter_28"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A Clash of Kings - Bran IV</a></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can see here that these green dreams are made by metaphorical images that have to be correctly interpreted. <strong>Bran never thinks about himself as a Winged Wolf, it is just how Jojen sees him in his dreams; a similar thing could be said for the Three-eyed Crow, it is supposed to be just the dream image of someone else, even if we, like Bran, initially don't know who he could possibly be.</strong> (also check <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/63671/83101"">this question</a>).<br />
Other characters that don't experience green dreams, very likely speak of it just because he listened to him telling his dreams, there is not a single piece of evidence that they have previous knowledge about a Three-Eyed Crow.</p>
<p>When Bran &amp; company arrive at the cave, they met a cadaverous man trapped inside a tree; we know that even if it is not explicitly stated, he is Brynden &quot;Bloodraven&quot; Rivers, I won't go into detail here; just like Jojen was able to tell that his Winged Wolf was Bran when he saw him, Bran was able to recognize his Three-eyed Crow; <strong>it is interesting to note that Bloodraven seems surprised to be called like that</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;Are you the three-eyed crow?&quot;</strong> Bran heard himself say. A three-eyed crow should have three eyes. He has only one, and that one red. Bran could feel the eye staring at him, shining like a pool of blood in the torchlight. Where his other eye should have been, a thin white root grew from an empty socket, down his cheek, and into his neck.<br />
<strong>&quot;A … crow?&quot;</strong> The pale lord's voice was dry. His lips moved slowly, as if they had forgotten how to form words. <strong>&quot;Once, aye. Black of garb and black of blood.&quot;</strong> The clothes he wore were rotten and faded, spotted with moss and eaten through with worms, but once they had been black. &quot;I have been many things, Bran. Now I am as you see me, and now you will understand why I could not come to you … except in dreams. I have watched you for a long time, watched you with a thousand eyes and one. I saw your birth, and that of your lord father before you. I saw your first step, heard your first word, was part of your first dream. I was watching when you fell. And now you are come to me at last, Brandon Stark, though the hour is late.&quot;<br />

</blockquote>
<p>We know that in ASOIAF, dreams and prophecies are never explicit, they are always in the form of images that have to be interpreted; Bran was seen by Jojen as a Winged Wolf because of his House's heraldic emblem, it was a symbolic representation of his identity; pretty much in the same way, Bloodraven was symbolized in the green dreams by a crow, both because of his nickname (derived by the shape and color of his birthmark) and by his past as a member of the Night's Watch (they are called &quot;crows&quot;).<br />
As I have pointed out, <strong>he seems to be surprised to be called like that (he was seen by others in green dreams, but presumably he wasn't present in his own dreams in a symbolic form), and when he answers, he seem to acknowledge more his past as a member of the Night Watch  (&quot;Black of Garb&quot;) rather than the form he took in other's dreams.</strong></p>
<p>As things stands right now, we don't know much about Bloodraven acts and motivations in the Night Watch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ser Brynden Rivers set sail for the Wall late in the year of 233 AC. (No one intercepted his ship). Two hundred men went with him, many of them archers from Bloodraven's personal guard, the Raven's Teeth. The king's brother, Maester Aemon, was also amongst them.<br />
Bloodraven would rise to become Lord Commander of the Night's Watch in 239 AC, serving until his disappearance during a ranging beyond the Wall in 252 AC.<br />

<hr />
<h1>Summarizing</h1>
<p>We know that a very small fraction of the Children of the Forest possessed exceptional powers, and that those individuals were called Greenseers; this name was more of an &quot;attribute&quot;, a &quot;quality&quot;, rather than a formal title or a position to be held. This is further supported by the fact that we also know two examples of humans born with this ability, Bloodraven and Bran Stark: surely they weren't leaders of the Children of the Forest. They were Greenseers too, because of their abilities, not because they were elected, invested, or because somebody else left that &quot;position&quot; vacant; and  You basically are born as a Greenseer, you don't become it.</p>
<p>In a similar way, the Three-eyed Crow was just a symbolic image of a specific person in some other people's green dreams, when directly called like that, Boodraven did not immediately seem to understand; even here, this is the only evidence that we can collect form the text, it is not stated anywhere that this could be a title, a position to be held, or anything like that. <strong>Certainly, nowhere in the books Bran was called Three-eyed Crow, not by Bloodraven handing down the &quot;position&quot; to him, nor by anybody else; he was just being acknowledged as possessing the powers of &quot;a&quot; Greenseer (not &quot;the&quot; Greenseer)</strong>.</p>
<p>We don't even know if there was someone that &quot;called&quot; Bloodraven at the cave in the same fashion as he &quot;called&quot; Bran, or if he went there by his own free will (he was reputed to be a sorceror and a man of great knowledge after all), or even if he arrived there by chance.<br />
Similarly we don't even know if what he is doing here is because he is fulfilling someone else's duty, if he is acting on is own initiative, or in the end why he is here at all, besides teaching Bran to realize himself (we see anything only from the point of view of the little Stark after all).</p>
<p>So, to answer your question:</p>
<p><strong>Literally speaking, we only know that the Three-eyed Crow was a dream image symbolizing Bloodraven, tied to his nickname and birthmark and to his past as a Brother of the Night's Watch. It is highly unlikely that somebody else could be depicted in this way, even Bran was seen as a Winged Wolf. In a way, it was just a nickname like &quot;The Hound&quot; for Sandor Clegane or &quot;The Blackfish&quot; for Brynden Tully.<br />
If we want to use the Three-eyed Crow in a figurative way to describe what Bloodraven is doing, there is no evidence whatsoever that there was really somone before him doing what he is doing now; the assumption that this could be a position that is handed down from an individual to another is just that, an assumption that is not confirmed (or denied, for that matter) anywhere in the books.</strong></p>

"31339","Which last name should the children of Robert and Cersei pass to their children","<p>For example with King Joffrey, he is (I know, I know he really isn't) the descendant of Houses Baratheon and Lannister, so because of that which last name is he passing to his children?</p>

<p>In my country we have two last names, the one of the father and the one of the mother. So my name is <strong>Name last1 last2</strong> and I only pass my first last name to my children, so for example my wife's name is <strong>Mom_Name Mom_last1 Mom_last2</strong> and my children they all will have <strong>Child_Name last1 Mom_last1</strong>, so only the <em>House</em> of the father is passing through time.</p>

<p>Maybe it is different in your countries, that's why I wanted to explain that.</p>

<p>I understand if the last name they pass may be the one with more importance, but it should be a rule, because if not the great name of <em>House Lannister</em> could be lost (Jaime can't have children and Tyrion is not welcome in the family).</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><game-of-thrones>","31342","<p>In the US and much (but not all) of Western Europe, the father's family name is passed on to the children.  This is a tradition going back centuries and is (at least where I live) the ""expected"" thing to do.</p>

<p>So, just as Robb Stark is not a Tully (his mother's family name) Joffrey should legally be a Baratheon, not a Lannister.</p>

<p>In terms of inheritance, Jaime should be first in line, followed by Tyrion.  I'm not sure where Cersei stands, since I don't know whether women can inherit.  If she can't, I would expect the lands/money/what have you to pass to her children <em>even though they are not Lannisters</em> since they are descended from them.  Just as the Iron throne went to Joffrey rather than Stannis or Renly, offspring seem to take precedence over siblings in this political system.</p>

<ul>
<li>Howland Reed</li>
<li>Barristan ""the bold"" Selmy</li>
</ul>

<p>And (ADWD spoilers)</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>- Jon Connington<br>

</blockquote>

<p>Also to be included in the list is of course Howland Reed's children, Jojen and Meera. They did in fact come close to the topic of Rhaegar and Lyanna when they told Bran of the story of the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Knight_of_the_Laughing_Tree"">Knight of the Laughing Tree</a>. So close, in fact, that I half expected they were about to reveal something to Bran.</p>

<p>However, there is another option, stemming from the prophecy that Daenerys got in the House of the Undying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Her silver was trotting through the grass, to a darkling stream beneath a sea of stars. A corpse stood at the prow of a ship, eyes bright on his dead face, gray lips smiling sadly. <em>A blue flower grew from a chink in a wall of ice, and filled the air with sweetness...mother of dragons...bride of death..</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The blue rose is no doubt a reference to Lyanna, as she was notably fond of such. The wall of ice is of course The Wall. And the context in which this is mentioned is ""bride of death"", where the first mentioned ""husband"" is presumably Drogo and the second presumably Victarion. It is fairly reasonable to assume that the third one refers to Jon, since he is presumably Rhaegar and Lyanna's son, and a Targaryen by blood (viable husband), at the Wall, and as of ADWD also (spoiler)</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>dead (bride of death)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, while it is not clear exactly how it will happen, it seems this prophecy indicates that Daenerys will meet Jon at the Wall and his parentage will be revealed somehow. All this is, of course, pure guesswork.</p>

<p>There is also the option which will be completely covered by spoiler tags, since it mainly takes place in ADWD:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>Bran is now a greenseer and an apprentice of Bloodraven. He has already seen Ned Stark with (presumably) Jon and Robb, praying before the heart tree <em>""Let them grow up as brothers""</em>. I think it is probably very likely that Bran will look deeper into history there and find out the truth about Jon.<p>
Bloodraven himself will also have a lot of knowledge about house Stark, as he has been watching them for years. And it is not unlikely that he will have paid close attention to the events surrounding Rhaegar and Lyanna.<p>
Also, it is likely (or perhaps only possible) that Coldhands is in fact Benjen Stark, who might have knowledge of Jon's parentage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it is interesting to note, however, that (ADWD spoiler)</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>...GRRM drops quite a few hints that Jon is actually the son of Ned Stark and a fisherman's daughter. Firstly, it is mentioned in a Davos chapter by the Lord of Sisterton regarding Ned Stark and a fisherman's daughter that ""he left her with a bastard in her belly and a bag of silver"" (paraphrasing). Secondly, Stannis says <em>""You haggle like a crone with a codfish, Lord Snow. Did Ned Stark father you on some fishwife?""</em> And Jon himself thinks something like <em>""Perhaps he did, at that""</em><p>
Although a possibility, I am more inclined to think this is a red herring, however.</p>

<p>Maester Luwin's assessment is very likely. If they had no riders from outside except King's party, it must have been some member of the King's party, but not someone who could be named.</p>

their people had their own magic—a water magic very different from the
sorceries of Valyria, which were woven of blood and fire</strong>. Though

own prince...or princess, for amongst these river folk, women were
regarded as the equals of men.<br><sub>TWOIAF - Ancient History: 10,000 Ships</sub></p>

<p>It was said that Rhoynar could get intel from Mother Rhoyne about threats and raise Watery Walls to protect their cities:</p>

every threat</strong>, that the <strong>Rhoynar princes wielded strange</strong>, uncanny

<h3>Development of Dornish desert</h3>
<p>Later, Nymeria lead her ten thousand ships and landed in Dorne, seeking refuge. While she didn't practice Water Magic herself, some witches came with her who played an important role in development of Dorne:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Rhoynar brought considerable wealth with them; their artisans,
metalworkers, and stonemasons brought skills far in advance of those
achieved by their Westerosi counterparts, and their armorers were soon
producing swords and spears and suits of scale and plate no Westerosi
smith could hope to match. Even more crucially, it is said the
<strong>Rhoynish water witches knew secret spells that made dry streams flow again and deserts bloom</strong>.<br><sub>TWOIAF - Ancient History: 10,000
Ships</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rhoynar wealth, culture and technology gave a cutting edge advantage to the Martells and allowed them to conquer entire Dorne. Current House Martell is officially House Nymeros-Martell, but common usage is just Martell.</p>
<h3>Children of Forest</h3>
<p>Other than the Rhoynar, it appears that Children of the Forest also practiced a certain form of Water Magic. They used it to break the arm of Dorne, to halt the immigration of the First Men, although too late by that point. But as with most of the legends of Children of the Forest, it is doubtful:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But whether <strong>the Breaking took place in a single night, or over the
course of centuries, there can be no doubt that it occurred; the
Stepstones and the Broken Arm of Dorne give mute but eloquent
testimony to its effects</strong>. There is also much to suggest that the Sea
of Dorne was once an inland freshwater sea, fed by mountain streams
and much smaller than it is today, until the narrow sea burst its
bounds and drowned the salt marshes that lay between.</p>
<p>Even if we accept that the <strong>old gods broke the Arm of Dorne with the
Hammer of the Waters, as the legends claim, the greenseers sang their
song too late</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>No more wanderers crossed to Westeros after the Breaking, it is true, for the First Men were no seafarers</strong>...but so many of their
forebears had already made the crossing that they outnumbered the
dwindling elder races almost three to one by the time the lands were
severed, and that disparity only grew in the centuries that followed,
for the women of the First Men brought forth sons and daughters with
much greater frequency than the females of the elder races.<br><sub>TWOIAF - Dorne: the Breaking</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another attempt was made by them in a desperate effort to divide the Continent into two, by breaking it apart on Neck. It didn't succeed however and resulted in only Flooding the Neck and making it a Marshland.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Legend says that <strong>the great floods that</strong> broke the land bridge that is
now the Broken Arm and <strong>made the Neck a swamp were the work of the</strong>
<strong>greenseers</strong>, who gathered at Moat Cailin to work dark
magic.<br><sub>TWOIAF - Ancient History: the Coming of the First

</blockquote>
<h3>Instances in current timeline 298-300 AC</h3>
<p>No there are no instances of Water Magic being practiced in the current timeline.</p>
<p>As we observed, the art is associated with the Rhoynar and the Children of the Forest.</p>
<p>Children of the Forest are extinct now along with all their arts and magic. Well officially at least, they are still alive up North but even there they haven't shown that power yet. There's however a brief mention of the above-mentioned breaking of the broken Arm of Dorne in <em>AGOT</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;But some twelve thousand years ago, <strong>the First Men appeared from the
east, crossing the Broken Arm of Dorne before it was broken</strong>. They
came with bronze swords and great leathern shields, riding horses. No
horse had ever been seen on this side of the narrow sea. No doubt the
children were as frightened by the horses as the First Men were by the
faces in the trees. As the First Men carved out holdfasts and farms,
they cut down the faces and gave them to the fire. Horror-struck, the
children went to war. <strong>The old songs say that the greenseers used
dark magics to make the seas rise and sweep away the land, shattering
the Arm, but it was too late to close the door</strong>. The wars went on
until the earth ran red with blood of men and children both, but more
children than men, for men were bigger and stronger, and wood and
stone and obsidian make a poor match for bronze. Finally the wise of
both races prevailed, and the chiefs and heroes of the First Men met
the greenseers and wood dancers amidst the weirwood groves of a small
island in the great lake called Gods Eye.<br><sub>AGOT - Bran
VII</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the Rhoynar, as we saw, they had to flee from advancing Valyrian dragonlords and take refuge in Dorne. It appears however that modern Rhoynar have forgotten the art of their ancestors (Much like remnants of Valyrians have forgotten the art of their ancestors). This is implied as in <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/135616/54887"">First Dornish War</a>, Rhoynar didn't use Water Magic against Aegon the Conqueror's dragons. In any case, it was the Rhoynar who were the toughest foes of the Valyrians in their conquest of Essos. And it was again the Rhoynar who proved to be the toughest enemies of Valyrians when Aegon the Conqueror began conquest of Westeros.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They aren't exactly ""resurrected"". The walkers (and the Night King in particular), are extremely practised wargs. They are warging into dead bodies. It kind of further bolsters the fan theory that the NK is actually Bran.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was skeptical if this was true so went looking. I managed to dig up <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/3p5xkt/spoilers_all_theory_white_walkers_are_wargs_and/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this reddit post</a> and <a href=""http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/90489-spoilers-adwd-do-white-walkers-warg/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this asoiaf.westeros forum post</a> but they are just some guy's theory.</p>

<p>I can think of evidence against this like:</p>

<ul>
<li>The white walkers' eyes don't go white like Bran's.</li>
<li>The wights seem aimless and surely if they were being controlled they'd be a lot stronger.</li>
</ul>

<p>But is there any evidence to suggest that the white walkers are wargs?</p>

<h3>Difference between Skin-Changing and Warging</h3>
<p>First of all, Warging is a specific type of Skin-Changing, exclusive to targeting canine family. If you are slipping into an organism which is neither a dog nor a wolf, <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/133371/54887"">it's not warging</a>.</p>
<h3>My Speculation</h3>
<p>That being said, Others are still shrouded in mystery in the books. We do not know their powers' nature or extent of their powers.</p>
<p>Based on my own speculation rooted in the canon, I'd say the answer is no.</p>
<p>There is no instance of Skin-Changers possessing multiple skins simultaneously. So it is unlikely that a couple of Skin-Changing Others are inside hundreds of thousands of Wights.</p>
<p>It is more like reanimation with an evil spirit rather than actually slipping into the body of the dead men.</p>
<p>The Art of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Necromancy"" rel=""noreferrer"">Necromancy</a> animates the Wights, not Skin-Changing. As Melisandre, someone well-versed in Dark arts said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Necromancy animates these wights, yet they are still only dead flesh</strong>. Steel and fire will serve for them. The ones you call the
Others are something more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Melisandre has been proven wrong before about many things.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is, Skin-Changers when in their animals' skin, can feel the same pain. Like Varamyr felt burning pain/sensation when his eagle was burnt by Melisandre or how he felt when he was inside his she-wolf and she gave birth to pups or how he felt when his she-wolf was mounted by his other wolves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Varamyr had died nine times before</strong>. He had died once from a spear thrust, once with a bear's teeth in his throat, and once in a wash of
blood as he brought forth a stillborn cub. He died his first death
when he was only six, as his father's axe crashed through his skull.
<strong>Even that had not been so agonizing as the fire in his guts</strong>, crackling
along his wings, devouring him. When he tried to fly from it, his
terror fanned the flames and made them burn hotter. One moment he had
been soaring above the Wall, his eagle's eyes marking the movements of
the men below. <strong>Then the flames had turned his heart into a blackened
cinder and sent his spirit screaming back into his own skin, and for a
little while he'd gone mad</strong>. Even the memory was enough to make him
shudder.<br><sub>ADWD-Prologue</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or how Bran feels blood in his mouth when his wolf hunts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;They do,&quot; Bran said with sudden certainty. &quot;They dream tree dreams. I
dream of a tree sometimes. A weirwood, like the one in the godswood.
It calls to me. <strong>The wolf dreams are better. I smell things, and
sometimes I can taste the blood</strong>.&quot;<br><sub>ACOK-Bran I</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or how Jon feels hunger felt by his wolf.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it was a hunger inside him, sharp as a dragonglass blade. A hunger...
he could feel it. <strong>It was food he needed, prey, a red deer that stank
of fear or a great elk proud and defiant. He needed to kill and fill
his belly with fresh meat and hot dark blood. His mouth began to water
with the thought</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>It was a long moment before he understood what was happening. When he did, he bolted to his feet. “Ghost?”</strong> He turned toward the wood,
and there he came, padding silently out of the green dusk, the breath
coming warm and white from his open jaws. “Ghost!” he shouted, and the
direwolf broke into a run.<br />
<sub> <em>A Storm Of Swords: Chapter 79</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>White Walkers, like all living things, feel pain. We saw it when Sam stabbed one, the White Shade screamed with pain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do it now. Stop crying and fight, you baby. Fight, craven. It was his
father he heard, it was Alliser Thorne, it was his brother Dickon and
the boy Rast. Craven, craven, craven. He giggled hysterically,
wondering if they would make a wight of him, a huge fat white wight
always tripping over its own dead feet. Do it, Sam. Was that Jon, now?
Jon was dead. You can do it, you can, just do it. And then he was
stumbling forward, falling more than running, really, closing his eyes
and shoving the dagger blindly out before him with both hands. <strong>He
heard a crack, like the sound ice makes when it breaks beneath a man's
foot, and then a screech so shrill and sharp that he went staggering
backward with his hands over his muffled ears</strong>, and fell hard on his
arse.<br><sub> <em>ASOS: Samwell I</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But we do not see White Walkers screaming when their minions are burned or hacked, which means they aren't feeling the pain felt by their <em>skin</em>, which in turn implies they aren't inside the dead skin at all. Or it could be just because their skin is dead, it feels no pain, therefore the Walkers feel no pain.</p>
<h3>So Spake Martin...Er or didn't spake</h3>
<p>George R.R. Martin has however <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1282/"" rel=""noreferrer"">refused to confirm</a> if Others control their minions like Skin-Changers control their skins.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, I asked a bunch of questions that got an &quot;excellent cheese&quot;
response from George, who was at least amused enough by our
observation that he used cheese to change the subject that he went on
to use cheese as the <em>only</em> subject change...</p>
<p>Do The Others warg into the bodies of the dead the same way that wargs
go &quot;into&quot; the bodies of animals?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since Author replied with Cheese, he refused to confirm it but he didn't rule it out either. So it may be possible that George has a similar idea about how their powers work.</p>
<p>So until His Grace GRRM decides to tell us more about it, we do not know for sure.</p>

"168027","How much contact with Dragonglass is needed to destroy a White Walker?","<p>There have been a few questions and comments in our community lately regarding Dragonglass and the need to have weapons (swords, arrowheads etc) made from it to combat the White Walkers.</p>

<p>In Season 3, Episode 8, Samwell kills a White Walker with a dragonglass dagger, by stabbing the Walker in the shoulder. </p>

<p>However what interested me is how deep a wound is needed to destroy a White Walker?  Is a single, shallow cut enough? If so, rather than trying to manufacture arrowheads or spear-points, men could be given slivers of dragonglass and simply throw them at the Walkers, throwing enough will almost certainly cause some wounds.  Manufactured weapons of dragonglass could then be provided to those better trained to use them.</p>

<p>There are a number of pages that talk about dragonglass killing <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Dragonglass"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">White Walkers</a>, there is not (that I can find) any discussion of the degree of wounding needed for this to succeed.</p>

<p>Is there any in-universe lore that gives this detail? </p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","168028","<p>I am only versed in show knowledge so that is where this answer will come from:</p>

<hr>

<h1>It Needs to Penetrate the Skin</h1>

<p>In the scene where Sam stabs a White Walker with the Dragonglass dagger it only penetrates the skin and the effect seems to radiate from that area. See the below:</p>

<p><div class=""youtube-embed""><div>
                <iframe width=""640px"" height=""395px"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/mAfdHNjbYHU?start=0""></iframe>
            </div></div></p>

<p>The both times we see Jon kill a White Walker is with his Valyrian steel sword, Longclaw. However, on both occasions his swipe is so strong his sword effectively goes straight through the White Walker turning it into what appears to be ice shards.</p>

<p><div class=""youtube-embed""><div>
                <iframe width=""640px"" height=""395px"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/fC1dVsTkmSI?start=0""></iframe>
            </div></div></p>

<p>Therefore, it appears that to kill one you only need to penetrate the skin of the White Walker though we only have a few occasions to go on.</p>

<hr>

<p>To back this up with some scenes from the latest episode S07E06. The wight bear is only killed when Jorah stabs it with a Dragonglass dagger:</p>

<p><div class=""youtube-embed""><div>
                <iframe width=""640px"" height=""395px"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oz80SgmrPvU?start=0""></iframe>
            </div></div></p>

<p>Also when the wights are attacking the men trapped on the island it appears the dragon glass weapons seem to just graze over the wights, though this might just be the editing not being good enough to make the attacks look like they are actually hitting.</p>

<p>This can be used as backup evidence that to kill one you only need to penetrate the skin. However, as it is about wights it might be a bit different.</p>

"31746","How is there ice in King's Landing during the summer?","<p>I'm only halfway through Game of Thrones (the book), and when I was reading last night, I got really caught up in the practicalities of this particular issue. From what I've read, this series takes place in a pre-industrialized world (no guns, electricity, <strong>refrigeration</strong>, etc.). Then I read this, on page 250 of the chapter Eddard: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Grand Maester Pycelle is talking to Ned ""...Wine no longer agrees with my digestion, I fear, but I can offer you a cup of <strong>iced milk</strong>, sweetened with honey. I find it most refreshing in this heat.”<br/><br/>
  There was no denying the heat; Ned could feel the silk tunic clinging to his chest. Thick, moist air covered the city like a damp woolen blanket, and the riverside had grown unruly as the poor fled their hot, airless warrens to jostle for sleeping places near the water, where the only breath of wind was to be found. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ned sipped politely at the iced milk. It was pleasantly cold...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So how is this possible? I was under the impression that it took them days to get from The Trident to King's Landing, and even longer to get from Winterfell to The Trident, so it's not like someone can just bring some ice down to the big city when they need it. And without refrigeration they surely can't keep ice frozen for long if it's sweltering outside. </p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","31764","<p>From what I've learned, and knowing that during my grandmother's days, this is how they <em>actually</em> did it, people cut the ice from lakes during winter and stored it packed in hay. I've never heard of anyone climbing mountains to get ice, but then there is a dearth of good ""ice mountains"" in my part of the world.</p>

<p>In my grandmother's days, they took blocks of ice and placed them in cupboards with heavy wooden walls, which thereby became refrigerated. It was a means to make milk and meat and other fresh goods last longer.</p>

<p>Ice can last surprisingly long when packed in insulating material. However, if it could possibly last during multi-year summers, I do not know. Presumably, someone in Westeros has succeeded. </p>

<h2>Tyrion's insecurities</h2>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ViFecm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ViFecm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Tyrion was more than aware of his short-comings. He was born in a family famed for beauty, wealth and strength. He lacked two of them and had wealth only thanks to his father. To make matters even worse, his father was a cold man who had an ideal about what Lannisters should be like, which was perfection. Anyone who didn't meet that ideal was beneath him. And sadly for Tyrion, he didn't quite manage to pass on that criteria. </p>

<p>For the outside world, Tyrion learnt long ago that while cruel words can hurt, it hurts even more to let people know that they got to you. So he was most accomplished at wearing a facade, a mask which didn't let slip that he was hurt by names such as imp etc and other cruel japes. </p>

<p>But that Facade never helped him when he was in front of his father. Whenever his father's piercing gaze was upon him, Tyrion suddenly became hyper-aware of all his short-coming. He could sense how his waddling was embarrassing, how his height was embarrassing, how his mismatched legs were embarrassing, how his mismatched eyes were embarrassing and how he was the very personification of Embarrassment. </p>

<p>That sort of up-bringing crushed his self-esteem but the kindness of his uncles, Aunt and his brother saw him through that and ensured that the poor lad didn't commit suicide. They however could not lift his own sense of self-worth (His uncles did try, for example Gerion Lannister used to make him recite 16 wonders of the world in front of entire West whenever there was a feast, when Tyrion was a child. Tyrion felt very proud of his accomplishments. His aunt Genna, who took up a maternal role for the Lannister orphans after Joanna died, also recognized Tyrion's intelligence and used to favor him instead of Cersei apparently), at least not around his father. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Tyrion's Love Life</h2>

<p>With that done, now we have to discuss the cases of the Women he has been romantically involved with and those who want to be romantically involved with him. </p>

<h3>Tysha</h3>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HB7olm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HB7olm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Tyrion's first and for almost a certainty, only love, comes first. She's the only girl who ever truly and unconditionally loved Tyrion for what he was, Tyrion reciprocated with same if not deeper feelings. </p>

<p>She was an orphan, daughter of a Crofter, on her way to nowhere really as she lost her place when her father died. He met her on road while she was running from two men who were trying to rape her. Jaime chased the men and went back to the Rock to get more help as it offended him that Outlaws would dare strike on innocent travelers this close to the Rock. Tyrion on the other hand escorted Tysha to an inn, fed her and before they knew it, they were sharing a bed. Tyrion recalls that she was very lovely. She was a virgin and by morning, Tyrion was in love with her.</p>

<p>Tyrion married her by bribing a drunk septon. But he was very well aware that his father would never accept a Crofter's daughter as his daughter-in-law, wed to second in line to the throne of the ancient Kings of the Rock. So he found a way but it didn't work out very well. He set her up in a cottage and they played on being husband and wife for few weeks until the Septon he had bribed to marry them told Lord Tywin.</p>

<p>Then Tywin crushed him. He made Jaime confess that he had hired a virgin whore to make a man out of Tyrion. Then he gave her up to his garrison and bid Tyrion watch. Then he had Tyrion take her as well. </p>

<p>Tyrion hated his father for that. It crushed Tyrion, made him think that no normal woman would ever love a creature as hideous as him. It was all for his money, all a ploy. </p>

<p>He was still hurt by it, it's his POV, he thinks that smoke was stinging his eyes when he was retelling the tale to Bronn, when in fact was on verge of crying. </p>

<p>But it all made sense, right? He only had to look at himself. Why would a girl like Tysha want to be with a hideous malformed dwarf like him? He only had his money, yes that's what it was all about. His father was right. She was a gold-digger. </p>

<p>Except that she wasn't. She was just an innocent girl who truly loved Tyrion, who saved her from rapists, made her laugh, reassured her. Lord Tywin forced Jaime to confess that she was a whore, he told him that she only wanted Tyrion's gold so she was no better than a whore. And that Tyrion would thank him in future for getting him rid of this low-born whore. </p>

<p>This belief was cemented even further as he saw his father trying desperately to find a match for him among the nobles. He got so desperate by the end that he even offered to take soiled daughters of minor Lords as his daughter in law. And even they rejected the proposal. </p>

<p>Tyrion was now sure, why would any woman ever want him unless he paid her? So he started seeking solace among whores, as they were the only women who'd ever want to be with him, even if it was just for his gold.</p>

<p>But the ghost of Tysha never left him. It kept haunting him. He kept telling himself he was free of Tysha, yet he never was. Even as he was on brink of death in the aftermath of Battle of Blackwater, he was subconsciously dreaming about the brief happy married life he had with Tysha. </p>

<p>He was never free of her. He always loved her. Whatever hatred he felt towards her turned into enormous guilt as Jaime told him the truth. He had watched his wife getting raped and he actually took a part in the rape.</p>

<p>He went to his father to get the truth. When his father kept referring to her as a whore, he shot him. And now he goes around, wondering, Where do the whores go? So that he could find Tysha again<sup><strong>1</strong></sup>.</p>

<h3>Shae</h3>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WVGeHm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WVGeHm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Shae is another one. While some part of Tyrion always kept telling him that you fool, she is just a whore, he couldn't help but fall for her. </p>

<p>Shae was however only interested in his money. And as soon as Tyrion was arrested on charges of regicide, she went to the camp of the highest bidder, which was Cersei. On promises of a wealth and a good marriage, Shae provided a false testimony in the trial, incriminating both Tyrion and his wife Sansa. </p>

<p>Tyrion was hurt but he knew what she was and he demanded a trial by combat instead. </p>

<h3>Sansa</h3>

<p>Even though Tyrion thought the match was cruel, he agreed to it as he thought it was best to have Walls of Winterfell around him as he had Cersei for an enemy and his own power was dwindling day by day. Especially as Tywin made it clear to him that he would never let Tyrion inherit the Rock.</p>

<p>Tyrion discovered that he actually wanted Sansa, romantically. He wanted her to love him and he wanted to love her. But Sansa was always cold and distant. Tyrion thought if he was kind to her, she might come around. Everyone moves on, right? </p>

<p>That didn't happen. Sansa made it clear to Tyrion while she was willing to obey her Lord husband, she will never want a sexual relation with him out of her own will. That left a bitter taste in his mouth, further reaffirming his earlier conviction that he will never have someone who could love him for what he was. He told her as much, that that's why gods made whores for people like him. </p>

<h3>Penny</h3>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0icnGm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0icnGm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Then there's case of Penny. Another lowborn dwarf girl. Tyrion thinks of her as both ugly and beautiful but by the time he met her, he was very much damaged goods. He was searching for Wherever the whores go, remember? The girl however was innocent and she began to like Tyrion.</p>

<p>Tyrion however failed to return the feelings as he didn't feel that way. But he was never cruel to her, he comforted her and rejected her advances by sympathetically lying that he was saving himself for his wife Sansa even though it's Tysha he is looking for. Lies we tell for love!</p>

<p>But then Shae came to haunt him. Young Penny expressed her sincere admiration for Tyrion, how he was brave. But that reminded him of Shae and her lies. Which enraged him. </p>

<p>Yet Tyrion doesn't hate her. He pities her rather, or feels sympathetic towards her. </p>

<p>Her raw innocent emotion and desire to find love reminds him of his own young self, when he was in love with Tysha. He doesn't want to crush that. </p>

<p>Penny is Tyrion's test. She is innocence, goodness and sincerity. Where as Tyrion now is hate, vengeance and indifference. </p>

<p>He doesn't want to break her heart but he can't find it in him to give her what she wants. He doesn't desire her sexually and he knows full well that she doesn't want him in a lustful way either, she's too innocent for lust yet.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Only time Tyrion was ever capable of loving someone was when he met Tysha. She was the only one and she has always been the one for him even though he kept telling himself otherwise for years until Jaime told him the truth. </p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Does Tyrion have such a low self-esteem?</strong></p>

<p>Yes he does. He has had a rather dim view of his worth ever since he was an ugly child in Casterly Rock. If not for his uncles, Aunt and brother, he probably would have ended his life a lot earlier. He let himself believe that he could be loved when he met Tysha but he was reminded by his father that its not true. He kept believing it till Jaime told him the truth. </p>

<p>His teenage, his youth are formed based on that experience. He had accepted that as his fate. If its his fate to be accepted only by whores, then so be it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Does he simply despise women of lower-classes?</strong></p>

<p>No he doesn't. His only true love is low-born, the one who still haunts him and is driving him mad. He is capable of kindness to them, as he showed kindness to Robert's whores and Penny. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>But why does he so quickly judge them guilty?</strong></p>

<p>Take it case by case.</p>

<p>In case of Tysha, he just had to look at himself. Why would a beautiful girl like her want to be with him? Jaime was kind to him always, it was not out of character for him to hire a whore to make a man out of him. And why would his father lie about it? If he didn't like the marriage, he could just say that. Why would he want to lie? Tyrion had no reason to suspect that it wasn't true and the lie actually made sense to him.</p>

<p>In case of Shae, a woman who on numerous occasions reminded you that she was a whore indeed, lied in court to get you condemned to death presumably on behest of your sister with promises of gold, is now lying naked in your father's bed who just had condemned you to death, calling him My Lion, what other proof do you need to judge her guilty? Did Cersei Threaten to kill her? If she had been threatened, she could just provide a simple testimony, why add the colorful description of their intimate relationship? Why tell about their personal things in the court? And why was she now so happily lying in Tyrion's father's bed? She never cared about him. </p>

<p>In case of Sansa, she again proved he was not someone who could be loved, no matter how hard he tried, no matter what he did, no matter how kind he was. He fought with a King for her honor, fought with his father for her chastity but she wouldn't ever consider letting him touch her, she wouldn't ever confide in him, she wouldn't ever consider him her life partner. And when he was arrested, she was first to fled, betraying her husband. But still Tyrion to defended her in the court as innocent.</p>

<p>In Case of Penny, he is damaged goods. He doesn't desire her. He doesn't want to tarnish her innocence either. But pities her, he sees himself in her but he doesn't love her. Nor does he hate her and would do what he can do to protect her. Goes without saying she is lower class. </p></li>

"168488","Why was Aegon the first Dragonlord to conquer Westeros?","<p>Aegon the Conqueror manage to conquer six of the seven kingdoms, with just three dragons and a small army, with no more than 1600 men, according to this dialogue from <em>A Storm of Swords - Davos V</em> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Power?"" The king snorted. ""I have thirteen hundred men on Dragonstone, another three hundred at Storm's End."" His hand swept over the Painted Table. ""The rest of Westeros is in the hands of my foes. I have no fleet but Salladhor Saan's. No coin to hire sellswords. No prospect of plunder or glory to lure freeriders to my cause.""
  ""Lord husband,"" said Queen Selyse, ""you have more men than Aegon did three hundred years ago. All you lack are dragons.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He only failed to conquer Dorne because they used a guerilla-like strategy, making dragons useless.</p>

<p>But I wonder why Aegon was the first to conquer Westeros. The Valyrian Freehold extended pretty well in Essos, but never attempted to conquer Westeros. </p>

<p>Even if it was for political reasons (too busy with wars, would be too hard to administer, etc.), that does not prevent any Dragonlord conquering Westeros to make his own independent state.</p>

<p>So, why was Aegon the first to conquer Westeros with dragons, when others could have done it before?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","168511","<p>According to <em><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/The_World_of_Ice_%26_Fire"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The World of Ice &amp; Fire</a></em>, Valyrians only established an outpost in Westeros at the location that will be then called Dragonstone before the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Doom_of_Valyria"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Doom</a> hit them:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perhaps in preparation for their crossing of the narrow sea, <strong>the Valyrians also established their westernmost outpost on the isle that would come to be known as Dragonstone</strong> some two hundred years before the Doom.<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice &amp; Fire, <em>The Doom of Valyria</em> chapter</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apparently they were content to keep just this single stronghold without expandig further because their main interests were still in Essos:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Valyria felt its outpost was secured, and the dragonlords thus continued their schemes and intrigues on their native continent.</strong><br>
  And then, unexpected to all (save perhaps Aenar Targaryen and his maiden daughter Daenys the Dreamer), the Doom came to Valyria.<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice &amp; Fire, <em>The Doom of Valyria</em> chapter</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While they were busy with their plans for Essos, the Doom struck, killing all the dragonlords except the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Targaryens</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The dragonlords had been gathered in Valyria as was their wont... except for Aenar Targaryen, his children, and his dragons, who had fled to Dragonstone and so escaped the Doom</strong>.<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice &amp; Fire, <em>The Doom of Valyria</em> chapter</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Twelve years before the Doom of Valyria (114 BC), Aenar Targaryen</strong> sold his holdings in the Freehold and the Lands of the Long Summer and <strong>moved with all his wives, wealth, slaves, dragons, siblings, kin, and children to Dragonstone</strong>, a bleak island citadel beneath a smoking mountain in the narrow sea.<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice &amp; Fire, <em>The Reign of the Dragons: The Conquest</em> chapter</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Targaryens left Valyria before the Doom because of a vision of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daenys_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Aenar's daughter</a> of the imminent destruction of Valirya:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Targaryens were far from the most powerful of the dragonlords, and their rivals saw their flight to Dragonstone as an act of surrender, as cowardice. <strong>But Lord Aenar’s maiden daughter Daenys, known forever afterward as Daenys the Dreamer, had foreseen the destruction of Valyria by fire. And when the Doom came twelve years later, the Targaryens were the only dragonlords to survive.</strong><br>
  <sub>The World of Ice &amp; Fire, <em>The Reign of the Dragons: The Conquest</em> chapter</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even after the Doom, and until the reign of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon_I_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Aegon the Conqueror</a> more than a century after, Targaryens kept looking at Essos as their main sphere of interest:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yet even so, <strong>for the best part of a hundred years after the Doom of Valyria (the rightly named Century of Blood), House Targaryen looked east, not west</strong>, and took little interest in the affairs of Westeros.<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice &amp; Fire, <em>The Reign of the Dragons: The Conquest</em> chapter</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As we have seen, Essos as the main priority for Targaryens was a habit rooted in a more general way on the whole Valyrian culture; more to the point of your question, there are a couple of speculations by <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Maesters"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Maesters</a> living after the Doom that had limited access to Valyrian texts that try to give an answer to this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Barth"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Septon Barth</a> speculated on the matter [of the contacts between Valyrians and the Westerlands], referring to a Valyrian text that has since been lost, <strong>suggesting that the Freehold's sorcerers foretold that the gold of Casterly Rock would destroy them.</strong> <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Perestan"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Archmaester Perestan</a> has put forward a different, more plausible speculation, <strong>suggesting that the Valyrians had in ancient days reached as far as Oldtown but suffered some great reverse or tragedy there that caused them to shun all of Westeros thereafter.</strong><br>
  <sub>The World of Ice &amp; Fire, <em>The Westerlands</em> chapter</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Summarizing, all of this basically explains mostly why were the Targaryens to conquer the Western continent, not why no one did it before, but I think that we can safely assume these things:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Valyrian_Freehold"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Valyrians</a> were most interested in the lands of Essos, where resided the most ancient and most refined civilizations (like Ancient Greece and Rome), instead of the rather uncivilized Westeros (comparable, I think, to the pre-feudal germanic kingdoms), that evidently was not a priority: they conquered a large part of the East, but only established a single stronghold in the West (Dragonstone).</li>
<li>Probably the Valyrians planned to conquer Westeros later, when they thought that their business in Essos was completed, but at some point the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Doom_of_Valyria"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Doom</a> occured, and they suddenly stopped to plan conquests. Or to do anything else.</li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aenar_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Aenar Targaryen</a> and his family were already on Dragonstone, so they escaped the Doom, but even then, the priority resided in the East (the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Century_of_Blood"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wars between the Free Cities</a> that suddenly were free from Valyrian rule).</li>
<li>When <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon_I_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Aegon Targaryen</a> finally took interest in the West, there were no other Valyrian Dragonlords that could beat him on this race to <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon%27s_Conquest"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">conquest</a> it: so it was extremely easy for him to be the first one.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Like I said, this mostly explain why Aegon was the first Dragonlord to conquer Westeros, not why nobody preceded him.</em></p>

<p>We also have two possible theories, that are in themselves just mere speculations, that try to answer why the conquer of Westeros was not a priority for Valyria:</p>

<ul>
<li>The most mythological one tells that they believed in a prophecy that viewed Westeros as the source of their future destruction.</li>
<li>Another most rational view was that they somehow encountered great difficulties in their exploration of Westeros that made them consider that it wasn't worth the effort.</li>
</ul>

<p>But it should be noted that this general indifference towards Westeros was not an strict rule or a self-imposed limitation for all Valyrians: we know that some minor families like the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Velaryon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Velaryon</a> and the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Celtigar"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Celtigar</a> (that were not Dragonlord families) had settled on Westeros, always near Dragonstone, even before the Targaryen's own flight from Valyria.</p>

<p>Back to your question </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, why was Aegon the first to conquer Westeros with dragons, when others could have done it before?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that the simplest and truest answer is that<br>
<strong>Others could have done it before, but no one actually did it because they were not interested, so he was the one to do it</strong>;<br>
or, in other words<br>
<strong>No one did it first because no one did it first</strong>.</p>

"168551","Did Mirri Maz Dur tell Dany she can't get pregnant in the show?","<p>Ok, there's a very well known part of the story in the books canon where <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Mirri_Maz_Duur"" rel=""noreferrer"">Mirri Maz Dur</a> tells <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daenerys_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Daenerys</a> that she is now barren, or at least that's how Dany interprets Mirri's line:</p>

<p>Now in the show, <em>Game of Thrones</em>, Dany tells Jon Snow (in the episode <em>The Dragon and the Wolf</em>) that she can't get pregnant, to which Jon says ""challenge accepted"".</p>

<p>The problem is that I don't recall Mirri actually saying the pregnant part to Dany on the show, so <strong>Did Mirri Maz Dur tell Dany she can't have children on the show?</strong> If so, when/where?</p>

<p>If not, then it's time for another question.</p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","168555","<p>She didn't tell her in the show.</p>

<p>We are not alone in spotting that. New York Times <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/watching/daenerys-targaryen-dragons.html?mcubz=3"" rel=""noreferrer"">pointed it out as well</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When Dany confronts Mirri in the show about Drogo’s condition and asks
  when her Khal will be as he was before, the healer-witch responds with
  a poetic version of “never”: “When the sun rises in the west and sets
  in the east. When the seas go dry and the mountains blow in the wind
  like leaves.” <strong>In the books, she adds one more line, the most crucial
  line in this fertility crisis: “When your womb quickens again, and you
  bear a living child.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Business Insider <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/game-of-thrones-is-daenerys-infertile-barren-mother-dragons-2017-8"" rel=""noreferrer"">also spotted the hole</a>:</p>

  like leaves.""</p>
  
  <p>However, <strong>""Game of Thrones"" omitted a significant portion of Duur's
  warning.</strong> Here's what she said in the books:</p>
  
  <p>When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east When the seas go

  <strong>When your womb quickens again and you bear a living child Then he will return, and not before.</strong></p>

<p>As of now it appears that Show-Runners deliberately chose to omit that line in Season 1, probably planning on getting her pregnant and then they forgot all about it in Season 7. </p>

  <p> The travel of Quentyn Martell to meet Daenerys Targaryen with the objective of setting up an alliance and, maybe, establishing it by marriage. Sadly, his journey is suddenly stopped when one of Daenerys' dragons burns him to ashes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, after reading the book it felt quite strange for me that Martin had dedicated so many book pages to a story, apparently, without real impact on the big picture. </p>

<p>But speaking of it recently with my girlfriend (who is quite a visionary I must say), she stated that the reason is that Quentyn's story is one narrative arc that fulfills one of the Mirri Maz Duur's prophecy about the future children of Daenerys, the part that states ""When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east"".</p>

<p>I was quite shocked by the revelation, as to my understanding it fits quite well on the prophecy and explains why so many pages to start and end an inoffensive story arc, but I wonder if there is some other clue or point in the novels that can confirm this theory.</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","168563","<p>As per the Fan theory your Girlfriend is referring to, yes, Quentyn is the sun which set in the East.</p>
<p>Mirri's prophecy was:</p>

rises in the west and sets in the east,&quot; said Mirri Maz Duur, &quot;When
the seas go dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves. When
your womb quickens again, and you bear a living child. Then he will
return, and not before.&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>AGOT - Daenerys IX</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So for Drogo to return:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sun has to rise in the West and set in the East.</li>
<li>Seas have to go dry</li>
<li>Mountains have to blow in the wind</li>
<li>Daenerys has to give birth to a living child</li>
</ol>
<p>The fan theory is, that the prophecy has been fulfilled for following reasons.</p>
<h3>When the Sun rises in the West and sets in the East</h3>
<p>Quentyn Martell belongs to House Martell whose sigil is Sun pierced by a spear. He was born in Dorne, Westeros and died in Meereen, Essos. So <em>The Sun</em> rose in the West and set in the East.</p>
<p>From <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/Prophecies/Entry/1799"" rel=""noreferrer"">the Citadel</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider that Quentyn Martell -- &quot;the Sun's son&quot;, referring to the
Martell sun -- journeyed from the west to the east, where he died</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>When the Seas go dry</h3>
<p>The Sea that went dry was the Dothraki sea. Daenerys noted that the grass of the Dothraki sea had gone dry.</p>
<p>From <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/Prophecies/Entry/1799"" rel=""noreferrer"">the Citadel</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Daenerys's last chapter she notes that the Dothraki sea is going
dry and the grasses are dying</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And also:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dany set off through the tall grass at a brisk pace. The earth felt
warm between her toes. The grass was as tall as she was. It never
seemed so high when I was mounted on my silver, riding beside my
sun-and-stars at the head of his khalasar. As she walked, she tapped
her thigh with the pitmaster's whip. That, and the rags on her back,
were all she had taken from Meereen.</p>
<p>Though <strong>she walked through a green kingdom, it was not the deep rich
green of summer. Even here autumn made its presence felt, and winter
would not be far behind. The grass was paler than she remembered, a
wan and sickly green on the verge of going yellow. After that would
come brown. The grass was dying</strong>.<br><sub><em><strong>ADWD - Daenerys X</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The next morning she woke stiff and sore and aching, with ants
crawling on her arms and legs and face. When she realized what they
were, she kicked aside the stalks of <strong>dry brown grass</strong> that had
served as her bed and blanket and struggled to her feet.<br><sub><em><strong>ADWD - Daenerys X</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>And mountains blow in the wind like leaves</h3>
<p>The mountains that blew like leaves are the tricky part.</p>
<p>From <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/Prophecies/Entry/1799"" rel=""noreferrer"">the Citadel</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two of the pyramids of Meereen collapse in smoke and ash following
Viserion and Rhaegel rampaging through the city and that she
menstruates</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But from <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/3zece8/spoilers_all_mirri_maz_duurs_prophecy_has_been/"" rel=""noreferrer"">a fan theory</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now the most confusing aspect of the prophesy (my theory for which is
kinda tinfoily so bear with me). ‘<strong>The mountains blow in the wind
like leaves’ does not refer to the destruction of Meeren or any form
of volcanic eruption but to Ser Robert Strong</strong>. It is widely believed
that Ser Robert Strong is Gregor Clegane (aka the mountain)’s
reanimated corpse. <strong>It is however noted that Gregor's head was
shipped to Dorne. This decapitation would mean that the one “mountain”
has now become two “mountains”</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd like to add that since Mountain's body is in King's Landing and his head is in Dorne, One could say that of the two Mountains, one has blown like leaves to Dorne. Citadel however points to destruction of Pyramids.</p>
<p>An alternative view is the one suggested by <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/85108/joao-duarte"">Joao Duarte</a> in the comments, If somehow the Wall is brought down, it could also be something akin to Mountains blowing in the wind like leaves.</p>
<h3>OMG IF DANY CAN HAVE BABIES THEN DROGO WILL RETURN?</h3>
<p>We must note what <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/Prophecies/Entry/1799"" rel=""noreferrer"">the Citadel says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This might be a real prophecy, or it may simply be a sort of curse to
strike terror and despair into Daenerys's heart.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And also:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This of course leaves us the need for a living child, and then the
&quot;return&quot; of Drogo... though our speculation is that if she has a
child, it will be a son that she names Drogo, thereby fulfilling
Mirri's claim.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is also speculation that Daenerys <em>bleeds</em> (Menstruate) for the first time in months when she is lost in the Dothraki sea, Which means she may have miscarried a child.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just past midday she came upon a bush growing by the stream, its
twisted limbs covered with <strong>hard green berries</strong>. Dany squinted at
them suspiciously, then <strong>plucked one from a branch and nibbled at
it</strong>. Its flesh was tart and chewy, with a bitter aftertaste that
seemed familiar to her. &quot;In the khalasar, they used berries like these
to flavor roasts,&quot; she decided. Saying it aloud made her more certain
of it. Her belly rumbled, and <strong>Dany found herself picking berries
with both hands and tossing them into her mouth</strong>.<br><sub><em><strong>ADWD - Daenerys X</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>When she woke, gasping, her thighs were slick with blood</strong>.</p>
<p>For a moment she did not realize what it was. The world had just begun
to lighten, and the tall grass rustled softly in the wind. No, please,
let me sleep some more. I'm so tired. She tried to burrow back beneath
the pile of grass she had torn up when she went to sleep. Some of the

<p>Now, we know that Commander Mormont knew that the White Walkers were alive and kicking, since he knew what Craster did to his sons (he confirms this in <em>What is Dead May Never Die</em>). I can't think of any scene where he dismisses the idea of the White Walkers existing, but he certainly never mentions anything about the existence of the White Walkers. None of the men of the Night's Watch seem to believe in the White Walkers (when they let the wights in, and the numerous times when Sam talks about them).</p>

"32314","Are Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark the parents of Jon Snow?","<p>At the tourney at Harrenhal in the year of the false spring, Rhaegar won the jousting contest. But instead of crowning his own wife Elia the queen of love and beauty, he crowned Lyanna.</p>

<p>It seems that Lyanna did not truly love Robert, and Rhaegar was not the evil man who Robert made him out to be.</p>

<p>In this two quotes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yet sometimes Dany would picture it the way it had been...Her brother
  Rhaegar battling the Usurper in the bloody waters of the Trident and
  dying for the woman he loved...</p>

<p>GRRM avoids using the word ‘Elia’ and instead uses ‘the woman’ or ‘the woman he loved’ suggesting that it could be someone besides Elia... Lyanna, perhaps?</p>

<p>When Eddard went to the Tower of Joy to save Lyanna, there were three men of the Kingsguard (Ser Arthur Dayne, Ser Gerold Hightower, and Ser Oswell Whent). This is curious since, as far as the reader knows, there is no royal blood present at the Tower of Joy, just Lyanna. Then why are they there, instead of with Viserys or Daenerys?

<p>It's worth noting the only person who holds any grudge against Rhaegar is Robert who is obviously biased. Eddard certainly doesn't hate Rhaegar so it seems he didn't rape Lyanna.</p>

<p>Lyanna is mentioned to have loved the winter rose and it's a laurel of these Rhaegar leaves in her lap. This is suggestive in itself. Also, Dany in the house of the undying sees a vision in which a blue rose grows out of the wall. This is almost certainly Jon Snow.</p>

<p>I would conclude that Lyanna and Rhaegar are the most likely parents as of yet. Of course George could always write it to be something else but at this time the evidence is overwhelming. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I doubt very much that Tywin meant anything by naming his child Tyrion. It is hinted that Mad Aerys might have fathered Tyrion, and it is common knowledge that Tywin despised Tyrion, but I have a hard time seeing his name being relevant for any of these things. – TLP</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What hints exist, in either the show or the books, that suggest that Tyrion may have been a royal bastard?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","33768","<p>The theory that Tyrion is the son of Aerys II Targaryen mainly stems from two passages in the books:</p>

<p>First, in <em>A Storm of Swords</em> (Book 3) Tywin says this to Tyrion as a rebuke when the latter claims succession to Casterly Rock (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> ""Men's law give you the right to bear my name and display my colors,
 since <strong>I cannot prove that you are not mine.</strong>""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This passage has also made it's way to the TV series (episode 1, season 3). </p>

<p>Second, in <em>A Dance with Dragons</em> (Book 5) Ser Barristan tells the following story to Dany about her father, Aerys II (again emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> ""Prince Aerys... as a youth, he was taken with a certain lady of
 Casterly Rock, a cousin of Tywin Lannister. When she and Tywin wed,
 your father drank too much wine at the wedding feast and was heard to
 say that it was a great pity that the lord's right to the first night
 had been abolished. A drunken jape, no more, but Tywin Lannister was
 not a man to forget such words, or the ... <strong>liberties your father
 took during the bedding.</strong>""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a few other more subtle indications that some have taken as support for this theory: Tyrion's fascination with dragons, his odd hair coloration (pale blonde as opposed to the golden blonde the Lannisters are famous for), and narratively the fact that he seems to be on his way to unite with Dany.</p>

<p>However, there are several problems with this theory. Tywin's hatred of Tyrion can be easily attributable to the latter causing his mother's death during birth. Something Cersei holds against Tyrion as well. Doubting Tyrion's paternity could very well be Tywin lashing out at his son out of grief, since by all accounts Tywin was deeply in love with Joanna, and he isn't exactly the forgiving type.</p>

<p>The account of Aerys taking liberties with Joanna is also not without problems for this theory. </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Barristan's story indicates that Aerys did <em>something</em> objectionable
 during the <em>bedding</em>. In Westerosi culture, the bedding is the name
 given to the <em>first</em> time a husband lies with his bride (sometimes
 witnessed by the feast's guests who have had too much to drink). So if
 anything, this story casts doubt on the paternity of Joanna's first
 born: Jaime and Cersei, not Tyrion.
 
 Sure, Aerys may have raped or seduced Joanna at a later date, but
 apart from his known lust for her we have no evidence of this ever
 happening.</p>

<p><sub>1. Assuming that she did know about the death of the first-born son of Rhaegar Targaryan (also named Aegon Targaryan), it would adequately explain why she named her son Aegon as well in my mind...</sub></p>

<p><strong>Edit for clarity:</strong></p>

<p>I am aware of the FAegon story-line from the books, and it looks like that story-line has probably been dropped from the show (although who knows? Maybe Cercei's Golden Company will end up being led by FAegon in season 8... What a twist!). Even so, if there are book passages which lend credence to the theory that Lyanna Stark knew of the death of Rhaegar's children, that's more than good enough for me.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","168637","<p>We certainly know that since the fall of King's Landing, the siege of Storm's End was lifted by Ned Stark (evidence in following quote soon). Ned went to Storm's End after arguing with Robert Baratheon over the killing of Rhaegar's children. We can assume that news of the fall of King's Landing was flowing across the realm in the meantime (ravens, refugees, people, etc.). Certainly the new King would be informing Lords at castles, either to celebrate victory, or demand the bending of the knee.</p>
<p>The Tower of Joy is near Nightsong and Kingsgrave. Kingsgrave is the seat of House Manwoody. Nightsong is the seat of House Caron. Castles such as this would be the source of supplies, and news. As long as we assume the airspeed velocity of a laden raven is greater than that an army (or a band of 7 people on horseback), it is certainly possible for news to have reached the Tower of Joy with the events of King's Landing.</p>

<p>“When King’s Landing fell, Ser Jaime slew your king with a golden sword, and I wondered where you were.”</p>
<p>“Far away,” Ser Gerold said, “or Aerys would yet sit the Iron Throne, and our false brother would burn in seven hells.”</p>
<p>“I came down on Storm’s End to lift the siege,” Ned told them, “and the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne dipped their banners, and all their knights bent the knee to pledge us fealty. I was certain you would be among them.”</p>
<p>”Our knees do not bend easily,” said Ser Arthur Dayne.</p>

<p>“Then, or now,” said Ser Arthur. He donned his helm.</p>
<p>”We swore a vow,” explained old Ser Gerold.</p>
<p>Ned’s wraiths moved up beside him, shadow swords in their hands. They were seven against three. “And now it begins,” said Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. He unsheathed Dawn and held it with both hands. The blade was pale as milkglass, alive with light.</p>
<p>“No,” said Ned with sadness in his voice. “Now it ends.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Kingsguard are clearly aware of the fall of King's Landing. Although to be fair, they only respond of that knowledge after Ned Stark's first comment regarding King's Landing's fall, and Jaime Lannister's betrayal. They don't betray any knowledge aside from that already mentioned by Ned Stark. So as far as actual proof whether Lyanna Stark knew of the specific events of Aegon's fate, is unclear.</p>
<p>That said, there is also no book evidence that Lyanna Stark named her son Aegon, or would have in any way done something with the knowledge of the death of Aegon Targaryen in King's Landing. It is entirely possible that a show writer figured Aegon was a cool name, and a cool reference to the removed storyline of Aegon Targaryen in the books, without thinking of the implications.</p>

<p>[Bran]:&quot;Was there one who was best of all?&quot;<br />
[Ned]: &quot;The finest knight I ever saw was Ser Arthur Dayne, who fought with a blade called Dawn, forged from the heart of a fallen star. They called him the Sword of the Morning, and he would have killed me [at the Tower of Joy] but for Howland Reed.&quot;.<br />
<sub><em>-A Song of Ice and Fire: Book One - A Game of Thrones, Chapter Twenty-One (<a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Clash_of_Kings-Chapter_21"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bran III</a>).</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
A Caveat on being the 'best': George R. R. Martin is intelligent enough to realise that there is no real 'best' swordsman, or at least not one that is the best by far. So here, we're only talking about reputation. In fact, he goes on to say:
<blockquote>
<p>[Interviewer]: Who would win in a fight, Barristan Selmy or Arthur Dayne (in their best days)?<br />
[Martin]: Dayne... if he was armed with Dawn.<br />
If both men had equivalent weaponry, it might be a toss-up.<br />
-So Spake Martin: <em><a href=""https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/The_Sword_of_the_Morning_vs._Barristan_the_Bold"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">THE SWORD OF THE MORNING VS. BARRISTAN THE BOLD</a></em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that also informs of the importance of the tools that the swordsman uses, Arthur had the advantage of having literally the best sword in all of Westeros, <strong><a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dawn"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dawn</a></strong>.

"168638","Does Cersei have any friends?","<p>I'm looking for canon (both <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> and <em>Game of Thrones</em>) examples of genuine friendship between Cersei and another character. I am not talking about the love/lust she feels for Jaime or the motherly love she showed toward her children. I also am not talking about the lackie/servant dynamic with her most frequent hangout buddies Qyburn and Sir Gregor. Are there examples of friendship at any point in her life?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","168641","<p>There is at least one character who Cersei considers to be her friend: <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Taena_of_Myr"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lady Taena Merryweather</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Lord Merryweather and I wish only to serve Your Grace and the little king,&quot; the woman purred, with a look that was as pregnant as Lady Graceford.</p>
<p>This one is ambitious, and her lord is proud but poor. <strong>&quot;We must speak again, my lady. Taena, is it? You are most kind. I know that we shall be great friends.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I am growing very fond of Lady Taena. She amuses me.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;My queen?&quot; said Taena Merryweather. &quot;You have a strange look in your eyes. Are you unwell?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was just . . . remembering.&quot; Her throat was dry. <strong>&quot;You are a good friend, Taena. I have not had a true friend in . . .&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, he has a strong wife. It was a pity Taena could not serve as Hand. She was thrice the man her husband was, and far more amusing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Throughout <em>A Feast for Crows</em> Taena serves as Cersei's close ally, confidant, and even informant. Cersei considers her to be the only person she can truly trust and rely upon. This is particularly remarkable given that Cersei knows that Taena is spying on her for Lady Margery Tyrell--a situation that Cersei not only allows to continue, but tries to twist to her advantage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If you know she is a spy, why take her on?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Margaery is not half so clever as she thinks. She has no notion what a sweet serpent she has in that Myrish slut. I use Taena to feed the little queen what I want her to know. Some of it is even true.&quot; Cersei's eyes were bright with mischief. &quot;And Taena tells me everything Maid Margaery is doing.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At one point Cersei even makes sexual advances upon her, but despite Taena's apparent willingness to &quot;serve her Queen&quot; this aspect of their relationship is limited to a single night.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was still no good.</p>
<p>It had never been any good with anyone but Jaime.</p>
<p>When she tried to take her hand away, Taena caught it and kissed her fingers. &quot;Sweet queen, how shall I pleasure you?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally I believe their &quot;friendship&quot; was very one-sided, with Taena in fact expertly <em>manipulating</em> her way into Cersei's good graces. We have no idea how she really feels about her Queen, considering how abysmal a judge of character Cersei proves herself to be. Taena has yet to reappear in the books following her flight from King's Landing during Cersei's imprisonment by the Faith.</p>

"168645","Why didn't Tyrion have Littlefinger arrested?","<p>Lord Petyr Baelish tells Catelyn Stark that the Valyrian steel dagger is Tyrion's, thus getting him arrested. I don't think Tyrion Lannister would have really appreciated his little journey to the Vale. So, why did he do nothing against Littlefinger once he returned to King's Landing?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","168647","<p><strong>Short answer : he wanted to but he couldn't</strong></p>

<p><strong>Long answer :</strong></p>

<p>Petyr Baelish was quite powerful in King's Landing, and once Tyrion got more influence, Littlefinger became Lord of Harrenhal and went to the Vale, so too powerful and too far from the influence of Tyrion.</p>

<p>He really didn't appreciate his journey in the Vale, but didn't know how to confront Littlefinger : </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Indeed."" Jowly, balding Janos Slynt looked rather like a frog, a smug frog who had gotten rather above himself. ""We have sore need of you, my lord. Rebellion everywhere, this grim omen in the sky, rioting in the city streets . . ."" <br>
  ""And whose fault is that, Lord Janos?"" Cersei lashed out. ""Your gold cloaks are charged with keeping order. As to you, Tyrion, you could better serve us on the field of battle.""<br>
  He laughed. ""No, I'm done with fields of battle, thank you. I sit a chair better than a horse, and I'd sooner hold a wine goblet than a battle-axe. All that about the thunder of the drums, sunlight flashing on armor, magnificent destriers snorting and prancing? Well, the drums gave me headaches, the sunlight flashing on my armor cooked me up like a harvest day goose, and those magnificent destriers shit everywhere. Not that I am complaining. Compared to the hospitality I enjoyed in the Vale of Arryn, drums, horseshit, and fly bites are my favorite things.""<br>
  Littlefinger laughed. ""Well said, Lannister. A man after my own heart.""<br>
  Tyrion smiled at him, remembering a certain dagger with a dragonbone hilt and a Valyrian steel blade. We must have a talk about that, and soon. He wondered if Lord Petyr would find that subject amusing as well. <br /><sub>-<em>A Clash of Kings - Tyrion I</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later, both have an interesting dialogue</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""That's a handsome knife as well.""
  ""Is it?"" There was mischief in Littlefinger's eyes. He drew the knife and glanced at it casually, as if he had never seen it before. ""Valyrian steel, and a dragonbone hilt. A trifle plain, though. It's yours, if you would like it.""
  ""Mine?"" Tyrion gave him a long look. ""No. I think not. Never mine."" He knows, the insolent wretch. He knows and he knows that I know, and he thinks that I cannot touch him.. <br /><sub>-<em>A Clash of Kings - Tyrion IV</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, this quote resumes Tyrion's thought about harming Littlefinger</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No one had ever thought to question the appointments, and why should they? Littlefinger was no threat to anyone. A clever, smiling, genial man, everyone's friend, always able to find whatever gold the king or his Hand required, and yet of such undistinguished birth, one step up from a hedge knight, he was not a man to fear. He had no banners to call, no army of retainers, no great stronghold, no holdings to speak of, no prospects of a great marriage.
  But do I dare touch him? Tyrion wondered. Even if he is a traitor? He was not at all certain he could, least of all now, while the war raged. Given time, he could replace Littlefinger's men with his own in key positions, but . . . <br /><sub>-<em>A Clash of Kings - Tyrion IV</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keep in mind that Tyrion was not powerful in King's Landing, and they are preparing for war against Stannis : Littlefinger even leaves King's Landing o negotiate a Lannister-Tyrell alliance, and returns only for the battle of the Blackwater. Tyrion was injured in the battle, and he takes few weeks to recover. After that, Littlefinger becomes Lord of Harrenhal, and goes to the Vale, where Tyrion could do nothing to Littlefinger.</p>

<p>To summarize: </p>

<ul>
<li>He understands that Littlefinger is much more powerful and dangerous than he thought</li>
<li>He decides to replace Littlefinger's men with his own men, a strategy for the long term</li>
<li>They don't spend a lot of time together in King's Landing</li>
<li>Petyr is out of reach of Tyrion's power before Tyrion got enough power to do anything</li>
</ul>

"168653","What kind of relationship did Aerys II and Rhaegar Targaryen have?","<p>Having not read the books, I'd be interested to know of any references that detail how the two felt about each other.</p>

<p>From everything I've learned about both characters, they seem to have moral values and personalities that don't jibe. It's also true that Rhaegar's actions led to the downfall of Aerys' reign, and almost the end of the Targaryen dynasty.</p>

<p>What was their relationship with each other? What did Rhaegar think of his father and Aerys II think of his son? What did Rhaegar think about his father's choices? What did Aerys II think of Rhaegar ""kidnapping"" and going on an escapade with Lyanna Stark?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","168665","<p>The relationship between Aerys II and Rhaegar worsened paralleling his growing madness and paranoia. He became suspicious and distrusting of everyone, including his own son Rhaegar, that he suspected to be plotting against him to take the throne.</p>

<hr>

<p>According to <em><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/The_World_of_Ice_%26_Fire"" rel=""noreferrer"">The World of Ice &amp; Fire</a></em>, Aerys II completely lost his sanity after the events called <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Defiance_of_Duskendale"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Defiance of Duskendale</a>, when he was held prisoner by House Darklyn</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Captivity at Duskendale had shattered whatever sanity had remained to Aerys II Targaryen. From that day forth, the king’s madness reigned unchecked, growing worse with every passing year.<br>
  [...]<br>
  Once safely returned to King’s Landing, His Grace refused to leave the Red Keep for any cause and remained a virtual prisoner in his own castle for the next four years, during which time he grew ever more wary of those around him, Tywin Lannister in particular. <strong>His suspicions extended even to his own son and heir. Prince Rhaegar, he was convinced, had conspired with Tywin Lannister to have him slain at Duskendale. They had planned to storm the town walls so that Lord Darklyn would put him to death, opening the way for Rhaegar to mount the Iron Throne and marry Lord Tywin’s daughter</strong>.<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice &amp; Fire, <em>The Targaryen Kings. Aerys II</em> chapter</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another episode that set them apart was the wedding between Rhagar and Elia Martell, that Aerys did not attend, for fear of being assassinated</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Meanwhile, <strong>King Aerys was becoming ever more estranged from his own son and heir</strong>. Early in the year 279 AC, Rhaegar Targaryen, Prince of Dragonstone, was formally betrothed to Princess Elia Martell, the delicate young sister of Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne. They were wed the following year, in a lavish ceremony at the Great Sept of Baelor in King’s Landing, but Aerys II did not attend. <strong>He told the small council that he feared an attempt upon his life if he left the confines of the Red Keep, even with his Kingsguard to protect him</strong>. Nor would he allow his younger son, Viserys, to attend his brother’s wedding.<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice &amp; Fire, <em>The Targaryen Kings. Aerys II</em> chapter</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But probably the event that made evident to everyone their damaged relationship was the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tourney_at_Harrenhal"" rel=""noreferrer"">Great Tourney at Harrenhal</a>, one of the most important events of recent Westerosi history, whose consequences shaped basically everything that happened since then. The court was already divided into factions supporting either Aerys II or Rhaegar, and Rhaegar was believed to be the real responsible for the tourney, that he used as a mean to gather like-minded nobles to deal with the issue of the madness of his worsening father.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>His lordship [Lord Whent] lacked the funds to pay such munificent prizes, they argued; someone else must surely have stood behind him, someone who did not lack for gold but preferred to remain in the shadows whilst allowing the Lord of Harrenhal to claim the glory for hosting this magnificent event. We have no shred of evidence that such a “shadow host” ever existed, but the notion was widely believed at the time and remains so today.<br>
  But if indeed there was a shadow, who was he, and why did he choose to keep his role a secret? A dozen names have been put forward over the years, but only one seems truly compelling: Rhaegar Targaryen, Prince of Dragonstone.<br>
  [...]<br>
  <strong>The prince, it is said, had no interest in the tourney as a tourney; his intent was to gather the great lords of the realm together in what amounted to an informal Great Council, in order to discuss ways and means of dealing with the madness of his father, King Aerys II, possibly by means of a regency or a forced abdication</strong>.<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice &amp; Fire, <em>The Fall of the Dragons. The Year of the False Spring</em> chapter</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The victory of the Tourney by Rhaegar also contributed to raise the suspicions of the King</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Prince Rhaegar emerged as the ultimate victor at the end of the competition. The crown prince, who did not normally compete in tourneys, surprised all by donning his armor and defeating every foe he faced, including four knights of the Kingsguard. In the final tilt, he unhorsed Ser Barristan Selmy, generally regarded as the finest lance in all the Seven Kingdoms, to win the champion’s laurels.<br>
  The cheers of the crowd were said to be deafening, but King Aerys did not join them. <strong>Far from being proud and pleased by his heir’s skill at arms, His Grace saw it as a threat. Lords Chelsted and Staunton inflamed his suspicions further, declaring that Prince Rhaegar had entered the lists to curry favor with the commons and remind the assembled lords that he was a puissant warrior, a true heir to Aegon the Conqueror</strong>.<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice &amp; Fire, <em>The Fall of the Dragons. The Year of the False Spring</em> chapter</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As we know, the Tourney at Harrenhal set in motion all the event that lead to <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Robert%27s_Rebellion"" rel=""noreferrer"">Robert's Rebellion</a> and the end of the rule of House Targaryen, so from that point on, Aerys II and Rhaegar had to worry more about their external enemies rather than furthering their own plans about each other. In the end, their bad relationship ended with their own lives.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Summarizing, we can say that Aerys II and Rhaegar had a bad relationship that originated from the King's madness, and that kept worsening in parallel to the worsening of the monarch's conditions. The factions of the nobles that were behind both of them, and that had something to gain from the prominence of one of the other, also were a factor in making their bad relationship even more bitter and uneasy.</strong></p>

<p>But in the books sometimes are used the term <em>warg</em> to refer a skinchanger that controls other animals (such a hawk and a shadowcat by one of Mance's guards).</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","32374","<p>I think ""<em>Warg</em>"" is just a synonym or subgroup to ""<em>skinchanger</em>"" in this case.

"238508","Did Lyanna Stark ever love Robert Baratheon?","<p>At the time of the famed tourney of Harrenhall, Lady Lyanna Stark was betrothed to Eddard Stark's best friend, Lord Robert Baratheon, while Prince Rhaegar Targaryen was married to Princess Elia Martell of Dorne. Rhaegar eventually won the tourney and the right to name the tourney's queen of love and beauty. Tradition required him to name his wife to the title, but instead he gave the title to Lyanna Stark causing a great scandal. Sometime later Lyanna is spirited away by Rhaegar, an event that would eventually spark the Baratheon/Stark rebellion against the Targaryens.</p>
<p>It is heavily hinted by several characters that Rhaegar and Lyanna shared a mutual attraction, and that the two of them eventually eloped.</p>
<p>Lyanna Stark could have been betrothed by her father, Rickard Stark, to Robert Baratheon <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/169133/did-lyannas-consent-even-matter"">against her wishes</a> and then rebelled against her father's decision by choosing a man more to her liking. Or maybe she was attracted to Robert Baratheon, but then switched allegiance to Rhaegar Targaryen.</p>
<p><strong>Did Lyanna Stark ever love (or was attracted to or even interested in) Robert Baratheon?</strong></p>
<p>Please provide answers from the books, but if the books don't answer that, I would accept answers based on the TV series.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","238510","<p><strong>Probably Not.</strong></p>
<p>We do not hear much of Lyanna's side of things because... well... she is dead. Most of the information we get about her is from Robert or Ned. Obviously Robert is not a reliable source of information and Ned is haunted by the promise he made to her.</p>
<p>The only insight we have is one of Ned's memories when he is tracking down Robert's bastards...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Robert will never keep to one bed,&quot; Lyanna had told him at Winterfell, on the night long ago when their father had promised her hand to the young Lord of Storm's End. &quot;I hear he has gotten a child on some girl in the Vale.&quot; Ned had held the babe in his arms; he could scarcely deny her, nor would he lie to his sister, but he had assured her that what Robert did before their betrothal was of no matter, that he was a good man and true who would love her with all his heart. Lyanna had only smiled. &quot;Love is sweet, dearest Ned, but it cannot change a man's nature.&quot;</p>
<p><sup>A Game of Thrones - Eddard IX</sup></p>

<p>A small point of clarification first... a warg is a subset of skin-changer, one who can control wolves or dogs. So, all wargs are skin-changers, but not all skin-changers are wargs. </p>

<p>Skin-changing is rare and is said ""One man in a thousand is born a skin-changer"". Even untrained skin-changer can enter the an animal subconsciously a particularly strong bond exists between man and animal (e.g. the Stark children and their dire wolves).</p>

<p>Since Ned is a POV character in the books we are able to see his inner thoughts. We never see the ""wolf dreams"" that Bran, Jon, and Arya are all shown to have. Granted, Ned has never had a faithful animal companion like his children have, however since Ned is older it stands to reason that if he had had any signs of skin-changing he would have mentioned it.</p>

<p>This answer uses an out of universe information about how trial by combat works, but I think it may give some idea.</p>

<p>Trial by combat is a way to determine the guilt, not if the accused can walk free even if he was guilty.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_by_combat"" rel=""noreferrer"">Trial by combat</a> was a method to settle accusations in the absence of witnesses or a confession in which two parties in dispute fought in single combat; the winner of the fight was proclaimed to be right. In essence, it was a judicially sanctioned duel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we applied this to the show, we'll see it matches. </p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>In both Tyrion's trials, no one knew for sure if he was guilty or not, so he was able to demand it.</li>
</ul>

<p>In other cases when there was enough evidence:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Jon executing Ser Alliser: Ser Alliser Thorne couldn't because the ruler (Jon) was certain of his guilt. </p></li>
<li><p>The same when Rob executed Rickard Karstark. </p></li>
<li><p>The same when Ned sentenced The Mountain to death, he listened to the villager testimony and because he believed it, he passed the sentence.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Someone like The Mountain can't just go around killing people then demand a trial by combat every time, as long there are witnesses, confession or a way to make the ruler certain of the guilt, he'll pass the sentence and the accused can't demand a trial by combat.</p>

<p>The ruler in this case was Sansa, if she witnessed the crime herself, or believed Bran, she can just pass the sentence.</p>

"32526","Is archery underestimated in the wars of a Song of Ice and Fire","<p>It seems to me that archery is very underestimated in Westeros and Essos in the tactics/strategy point of view.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bran and Arya training archery in Game of Thrones</li>
<li>Theon says (to Bran I think) the ironmen are skilled archers (and lovers)</li>
<li>Some countrymen and rebels seems to use bow and arrow, or sometimes crossbow (in the travels of Arya and Jaime)</li>

<li>The summer islanders are mentioned to have pretty good longbows for distance</li>
<li>Jon and the black brothers at the wall use some archers on the to defend against the wildlings</li>
</ul>

<p>I thinks among the five books that's all I can remember, still it is very little use in war and tactics, the guards who escort the highborn characters never use bows, the kingsguard has no archers, archers are not mentioned in Blackwater battle, or among the mercenary companies, nor even on the raids by Victarion/Ironmen, whose kin are supposed good at archery...</p>

<p>Am I missing or overseeing it? Is it a fact archery are little used in Westeros and Essos?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><game-of-thrones>","32527","<p>Archery was actually rather undervalued in our real history, particularly in medieval Europe, so it isn't terribly surprising for it to be undervalued in the relatively close parallels of Westeros, which was deliberately based in many ways on medieval Europe.</p>

<p>In the feudal systems of Europe, knights, the backbone of medieval armies, were the elite nobility who could afford heavy armor and good steel weapons.</p>

<p>Archery was relegated to low paid professional soldiers or peasant conscripts for centuries.  Many knights disdained archery as ""beneath their station"" or ""unchivalric"".</p>

<p>It wasn't until relatively late in the history of feudal Europe that longbows became recognized as an important strategic asset in warfare.  </p>

<p>One of the most famous early battles where longbows featured heavily was the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Agincourt"" rel=""noreferrer"">Battle of Agincourt</a>.  During the battle, the English forces were outnumbered somewhere between 4-3 and 6-1.  However, the vast majority of the English forces (5/6th of the total troops) were archer units.</p>

<p>This was seen by many as a crippling shortcoming at the time, as evaluations of comparative strength were frequently based on the number of armed knights on either side.</p>

<p>In fact, one account overestimated the already severe imbalance of troop ratios up to ""ten French nobles against one English"", dismissing the archers altogether.</p>

<p>Yet the archers were incredibly decisive during that battle, resulting in thousands of deaths and prisoners on the French side, and scant hundreds of English casualties (possibly as few as 113).</p>

<p>One of the problems with archery in feudal society was that the relatively heavy armor used by the knighted nobility required use of heavy longbows in order for archery to be effective in piercing the targets.</p>

<p>Archers required <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_longbow#Training"" rel=""noreferrer"">extensive training</a> in order for these heavy war longbows to become effective in warfare scenarios.  </p>

<p>Given this, it makes sense that most of the use of bows you list involve targets who are primarily unarmored (wildlings, victims of the Ironborn raids), or are used by those who may not be able to afford steel (countrymen and rebels) or who employ hit-and-run tactics (rebels).</p>

<p>Bran and Arya, and other members of the high nobility, likely trained primarily for hunting and for tournaments (although knowing Ned Stark, it is entirely possible he wanted them proficient for more practical reasons).</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.</em> - Cersei Lannister</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why does Cersei call it <em>Game of Thrones</em> (and why did G.R.R. Martin name it that way)?</p>

<p>In my understanding of the books and the TV show, multiple characters, families and houses play <em>multiple</em> games (mustering, battling, intrigues etc.) to be seated on <em>the</em> Iron Throne. </p>

<p><a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/127794"">This question about the titles of the book</a> also noted that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Game of Thrones refers to the eponymous ""game"" of politics and treason characters play to claim the iron throne and the power that comes with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But then, the throne should be singular because it refers to the game to claim the Iron Throne, and not multiple Thrones.</p>

<p>Therefore, wouldn't it make more sense to call it <em>Games of Throne</em>?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><title-explanation>","168857","<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> It is meant in the metaphorical sense to gain more power.</p>
<p>Not all thrones are the physical one, the Iron Throne. It is meant in a metaphorical sense i.e. &quot;The way you act to gain more power&quot; but that doesn't quite have the same ring to it.</p>
<p>Think of it like Lord Baelish would:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Ladder</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each rung is more power and another metaphorical throne you've won in the game to get more power.</p>
<p>Take another example, The Warden of the North isn't technically a throne but it is a position of major power in the Game of Thrones world. The position is thought over by the Stark's and Bolton's and lately Littlefinger though we eventually see the Stark's prevail, for now.</p>

<p>I did find this <a href=""https://english.stackexchange.com/a/63139"">English SE answer</a> that appears to have the same theory as me on the language behind the name. (Emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think part of the confusion is: if there is only one Iron Throne (as there is in the series), why is &quot;thrones&quot; plural in A Game of Thrones. The answer is that &quot;A Game of Throne&quot;, &quot;A Game of a Throne&quot;, and &quot;A Game of the Throne&quot; all sound really terrible to native English speakers.</p>
<p>Here you should interpret &quot;thrones&quot; as a generic noun, <strong>meaning thrones as an abstract concept rather than referring to any particular one</strong>. In English, if you have a countable noun, the generic must be expressed as plural (with no article). Possibly, the translation into Czech should have been a game in which one might win the (only) throne, if that phrase can be expressed reasonably succinctly in Czech.</p>

"168864","What is going on at Wall fortifications other than Castle Black?","<p>I've only seen the TV series, but it seems that even though Night's Watch has got multiple castles situated on and near the wall and there might be patrols going between them on the wall, Castle Black is the only Night's Watch's location that is shown there. Did I miss any coverage of other Night's Watch's fortifications? Is there any action happening in the books?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","168866","<p>There were originally 19 castles or fortifications on the wall<sup>1</sup>, however as numbers waned the Night's Watch became fewer and fewer. This left just Three Castles manned. <em>Castle Black</em>, which you mentioned is located towards the centre of the wall and is effectively Night's Watch HQ. The other two are <em>Eastwatch-by-the-Sea</em> and <em>The Shadow Tower</em>.</p>
<p>Let's start with the easier of the two.</p>
<h2>The Shadow Tower</h2>
<h3>Game of Thrones</h3>
<p>The Shadow Tower got only few mentions in the series. It first made an appearance when Qhorin Halfhand and some other Rangers joined Jon Snow in scouting out the Wildling Army. Qhorin, Stonesnake, Borba and Harker all died in that scouting after Jon was taken.</p>
<p>It's second appearance was after the death of the Old Bear, when the Commander of The Shadow Tower, Denys Mallister came to the elections of the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. Although he was experienced, he ended up losing to Jon Snow.</p>
<h3>A Song of Ice and Fire</h3>
<p>Qhorin Halfhand leads a ranging from the Shadow Tower in <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, he is however unsuccessful in finding Benjen Stark, First Ranger of the Night's Watch. In the book series, Jeor Mormont considers repopulating Stonedoor with men from the Shadow Tower. Another difference is that the Rangers with Qhorin during the scouting that die are Ebben, Dalbridge and Stonesnake. The men from the Shadow Tower travelling to Castle Black pick up Sam and Gilly en-route, taking them to Castle Black. Regular raids are also discussed at the Shadow Tower.</p>
<h2>Eastwatch-by-the-Sea</h2>
<h3>Game of Thrones</h3>
<p>Eastwatch made a bigger appearance in Season 7, after the Fellowship of the Wights met there to make there ranging into the North. This is where Jon and co. met before they went North to capture a wight and bring it South. It was also the castle destroyed by the Night King. In Season 7 Tormund and his wildlings manned Eastwatch.</p>
<p>It had minor mentions before Season 7, such as Tywin send Janos Slynt there, and Stannis advising Jon to send Alliser Thorne there, Jon however ends up deciding he wants to keep Alliser close.</p>
<h3>A Song of Ice and Fire</h3>
<p>Like at the Shadow Tower, Jeor Mormont considers repopulating Long Barrow with men from Eastwatch, Alliser Thorne is also made Master-at-arms at Eastwatch. Stannis lands at Eastwatch to save Castle Black, and Sam and Gilly set off from Eastwatch with Maester Aemon.</p>
<p>Cotter Pyke takes 11 ships to save the people at Hardhome on a rescue mission. The Giants trying to cross the wall with their mammoths are also sent East to round the wall at Eastwatch as the mammoths are too large to cross the wall.</p>
<p>So although they're very minor, they did have mentions.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> From West to East they are as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Westwatch-by-the-Bridge</li>
<li>The Shadow Tower, commanded by Ser Denys Mallister</li>
<li>Sentinel Stand</li>
<li>Greyguard (mentioned in show)</li>
<li>Stonedoor</li>
<li>Hoarfrost Hill</li>
<li>Icemark</li>
<li>The Nightfort (mentioned in show)</li>
<li>Deep Lake (mentioned in show)</li>
<li>Queensgate</li>
<li>Castle Black, commanded by the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch</li>

<li>Woodswatch-by-the-Pool</li>
<li>Sable Hall</li>
<li>Rimegate</li>

<p>We see that the Night's Watch has to vote to elect a new Lord Commander, but in the show we see (I think?) only those stationed in Castle Black having the possibility to vote.</p>

<p>What is the custom in Westeros, of married noblewomen surnames? Do they change, or not?</p>

<p>Example: when Sansa was forced to marry (twice), did she became Sansa Lannister or Sansa Bolton? Or did she remain Sansa Stark?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","168954","<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> It appears that woman do change their names upon marriage though there are some caveats.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure this won't be answered from the show so I'll use the books.</p>

<p>Catelyn Stark is referred to as Catelyn Stark at least once in the books, after a very brief search and it is in her own POV chapter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Catelyn Stark</strong> stared at the eunuch in stunned disbelief. He was a spider, she thought wildly, an enchanter or worse. He knew things no one could possibly know, unless … ""What have you done to Ser Rodrik?"" she demanded.
  <br><sup>A Game of Thrones - Catelyn IV</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it would appear that woman do change their names upon marriage just like in our world.</p>

<p>However, Jon appears to call her by both names from his POV chapter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Something cold moved in her eyes. ""I told you to leave,"" she said. ""We don't want you here.""
  Once that would have sent him running. Once that might even have made him cry. Now it only made him angry. He would be a Sworn Brother of the Night's Watch soon, and face worse dangers than <strong>Catelyn Tully Stark</strong>. ""He's my brother,"" he said.
  <br><sup>A Game of Thrones - Jon II</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Littlefinger also calls her Tully but he wants her for his own and so probably does it to try and weaken her marriage to Ned in his own eyes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Just what it appears,"" Littlefinger said, easing himself onto a window seat. ""A brothel. Can you think of a less likely place to find a <strong>Catelyn Tully</strong>?"" He smiled. ""As it chances, I own this particular establishment, so arrangements were easily made. I am most anxious to keep the Lannisters from learning that Cat is here in King's Landing.""
  <br><sup>A Game of Thrones - Eddard IV</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also note this quote from the books which seems to imply that she has changed her name:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""<strong>Lady … Stark?</strong>"" Masha Heddle said thickly.
  <br>""<strong>I was still Catelyn Tully</strong> the last time I bedded here,"" she told the innkeep. She could hear the muttering, feel the eyes upon her. Catelyn glanced around the room, at the faces of the knights and sworn swords, and took a deep breath to slow the frantic beating of her heart. Did she dare take the risk? There was no time to think it through, only the moment and the sound of her own voice ringing in her ears. ""You in the corner,"" she said to an older man she had not noticed until now. ""Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your surcoat, ser?""
  <br>The man got to his feet. ""It is, my lady.""
  <br><sup>A Game of Thrones - Catelyn V</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>On further inspection the show seems to back this up. Here's a quote from I believe Tyrion, though I'd have to re-watch to find out:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What happened here? Where is <strong>Lady Stark</strong>? Why didn't she receive me?
  <br>She wasn't feeling well.
  <br><sup>Game of Thrones, S01 E04, ""Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things""</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is also this quote from when Cat arrives at Kings Landing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Welcome to King's Landing, <strong>Lady Stark</strong>.
  <br>Would you mind following us?
  <br>I would.
  <br>We've done nothing wrong.

  <br>I don't know who's providing your instructions, but Follow me, <strong>Lady Stark</strong>.

"169052","Why didn't Ned Stark support this claim to the throne?","<p>Spoilers for the Season 7 finale of <em>Game of Thrones</em>, ""The Dragon and the Wolf"".</p>

<p>It has been confirmed in the television series and <a href=""https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/08/game-of-thrones-george-rr-martin-readers-have-predicted-ending"" rel=""noreferrer"">possibly confirmed</a> in the novels that </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>Jon Snow is the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Additionally it is shown in <em>Game of Thrones</em> that </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Rhaegar and Lyanna married in secret and Jon's true identity is Aegon Targaryen VI</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given Ned Stark knew this information why did he choose to support Stannis' claim to the throne instead of revealing the truth about his nephew and supporting him as the heir?</p>

<p>Doing so would essentially invalidate the rebellion which Ned spent years fighting. But this seems less important considering one of the main causes of the rebellion was based on a lie (as Ned knew). </p>

<p>It certainly seems <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diZPm20DdLM"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ned was ready to tell Jon the truth</a> and not having Robert alive anymore would have certainly helped in this.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","169055","<p>There's a few problems with this.</p>

<p><strong>Night's Watch</strong></p>

<p>Jon had already gone off to the Night's Watch and sworn his vows. This means he legally could not claim the throne even if he knew about his birth right and wanted to. He swore an oath that he would spend his life at the wall with no titles, and it should be a death sentence to break that oath.</p>

<p><strong>Bastard Inheritance</strong></p>

<p>Even thought Ned knew about Jon's true father, it's likely he did not know about the marriage. This means that in Ned's eyes he is still a bastard regardless and would have very little to no claim for the throne.</p>

<p><em>Edit</em>: With regards to Warlord099's comment, yes Ned should believe that Jon is legitimate with Lyanna telling Ned his name is ""Aegon <em>Targaryen</em>"". But! There is an issue of proof then. Even if Ned wants to claim Jon as a true Targaryen he has to prove it which leads to complications that are better left detailed <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/133161/is-there-any-tangible-proof-of-jon-snows-lineage"">here</a>. Not to mention that even with having testimony or evidence of a marriage, it could be disputed or claimed fake. As we know, the true parentage of a character can be falsely claimed and people can believe it such as Robert's ""legitimate"" children.</p>

<p><strong>He made a promise</strong></p>

<p>When Ned took baby Jon from his sister he made a promise to protect him from being killed for his father's blood in him. This was mostly to protect him from the new King Robert. But even with Robert out of the picture declaring Jon as King because he is a Targaryen would put him in severe danger from those that don't wish to give up the throne and those that hate the Targaryens and don't want them in power.</p>

<p><strong>Baratheon Line</strong></p>

<p>With Robert's rebellion the line of succession has changed. Robert claimed the throne with a direct line connecting him to the Targaryen dynasty but mainly through right of conquest. This means that the original Targaryen line of succession has changed and is now following Robert's line the same as it did with Aegon after his conquest. This means that even a ""known"" true born son such as Aegon Targaryen VI from the books or Jon (Aegon Targaryen) Snow of the show would not have a claim without reconquering the kingdom in the name of the Targaryens.</p>

<p><strong>Mix of 1 and 3</strong></p>

<p>As they were both leaving Winterfell for King's Landing and Castle Black, Ned told Jon he was going to tell him the truth the next time they met. This would've been long after Jon had taken his vows and forsaken any claims he could make to the Targaryen house. We can infer that means Ned would be willing to have the truth be known but only when Jon would be safe. For even a true born Targaryen heir at the wall wasn't a threat as Maester Aemon had been there for years. If Ned was insisting on waiting for Jon to be protected by his vows then he would never have gone out of his way to put Jon in direct danger by declaring him the rightful king.</p>

"169133","Did Lyanna's consent even matter?","<p>In the Westerosi society can <strong>an unmarried female of a noble house who has older male relatives</strong> even own property and get married <strong>without the consent of the patriarch of the family</strong>? </p>

<p>It seems that the marriages of daughters of other great houses, Cersei of house Lannister and Catelyn of house Tully were both decided and arranged by their relatives, and we also know that Lyanna herself was less than enthusiastic about her upcoming marriage with Robert Baratheon, and she shared her negative opinion with her brother Ned.</p>

<p>Could it be that when Lyanna's father Rickard Stark and older brother Brandon Stark demanded from the king that the 'kidnapped' Lyanna be returned it was simply because they had other plans for her and the 14-15 year old girl's decision (whether she was coerced, charmed or mutually in love with Rheagar) was irrelevant, as it was not hers to make? 
Could it be that Rhaegar's insult to the Starks was stealing their 'property', a female meant to strengthen their alliance with house Baratheon?
Could it be that they regarded an elopement of a young girl as kidnapping regardless of her opinions of 'silly romantic love', and put all the blame on Rhaegar who, in their opinion, should have known better and therefore was responsible? </p>

<p>Isn't it possible that when they went to negotiate with the king, the plan was either demand Lyanna's return, or if she was 'ruined' by Rheagar, then demand a solution, such as a divorce from Elia Martell or some such?</p>

<p>Was Lyanna the Westerosi equivalent of <a href=""https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Helen/helen.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Helen of Troy</a> who ran away with Paris of her own free will but still was the <s>cause</s> excuse for a war as no one cared what she wanted?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","169151","<p>TL;DR Yes, Noble Women in Westeros can and have defied wishes of the heads of their dynasties, when it comes to marriage. No one can be forced to marry someone without their consent. But in practice, there are numerous instances of people forcing other people to marry someone they do not desire.</p>
<h3>Culture</h3>
<p>The first thing that we have to consider is the Westerosi culture.</p>
<p>Westeros is based on medieval Europe where noble marriages were mostly, if not always, arranged for the political needs of the family. Women are not given equal status as men anywhere except Dorne. We see its manifestation in the succession practices of Westeros. Males always come before females everywhere except Dorne where they inherit on an equal basis primarily because of the Rhoynar influence on the Dornish people. And even in Dorne, marriage pacts are made by the patriarchs/matriarchs, not the women concerned.</p>
<h3>Laws</h3>
<p>Patriarchs apparently consider it their right to make a match for members of their house, regardless to gender. The chief example would be Blackfish: his brother Lord Hoster Tully considered it his legal right to make a match for him, even against his wishes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I told him … commanded him. Marry! <strong>I was his lord. He knows. My
right, to make his match</strong>. A good match. A Redwyne. Old House. Sweet
girl, pretty … freckles … Bethany, yes. Poor child. Still waiting.
Yes. Still …&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bethany Redwyne wed Lord Rowan years ago,&quot; Catelyn reminded him. &quot;She
has three children by him.&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>AGOT - Catelyn XI</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another Westerosi law is that if someone is Ward of the Crown, the Crown has the right to make their match, if the head of the Ward's dynasty is attainted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; Sansa blurted. &quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. You are a ward of the crown. <strong>The king stands in your father's
place, since your brother is an attainted traitor. That means he has
every right to dispose of your hand.</strong> You are to marry my brother
Tyrion.&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>ASOS - Sansa III</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>Marriages are done in religious ceremonies in Westeros and are governed by religious laws.</p>
<p>In the Faith of Seven, the most prevalent faith in Westeros, there is no compulsion in marriage. No one can be pronounced married if they refuse to say the vows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will tell my aunt that I don't want to marry Robert. <strong>Not even the
High Septon himself could declare a woman married if she refused to
say the vows</strong>.<br><sub><em><strong>ASOS - Sansa VII</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the faith of the Old Gods as well, it appears that there can be no marriage unless the couple says the vows out of their own will. Moreover, vows sworn at sword-point are not binding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The monster has tied us a thorny knot,&quot; the old knight told Maester
Luwin. &quot;<strong>Like it or no, Lady Hornwood was his wife. He made her say the</strong>
<strong>vows before both septon and heart tree, and bedded her that very night</strong>
<strong>before witnesses</strong>. She signed a will naming him as heir and fixed her
seal to it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Vows made at sword point are not valid</strong>,&quot; the maester argued.</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Roose Bolton may not agree.</strong> Not with land at issue.&quot; Ser Rodrik
looked unhappy.<br><sub><em><strong>ACOK - Bran V</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, as noted by Ser Rodrik, as long as one party says the vow, people can always object that since vows were sworn, the wedding was binding. There can always be a debate on whether or not the vows were sworn under duress.</p>
<p>So it appears that men and women can withhold their consent and refuse to get married if they want to.</p>
<h3>In Practice</h3>
<p>While it's all good and dandy in religion and laws, in practice these things do not matter.</p>
<p>We know people can force others into marrying against their wishes e.g. Sansa and Tyrion and Tywin's rejected proposal to Wed Cersei to Willas Tyrell. Similarly, Lysa Tully was forced to wed Jon Arryn (Although she was pressurized by Lord Hoster, she consented under the impression that Jon would die soon enough, given his advanced age) and Jon Arryn was forced to wed her. Lady Ermisande, an infant, was married to Tyrek Lannister and no one cared if she couldn't say the vows.</p>
<h3>So Spake Martin</h3>
<p>I have found a relevant Citadel Post. A fan asked GRRM for an explanation of Hoster Tully's declaration that it was his right as Blackfish's Lord to make his match. Does that mean Lords/Patriarchs can force anyone under their rule, regardless to their gender, to marry where they desire? <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Some_Questions/"" rel=""noreferrer"">GRRM's answer</a> was that the concerned people can refuse to say the vows but they can expect dire consequences from their patriarch, which are presumably exile, disinheritance and other forms of punishment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> &quot;I was his lord...My right, to make his match&quot; says Lord Hoster about Brynden. Does it mean that the lord can force anyone
under his rule to marry whomever he wishes? Can the people in question
legally break the commitments made for them by the lord (i.e.
promises, betrothals) and what penalty can the lord visit on them for
this? What if they just refuse to exchange the marriage vows, etc?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> They can indeed refuse to take the vows, as the Blackfish did, but there are often severe consequences to this. The lord is
certainly expected to arrange the matches for his own children and
unmarried younger siblings. He does not necessarily arrange marriages
for his vassal lords or household knights... but they would be wise to
consult with him and respect his feelings. It would not be prudent for
a vassal to marry one of his liege lord's enemies, for instance.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Precedent of women refusing to marry someone</h3>
<p>Alysanne Targaryen would be the first example when she rejected the match made by her mother and step-father. For context, King Jaehaerys had become King after a destructive war between Crown and the Faith during reigns of his father and uncle. The war was sparked by the issue of Targaryen custom of incest, given how it was seen as an affront to the gods by the Faith. Since the King was 14, his mother Alyssa Velaryon served as Queen Regent while her new husband Lord Rogar Baratheon served as the Hand and Lord Protector. Soon enough, The regency council set to find suitable matches for the King and his younger sister. While the council was aware that the young princelings would choose each other if given the choice, they had no intention to wed them given how much blood and grief had the custom of incest already caused. Notoriously ambitious, Lord Rogar proposed his brother Orryn Baratheon as groom for Princess Alysanne and the council assented (Choosing the King's bride proved more contentious and no consensus was found). Alysanne got the word of the council's plans, probably by her uncle Lord Daemon Velaryon, who may have resented the Baratheons for overreaching themselves and trying to replace Velaryons as the second House of the realm. Alysanne knew protests and pleading with her mother won't change anything so she immediately went to the King and urged him to pre-empt the council. The King shared her feelings and ordered his Kingsguards to sail for Dragonstone in secrecy right away. The King and his sister took wing for Dragonstone the same day without telling anyone. Once there, they were wed by Dragonstone's septon. Jaehaerys however decided not to consummate the wedding given Alysanne's young age. When the Lord Hand and Queen Regent came pursuing to Dragonstone a week later, they were horrified to find what had happened. Once Lord Hand realised that the wedding was not consummated, he tried to confine the King and his Queen to separate chambers until the wedding could be annulled. Kingsguards however threatened that if anyone laid hands on their King or Queen, he'd die. The Queen regent proclaimed she had seen enough blood and now they must all live with what had happened. King agreed and warned her that she should not assume that she'd be able to unmake their marriage. Alysanne concurred, to quote her:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Never,” his bride affirmed. “Send me to the ends of the earth and wed me to the King of Mossovy or the Lord of the Grey Waste, Silverwing will always bring me back to Jaehaerys.”<br><sub><em><strong>Fire and Blood</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then we have the case of Princess Daella Targaryen, daughter to the very same King Jaehaerys I and Queen Alysanne. She rejected a number of suitors suggested by her mother for variety of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The dashing grandson to Lord of Driftmark, Corlys Velaryon was rejected because the Princess believed he liked his ships better than her. He eventually married Daella's niece Rhaenys.</li>
<li>Denys Swann, son of the Lord of Stonehelm and Gerold Templeton, son of the Knight of Ninestars  were rejected because the Princess decided she hated them.</li>
<li>Simon Staunton, son of Lord of Rook's Rest was rejected because he tried to make her drink wine (She was 14).</li>
<li>Ellard Crane, son of the Lord of Red Lake was rejected because he kissed her without her leave.</li>
<li>Lord Blackwood's son Royce Blackwood was a close one. The Princess got along with him famously. Lord Blackwood and the Crown began discussing wedding dates and arrangements. It all fell apart when the Princess refused to marry him because she'd only just learnt that the Blackwoods kept the Old Gods and she didn't want to go to hell by marrying a heathen.</li>
</ol>
<p>The King despaired of her and flatly told the Queen to wed her quickly because he no longer cared who she chose as long as she picked someone, otherwise they'd have to send her to the Silent Sisters (Queen suggested that she should be made a Septa, the King rejected that because the Princess was not very gifted intellectually). Of course we must note that the King and the Queen didn't force her to marry until she rejected Blackwood boy. The Queen offered her a final choice of three great Lords which included the Queen's half-brother Lord Boremund Baratheon, Ser Tymond Lannister (Heir to Casterly Rock) and Lord Rodrik Arryn. The Princess chose Rodrik Arryn who already had four children and was close to her father's age.</p>
<p>Another unsuccessful example would be Princess Rhaenyra. Her father wanted her to marry Laenor Velaryon. The princess refused given Laenor's reputation for preferring the company of men. The King couldn't force her so instead he pleaded, reasoned, begged her to consent. The Princess wouldn't budge. It wasn't until Viserys threatened to disinherit her that the Princess finally gave her consent. While unsuccessful, it shows us that a woman can refuse the match made by the head of her dynasty. The best the head can do is threaten her with consequences. For someone prepared to face the consequences, it might not matter at all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>King and council had neglected to consult the princess, however, and Rhaenyra proved to be very much her father’s daughter, with her own
notions about whom she wished to wed</strong>. The princess knew much and
more about Laenor Velaryon and had no wish to be his bride. “My half
brothers would be more to his taste,” she told the king (the princess
always took care to refer to Queen Alicent’s sons as half brothers,
never as brothers). And though <strong>His Grace reasoned with her, pleaded
with her, shouted at her, and called her an ungrateful daughter, no
words of his could budge her</strong> … until the <strong>king brought up the
question of succession</strong>. What a king had done, a king could undo,
Viserys pointed out. <strong>She would wed as he commanded, or he would make
her half brother Aegon his heir in place of her. At this the
princess’s will gave way.</strong><br><sub><em><strong>The Rogue Prince</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also the case of Baela Targaryen. She was the heir of her brother King Aegon III during his minority. Since House Targaryen was nearly extinguished except King Aegon and his sisters (his brother Prince Viserys was missing and presumed dead), the regents wanted to secure the royal line in case some ill befell the King. As the King was a minor, it had to be his sisters who would have to wed and give birth to more Targaryens.</p>
<p>Unlike her courteous and gentle twin sister Rhaena, Baela was wild and daring. As she continued to consort with comely hedge knights, mummers, singers and other unsuitable people, the Regency council feared that she might <em>dishonour</em> her brother and the Crown if she weren't wed soon. A number of great Lords or their heirs were discussed and rejected by the council because they feared that a strong man might usurp the rule from Baela if she ever sat the throne. Then Thaddeus Rowan's name was suggested. Lord Rowan was well liked, respected and of a high and noble bloodline, he was the perfect match due to his content and amiable nature. Except that he was forty years older than the Princess and already had children (Two of whom she claimed to have bedded - which may have been a lie because she often liked to provoke the regents), nor was he physically attractive.</p>
<p>Baela said as much and the Hand confined her to her rooms under guard and she was to stay there until the regents decided what to do. She went to the room as ordered but within a day, she escaped dressed as a washerwoman and before the Regents even noticed, she was half-way to Driftmark where her cousin the powerful Lord Alyn Velaryon ruled. 15 days later she was married to Lord Alyn defying the wishes of the regents who claimed to speak for her brother (The King was neither informed nor consulted on the matter).</p>
<p>Some on the council wished to appeal to the High Septon to annul the marriage but the Hand personally accepted it and issued a public statement that the marriage was arranged by the Council with the consent of the King. He believed the Princess' choice was sound, Lord Alyn was after-all of impeccable Valyrian blood, popular, a great lord in his own right and a celebrated admiral at such a young age. The scandal was not the marriage, but rather the fact that Baela had eloped so that was what they must hide.</p>
<p>So while the council was happy for the young couple as far as public image was concerned, Baela's daring cost her her place as the heir apparent. The council quietly agreed that Baela must be passed over and Rhaena should be considered the heir. Baela's defiance however produced some positive results too, when considering Rhaena's prospective husband, the council included her in their sessions. Charming and courteous as usual Rhaena reassured the council that she would wed whoever the council deemed suitable but the Hand still sought her own thoughts on the matter. Rhaena immediately confessed she liked Ser Corwyn Corbray. As a second son of a not <em>that great</em> house, he was not ideal but the regents accepted Rhaena's choice and had them married (In part because Corwyn's elder brother was an important member of the council). One could say that Baela pulled <em>a Lyanna</em> (Or rather Lyanna pulled a Baela), but Baela's marriage proved to be much happier than Lyanna's.</p>
<p>Another xample would be Princess Shaera Targaryen. She was betrothed to Lord Luthor Tyrell but it was her brother Jaehaerys whom she desired. She knew their father, Aegon V, who disliked the Targaryen custom of incest, would never approve of it. So instead of taking it up with the King, the Princess and the Prince eloped. In doing so, Shaera ended her betrothal to Lord Tyrell and her brother's betrothal to Celia Tully. She didn't refuse as such, as she knew the futility of such refusals, she instead took matters into her own hands.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Prince Jaehaerys was of a more traditional bent, for from a very early age he had loved his sister Shaera</strong> and dreamed of wedding her
in the old Targaryen fashion. Once aware of his desires, <strong>King Aegon
and Queen Betha had done their best to separate the two</strong>, yet somehow
distance only seemed to inflame the mutual passion of this prince and
princess.</p>
<p>Prince Jaehaerys was not as forceful as his brother, but when Duncan
defied his father to follow his own heart, and the king and court
yielded to his desire, the younger prince did not fail to take note.
In 240 AC, a year after Prince Duncan's marriage, <strong>Prince Jaehaerys
and Princess Shaera each eluded their guardians and were secretly
married</strong>. Jaehaerys was fifteen and Shaera fourteen at the time of
their wedding. <strong>By the time the king and queen learned what had
happened, the marriage had already been consummated. Aegon felt he had
no choice but to accept it.</strong><br><sub><em><strong>TWOIAF - Targaryen Kings:
Aegon V</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Olenna Redwyne was betrothed to Prince Daeron Targaryen. There are however conflicting accounts of how the betrothal ended. Olenna Tyrell says she put an end to it herself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Her grandmother snorted. &quot;Gallant, yes, and charming, and very clean.
He knew how to dress and he knew how to smile and he knew how to
bathe, and somehow he got the notion that this made him fit to be
king. The Baratheons have always had some queer notions, to be sure.
It comes from their Targaryen blood, I should think.&quot; She sniffed.
&quot;<strong>They tried to marry me to a Targaryen once, but I soon put an end
to that.</strong>&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>ASOS - Sansa I</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She doesn't mention how she put an end to it. Did she refuse explicitly? Or did she ask the prince to call off the wedding?</p>
<p>In the TV show, she said that she had actually seduced Lord Tyrell who was betrothed to her sister, who then asked to marry her instead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I wasn't originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor</strong>, you know. <strong>He was engaged to my sister</strong>, your great-aunt Viola.</p>
<p><strong>I was to be given to some Targaryen</strong> or other. Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then. But <strong>the moment I saw my intended, with
his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he
wouldn't do</strong>.</p>
<p>So <strong>the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister, I got lost
on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his
chamber</strong>. How absentminded of me.</p>
<p>The following morning, <strong>Luthor never made it down the stairs to
propose to my sister</strong> 'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk.</p>
<p>And once he could, <strong>the only thing he wanted was what I'd given him
the night before</strong>. I was good. I was very, very good.<br><sub><em><strong>Season 4 -
Oathkeeper</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that is in contrast with the books as Luthor Tyrell himself was betrothed to the above mentioned Princess Shaera Targaryen, sister to Prince Daeron. But in any case, Olenna didn't get married to Daeron Targaryen and got married to Luthor Tyrell instead.</p>
<p>The World of Ice and Fire however suggests that it was Prince Daeron who called off the wedding as he was homosexual and had no interest in women.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Corrupted by the example of his brothers, even King Aegon's youngest
son Prince Daeron vexed his father in like manner. <strong>Though betrothed
to Lady Olenna Redwyne of the Arbor when both of them were nine,
Prince Daeron repudiated the match in 246 AC, when he was
eighteen</strong>...though in his case, there appears to have been no other
woman, for <strong>Daeron remained unwed</strong> throughout the remainder of his
short life. A born soldier who rejoiced in tournament and battle, <strong>he
preferred the companionship of Ser Jeremy Norridge</strong><br><sub><em><strong>TWOIAF - Targaryen Kings: Aegon V</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is possible that Olenna and Daeron worked together to call off their wedding. Daeron grew up in Highgarden after all, where he was sent as a squire. Olenna Redwyne's father was a chief vassal of Highgarden so she would have had ample opportunities of meeting her betrothed and plotting to call off the wedding.</p>
<p>In more recent events, Princess Arianne Martell rejected all the suitors her father Prince Doran Martell presented her. She wanted a young handsome man of powerful background instead of old men but her father always presented her with Old men. When Renly Baratheon came to Dorne, Arianne tried her best to <em>seduce</em> him, in hopes of him asking for her hand. King's handsome youngest brother however seemed only bemused, rather than aroused by her antics (Arianne blames herself for the failure, thinking it was her young age which failed her. We know it was rather Renly's sexual orientation.) Then Hoster Tully sent proposal of his heir Ser Edmure Tully, Princess Arianne lit a candle in sept to thank the gods but her father promptly refused the offer. She got so desperate that she was willing to accept even Willas Tyrell, the crippled heir to Highgarden. She went as far as fleeing towards Highgarden without her father's leave to meet Willas, she was however intercepted by her uncle Prince Oberyn on the way and brought back to Sunspear. Her father was unwilling to let any young, handsome highborn man be her suitor and the princess was unwilling to accept any of the old men her Father presented her. Her father even presented her with Lord Walder Frey, it wasn't until Walder married elsewhere that she was truly safe from him. She rejected them all. But we know why her father behaved as he did. That's another story. What matters is, she rejected them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prince Doran did not mean for her to wed a Dornishman.</p>
<p>Arianne had accepted that as well. One year King <strong>Robert's brother
came to visit and she did her best to seduce him, but she was half a
girl and Lord Renly seemed more bemused</strong> than inflamed by her
overtures. Later, when <strong>Hoster Tully asked her to come to Riverrun
and meet his heir</strong>, she lit candles to the Maid in thanks, but Prince
Doran had declined the invitation. <strong>The princess might even have
considered Willas Tyrell, crippled leg and all, but her father refused
to send her to Highgarden to meet him</strong>. She tried to go despite him,
with Tyene's help . . . but Prince Oberyn caught them at Vaith and
brought them back.</p>
<p>That same year, Prince Doran tried to betroth her to Ben Beesbury, a
minor lordling who was eighty if he was a day, and as blind as he was
toothless. Beesbury died a few years later. That gave her some small
comfort in her present pass; she could not be forced to marry him if
he was dead. And the Lord of the Crossing had wed again, so she was
safe from him as well. Elden Estermont is still alive and unwed,
though. Lord Rosby and Lord Grandison as well. Grandison was called
the Greybeard, but by the time she'd met him his beard had gone snow
white. At the welcoming feast, he had gone to sleep between the fish
course and the meat. Drey called that apt, since his sigil was a
sleeping lion. Garin challenged her to see if she could tie a knot in
his beard without waking him, but Arianne refrained. Grandison had
seemed a pleasant fellow, less querulous than Estermont and more
robust than Rosby. <strong>She would never marry him, however. Not even if
Hotah stands behind me with his axe</strong>.<br><sub><em><strong>AFFC - The Princess in the Tower</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In theory Lyanna's consent mattered. She could refuse to say the vows and make her own destiny if she was brave enough which, as it happened, she was. But Lord Rickard could force Lyanna to marry Robert in practice.</p>

"169167","What did Tywin mean when he said this to Jaime about needing all the help he can get?","<p>In <strong>S04E01</strong> we have a dialogue between Jaime Lannister and his father.

<blockquote>
  <p>A one-handed man with no family needs all the help he can get.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why did he say that? Did he imply that since his son refused to obey him he will no longer help him or that since he decided to remain in the Kingsguard, he will be heir no more and by extension, be no part of the family?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","169191","<h3>Show</h3>
<p>Tywin actually disowned Jaime there. He wanted Jaime to do his duty to his family, Jaime refused. Tywin noted that he has tried for forty years to teach him and if Jaime has not learnt by now, he never will. Kingsguard only forsake their claims, not their family names like Maesters do. His vows don't make him any less part of House Lannister. Its his insistence that his duty as KG comes above his duty as a Lannister that made Tywin disown him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tywin: You can't serve in the Kingsguard with one hand.</p>
<p>Jaime: Where's that written? I can and I will. The Kingsguard oath is
for life.</p>
<p>Tywin: The war is over. The king is safe.</p>
<p>Jaime: The king is never safe. How many people in this city alone
would love to see his head on a pike?</p>
<p>Tywin: Other knights protected the king while you were a prisoner.
They will continue to do so when you go home.</p>
<p>Jaime: Home?</p>

<p>Jaime: Supper would be nice.</p>

by now, you never will. Go. If serving as a glorified bodyguard is the
sum of your ambition, go serve.</strong></p>

<p>Jaime took the hint and said as much to Cersei. Cersei disagreed however.</p>

from Highgarden while I'm supposed to marry her brother, a renowned

<p>Turned out Cersei was right. Tywin accepted Jaime's offer to become heir to Casterly Rock if he let Tyrion live afterwards.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Books</h3>
<p>This is how it happened in the books, it was more clear that Tywin had disowned Jaime after he refused to do service for his house and when Tywin said he was his son, Jaime said he was a Knight of Kingsguard. So one can say, it was Jaime who burnt the bridges.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“You cannot serve in the Kingsguard without a sword hand -”</strong></p>
<p>“<strong>I can</strong>,” he interrupted. “And I will. There’s precedent. I’ll look
in the White Book and find it, if you like. <strong>Crippled or whole, a
knight of the Kingsguard serves for life.</strong>”</p>
<p>“<strong>Cersei ended that when she replaced Ser Barristan</strong> on grounds of
age. A suitable gift to the Faith will persuade the High Septon to
release you from your vows. Your sister was foolish to dismiss Selmy,
admittedly, but now that <strong>she has opened the gates</strong> -”</p>
<p>“- <strong>someone needs to close them again</strong>.” Jaime stood. “I am tired of
having highborn women kicking pails of shit at me, Father. No one ever
asked me if I wanted to be Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, but it
seems I am. <strong>I have a duty</strong> -”</p>
<p>“<strong>You do.</strong>” Lord Tywin rose as well. “<strong>A duty to House Lannister.
You are the heir to Casterly Rock.</strong> That is where you should be.
Tommen should accompany you, as your ward and squire. The Rock is
where he’ll learn to be a Lannister, and I want him away from his
mother. I mean to find a new husband for Cersei. Oberyn Martell
perhaps, once I convince Lord Tyrell that the match does not threaten
Highgarden. And it is past time you were wed. The Tyrells are now
insisting that Margaery be wed to Tommen, but if I were to offer you
instead -”</p>
<p>“NO!” Jaime had heard all that he could stand. No, more than he could
stand. He was sick of it, sick of lords and lies, sick of his father,
his sister, sick of the whole bloody business. “<strong>No. No. No. No. No.
How many times must I say no before you’ll hear it?</strong> Oberyn Martell?
The man’s infamous, and not just for poisoning his sword. He has more
bastards than Robert, and beds with boys as well. And if you think for
one misbegotten moment that I would wed Joffrey’s widow...”</p>
<p>“Lord Tyrell swears the girl’s still maiden.”</p>
<p>“She can die a maiden as far as I’m concerned. I don’t want her, and I
don’t want your Rock!”</p>
<p>“<strong>You are my son</strong> -”</p>
<p>“<strong>I am a knight of the Kingsguard. The Lord Commander of the
Kingsguard! And that’s all I mean to be!</strong>”</p>
<p>Firelight gleamed golden in the stiff whiskers that framed Lord
Tywin’s face. A vein pulsed in his neck, but he did not speak. And did
not speak. And did not speak.</p>
<p>The strained silence went on until it was more than Jaime could
endure.</p>
<p>“Father...” he began. <br><br>“<strong>You are not my son</strong>.” Lord Tywin turned his face
away. “<strong>You say you are the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, and only
that. Very well, ser. Go do your duty</strong>.”<br><sub><em><strong>ASOS - Jaime VIII</strong></em></sub></p>

"169170","How many known volcanoes are there in Westeros?","<p>We know that Dragonstone is a volcanic island, with <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragonmont"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dragonmont</a> being the volcano proper. It is also said to contain large deposits of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragonglass"" rel=""noreferrer"">obsidian</a>. If my memory serves me well, it is the only explicitly mentioned volcano in Westeros.</p>

<p>Even looking at the rest of the world, except the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Fourteen_Flames"" rel=""noreferrer"">Fourteen Flames</a> around Valyria, and possibly some other in <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Asshai"" rel=""noreferrer"">Asshai</a> and the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Shadow_Lands"" rel=""noreferrer"">Shadow Lands</a> (they are said to have obsidian amongst their main exports, they have to mine it somewhere), I don't recall any other volcano being mentioned in the books.</p>

<p><strong>Are there any other known volcanoes (not necessarily active) in Westeros and on other continents?</strong> Or are they really so rare as it may seem on a first impression?</p>

<p>On a side note, I have also noted a particular coincidence, they tend to be present (only?) on places more or less related to dragons (Dragonstone, Valyria, the Shadow Lands<sup>1</sup>), and, if we assume that dragons are linked to magic, we can also infer that volcanoes themselves have an indirect connection with magic (as it seems even by looking at the particular properties of obsidian in this world, that can kill undeads and can be made in to <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Glass_candle"" rel=""noreferrer"">candles</a> that theoretically could burn).<br>
<em>Very probably the real reason is the exact opposite, dragons find in volcanoes a natural habitat, so maybe dragons are present where volcanoes are, and not the other way around; I just wanted to point this out.</em></p>

<p><strong>Is there some evidence in the books or in other official sources (interviews and so on) that explains something more about this <em>supposed</em> rarity of volcanoes?</strong> And maybe also their relation with dragons (and possibly magic)?</p>

","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","180215","<p>The only confirmed volcanoes we have are the two in your question.</p>

<h3>The Fourteen Flames</h3>

<p>The Fourteen Flames around Valyria are what eventually erupted and caused the Doom.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To this day, no one knows what caused the Doom. Most say that it was a natural cataclysm—a catastrophic explosion caused by the eruption of all Fourteen Flames together.<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice and Fire, Ancient History: The Doom of Valyria</sub></p>

<h3>Dragonmont</h3>

<p>The volcano on Dragonstone and is noted to still be active as steam rises from its vents.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And yet . . . and yet . . . the comet burned even by day now, while pale grey steam rose from the hot vents of Dragonmont behind the castle, and yestermorn a white raven had brought word from the Citadel itself, word long-expected but no less fearful for all that, word of summer's end. Omens, all. Too many to deny. What does it all mean? he wanted to cry.<br>
  <sub>A Clash of Kings, Prologue</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>However, there is mention to other volcanic activity such as the following.</p>

<h3>Hot Springs</h3>

<p>There are hot springs at Winterfell which are warmed by volcanic activity beneath the ground and the maesters have noted this. I've seen mention that the Dreadfort is also heated by hot springs but I can't track down a reference for this at the moment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hot springs such as the one beneath Winterfell have been shown to be heated by the furnaces of the world—the same fires that made the Fourteen Flames or the smoking mountain of Dragonstone. Yet the smallfolk of Winterfell and the winter town have been known to claim that the springs are heated by the breath of a dragon that sleeps beneath the castle. This is even more foolish than Mushroom's claims and need not be given any consideration.<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice and Fire, The North: Winterfell</sub></p>

<h3>Brimstone</h3>

<p>There are various mentions to smelling brimstone and the rock brimstone, however, in Dorne there is a river called Brimstone. This is known for it's yellow waters which stink of sulfur.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Brimstone is a far more placid stream, but its cloudy yellow waters stink of sulfur, and the plants that grow along its banks are strange and stunted things.<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice and Fire, Dorne</sub></p>

<h3>Mother of Mountains</h3>

<p>Although not confirmed either way it has been speculated on that the Mother of Mountains is a dormant volcano with the Womb of the World also being a part of the volcanic activity that was once there.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The horselords have only one permanent settlement: the ""city"" they call Vaes Dothrak, which stands beneath the shadow of the lonely peak they call the Mother of Mountains, beside a bottomless lake they name the Womb of the World. It is here that the Dothraki believe their race was born. No true city, Vaes Dothrak has neither walls nor streets. Its grassy thoroughfares are lined with stolen gods, its palaces made of woven grass.<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice and Fire, Beyond the Free Cities: The Grasslands</sub></p>

<h3>Casterly Rock</h3>

<p>Again although it's speculation I've seen it mentioned that the Rock is likely a volcanic plug and similar to Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh. I'm no geologist but from what I've read gold can also be found where there was once volcanic activity this supports the theory more.</p>

<h3>Skagos</h3>

<p>Although not confirmed again Skagos does have mountains.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dareon knew the songs as well. When the bleak grey peaks of Skagos rose up from the sea, he joined Sam at Blackbird's prow, and said, ""If the gods are good, we may catch a glimpse of a unicorn.""<br>
  <sub>A Feast for Crows, Samwell II</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's also mentioned that the Skagosi trade obsidian blades and arrowheads so they are likely to have dragonglass deposits on their island.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For most of recorded history, they have remained an isolated, backward, savage folk, as like to murder those who land upon their isle as to trade with them. When they do consent to trade, the Skagosi offer pelts, obsidian blades and arrowheads, and ""unicorn horns"" for goods they desire.<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice and Fire, The North: The Stoneborn of Skagos</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Hardhome</h3>

<p>There is speculation that the disaster at Hardhome was the result of volcanic activity and looking at the description it is possible. Though of course it could have just been an ordinary fire.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He did. Hardhome had been halfway toward becoming a town, the only true town north of the Wall, until the night six hundred years ago <strong>when hell had swallowed it.</strong> Its people had been carried off into slavery or slaughtered for meat, depending on which version of the tale you believed, their homes and halls consumed in a <strong>conflagration that burned so hot that watchers on the Wall far to the south had thought the sun was rising in the north. Afterward ashes rained down on haunted forest and Shivering Sea alike for almost half a year.</strong> Traders reported finding only nightmarish devastation where Hardhome had stood, a landscape of charred trees and burned bones, waters choked with swollen corpses, blood-chilling shrieks echoing from the cave mouths that pocked the great cliff that loomed above the settlement.<br>

  <p>Hardhome was once the only settlement approaching a town in the lands beyond the Wall, sheltered on Storrold's Point and commanding a deepwater harbor. But six hundred years ago, <strong>it was burned and its people destroyed</strong>, though the Watch cannot say for a certainty what happened. Some say that cannibals from Skagos fell on them, others that slavers from across the narrow sea were at fault. The strangest stories, from a ship of the Watch sent to investigate, tell of <strong>hideous screams echoing down from the cliffs above Hardhome, where no living man or woman could be found.</strong><br>

Lord Mormont was Lord Mormont at the wall before he became Lord Commander, similarly, Ser Alliser Thorne was knighted during the Targaryen rule and fought along side the Royalists during Robert's Rebellion</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alliser was a knight of House Thorne in the crownlands and fought on the side of House Targaryen during Robert's Rebellion.<br />
<sub><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Alliser_Thorne"" rel=""noreferrer"">A Wiki of Ice and Fire - Sir Alliser Thorne</a></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ser Alliser Thorne did not lose his title when he came to the wall, just like Lord Slynt didn't.</p>
<p>As for the words in the oath quoted by TheLethalCoder,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This simply means that they will not take any more crowns. They forsake their right to be the heir of their house or the Seven Kingdoms when they come to the wall. They can no longer return to their houses and take up the Lordship of their house. As for win no glory. They will not be raised for their glory in battle, they will gain no lands and no titles. They live to serve the Night's Watch and will die serving the Night's Watch.</p>
<p>The only orders where your House is removed his with the Maesters and the Faith, they only retain their first name, this led Maester Aemon to lead a forgotten life as the Last Targaryen living in Westeros. Otherwise, only the High Septon has to give up their name entirely. Although this seems to have been contradicted by the final episode of Season 7.</p>

Furthermore, as Wardens of the North, the Starks feel a particular responsibility to keep the Night's Watch strong.  </p>

<p>So how come Robb Stark chose to simply execute Lord Rickard Karstark as punishment for murdering the Lannister hostages?  Did Robb not feel the same responsibility to the Night's Watch?  Would this option have been considered and then rejected for some reason?  Would his counsellors have advised him to consider this course of action?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","169617","<h1>A Song of Ice and Fire</h1>
<p>Leniency does not come with disrespect, it requires remorse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Has Your Grace forgotten that we are at war with Casterly Rock? In war you kill your enemies. Didn’t your father teach you that, boy?”<br />
“Boy?” The Greatjon dealt Rickard Karstark a buffet with a mailed fist that sent the other lord to his knees.<br />
“Leave him!” Robb’s voice rang with command. Umber stepped back away from the captive.<br />
Lord Karstark spit out a broken tooth. “Yes, Lord Umber, leave me to the king. He means to give me a scolding before he forgives me. That’s how he deals with treason, our King in the North.” He smiled a wet red smile. “or should I call you the King Who Lost the North, Your Grace?”<br />
<sub>A Storm of Swords - Catelyn III</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This evidently shows that Karstark has no respect for Robb, thinking of him as weak for losing the North and for going on this fools plight to &quot;rescue&quot; his sisters and avenge his father. Even the Greatjon is enraged by the disrespect and beats Lord Karstark.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Pardon him, then,” urged Edmure Tully.<br />
Robb stared at him in frank disbelief.<br />
Under that gaze, Edmure’s face reddened. “Spare his life, I mean. I don’t like the taste of it any more than you, sire. He slew my men as well. Poor Delp had only just recovered from the wound Ser Jaime gave him. Karstark must be punished, certainly. Keep him in chains, say.”<br />
“A hostage?” said Catelyn. It might be best...<br />
“Yes, a hostage!” Her brother seized on her musing as agreement. “Tell the son that so long as he remains loyal, his father will not be harmed. Otherwise... we have no hope of the Freys now, not if I offered to marry all Lord Walder’s daughters and carry his litter besides. If we should lose the Karstarks as well, what hope is there?”<br />
<sub>ibid.</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Robb had evidently given this though, with both his mother and uncle pleading with him, Robb had some reason to be defiant, something led him to his decision for execution and not a pardoning.</p>
<p>Robb later states clear and true why he had to execute the Lord.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I know what I said, Uncle. It does not change what I must do.” The swords in his crown stood stark and black against his brow. “In battle I might have slain Tion and Willem myself, but this was no battle. They were asleep in their beds, naked and unarmed, in a cell where I put them. Rickard Karstark killed more than a Frey and a Lannister. He killed my honor. I shall deal with him at dawn.”<br />
<sub>ibid.</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Robb's honour had been tainted for that Lord Karstark must be executed.<br />
Not only that but Robb could not look weak in front of his men. Any common sellsword would've been executed for the act, he had to portray the same strength for those of greater lineage. Showing weakness would cause his army to lose faith in him. He had to remain strong and fair, he passed the sentence, and he had to swing the sword.</p>
<h1>Game Of Thrones</h1>
<p>In the TV Show, Rickard Karstark repeatedly insults Robb before his death. Not only did Rickard betray Robb's trust. He broke his honour. Killing two boys in their cell while they slep.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It's treason to free your enemies! In war, you kill your enemies! Did your father not teach you that, boy!?&quot;<br />
<sub>Rickard to Robb Stark</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rickard clearly does not value Robb's decision. Again, leniency doesn't come with disrespect, it comes with contrition. Of which Rickard showed non.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Leave me to the King. He wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free. That's how he deals with treason. Our King in the North. Or should I call him 'the King who lost the North'?&quot;<br />
<sub>Rickard to Brynden Tully</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again Rickard calls Robb a craven, saying he won't be able to kill him, mocking the King, his King. Not only that but he also gives up on Robb's cause. After the Iron Islanders had taken the North while they were in the Riverlands, claiming he &quot;lost the North&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rickard Karstark: &quot;The blood of the First Men flows in my veins as much as yours, boy. I fought the Mad King for your father. I fought Joffrey for you. We are kin, Stark and Karstark.&quot;<br />
Robb Stark: &quot;That didn't stop you from betraying me, and it won't save you now.&quot;<br />
Rickard Karstark: &quot;I don't want it to save me. I want it to haunt you to the end of your days.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, Karstark expresses his disdain. He continues to mock Robb.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Kill me and be cursed! You are no King of mine!&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, Karstark gives up on the King entirely. He shows no respect even at his death.</p>

<h1>Too Long Version</h1>
<h3>The Winged Lion</h3>
<p>When Tyrion was sent by Ilyrio to join Daenerys, he was entrusted to a sell sword by the name of Griff and his company.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The magister shrugged. &quot;Much as it would please me to welcome Queen
Daenerys to Volantis, <strong>I must rely on you and Griff for that</strong>. I can
serve her best in Pentos, smoothing the way for her return. So long as
I am with you, though … well, an old fat man must have his comforts,
yes? Come, drink a cup of wine.&quot;</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Tyrion waved the dish away. &quot;<strong>You place a deal of trust in this man</strong>
<strong>Griff</strong>. Another friend of your childhood?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. A sellsword, you would call him, but Westerosi born. Daenerys
needs men worthy of her cause.&quot; Illyrio raised a hand. &quot;I know!
'Sellswords put gold before honor,' you are thinking. 'This man Griff
will sell me to my sister.' Not so. <strong>I trust Griff as I would trust a</strong>
<strong>brother</strong>.&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>ADWD - Tyrion II</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was a half Maester, two Knights and one soiled septa in the company. And a young boy, called the Young Griff, who Illyrio said was Griff's beloved son.</p>
<p>He was introduced to the maester and one Knight right away:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;So he does. I am Haldon, the healer in our little band of brothers.
Some call me Halfmaester. My companion is Ser Duck.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ser Rolly,&quot; said the big man. &quot;Rolly Duckfield. Any knight can make a
knight, and Griff made me. And you, dwarf?&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>ADWD - Tyrion III</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So now Tyrion knew that Griff was a Knight too. Exiled Westerosi Knights always have some interesting backgrounds.</p>
<p>Then he met Griff himself. First thing odd he noted was that Griff could read and that too, without moving his lips at all. Among the Westerosi, it's only Highborns who can do that due to being used to reading since childhood. Other than them, Maesters are also good at reading. Lowborns mostly can't read or if they learn, they move their lips.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Haldon answered. &quot;Illyrio sent a letter to explain.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I will have it, then. Take the dwarf to my cabin.&quot;</p>
<p>I do not like his eyes, Tyrion reflected, when the sellsword sat down
across from him in the dimness of the boat's interior, with a scarred
plank table and a tallow candle between them. They were ice blue,
pale, cold. The dwarf misliked pale eyes. Lord Tywin's eyes had been
pale green and flecked with gold.</p>
<p><strong>He watched the sellsword read. That he could read said something all by itself. How many sellswords could boast of that? He hardly moves
his lips at all, Tyrion reflected.</strong><br><sub><em><strong>ADWD - Tyrion III</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Tyrion caught him lying about his identity right away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Griff ignored the request. Instead he touched the letter to the candle
flame and watched the parchment blacken, curl, and flare up. &quot;There is
blood between Targaryen and Lannister. Why would you support the cause
of Queen Daenerys?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For gold and glory,&quot; the dwarf said cheerfully. &quot;Oh, and hate. If you
had ever met my sister, you would understand.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I understand hate well enough.&quot; From the way Griff said the word,
Tyrion knew that much was true. He has supped on hate himself, this
one. It has warmed him in the night for years.</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Then we have that in common, ser</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>I am no knight</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Not only a liar, but a bad one. That was clumsy and stupid, my lord.</strong> &quot;And yet Ser Duck says you knighted him.&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>ADWD - Tyrion III</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An Exiled Knight who doesn't want to reveal his identity? Why would that be? He speaks like a Highborn man. And his desire to hide his true colors is interesting still. Which is why Tyrion came to the conclusion that this one was some exiled Lord.</p>
<p>Tyrion was sure of it but he held his tongue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Griff weighed that for a moment. &quot;Understand this, dwarf. You are the
last and least of our company. Hold your tongue and do as you are
told, or you will soon wish you had.&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, Father, Tyrion almost said. &quot;As you say, my lord.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>&quot;I am no lord.&quot;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Liar</strong>. &quot;It was a courtesy, my friend.&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>ADWD - Tyrion III</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So who was this exiled Lord, going to join Daenerys Targaryen? One particular exiled Lord, who was loyal to Targaryens to a fault and was the right age, came to his mind and he decided to see if he was right.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tyrion made a waddling bow, but at the cabin door, he turned back.
&quot;What if we should find the queen and discover that this talk of
dragons was just some sailor's drunken fancy? This wide world is full
of such mad tales. Grumkins and snarks, ghosts and ghouls, mermaids,
rock goblins, winged horses, winged pigs … <strong>winged lions</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>Griff stared at him, frowning. &quot;<strong>I have given you fair warning,
Lannister. Guard your tongue or lose it</strong>. Kingdoms are at hazard
here. Our lives, our names, our honor. This is no game we're playing
for your amusement.&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>ADWD - Tyrion III</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two combatant Griffins (Winged Lions with heads of Eagles) are sigil of House Connington. Griff's reaction pretty much confirmed what Tyrion thought. Now the question was, what is Rhaegar's friend Jon Connington doing with this company?</p>
<h3>Boy with Purple hair</h3>
<p>Now the other interesting companion was the Griff's son.</p>
<p>He told Tyrion that his mother was a Tyroshi. As she was dead, in her memory, he dies his hair in fashion of the Tyroshi people. He had purple eyes.</p>
<p>The Boy was too gentle-spoken and well-bred for a sell-sword's son.</p>
<p>The most interesting bits were the training he received.</p>
<p>Be it the martial training:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the bacon was gone, Duck punched Young Griff in the shoulder.
&quot;Time to raise some bruises. Swords today, I think.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Swords?&quot; Young Griff grinned. &quot;Swords will be sweet.&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>ADWD - Tyrion IV</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or Theological training:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whilst Young Griff went off with Septa Lemore to be instructed in the
mysteries of the Faith, Tyrion stripped off the wet clothes and donned
dry ones.<br><sub><em><strong>ADWD - Tyrion IV</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or the lessons in History, Languages, Geometry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The lesson began with languages.</strong> Young Griff spoke the Common Tongue as if he had been born to it, and was fluent in High Valyrian,
the low dialects of Pentos, Tyrosh, Myr, and Lys, and the trade talk
of sailors. The Volantene dialect was as new to him as it was to
Tyrion, so every day they learned a few more words whilst Haldon
corrected their mistakes. Meereenese was harder; its roots were
Valyrian as well, but the tree had been grafted onto the harsh, ugly
tongue of Old Ghis. &quot;You need a bee up your nose to speak Ghiscari
properly,&quot; Tyrion complained. Young Griff laughed, but the Halfmaester
only said, &quot;Again.&quot; The boy obeyed, though he rolled his eyes along
with his zzzs this time. He has a better ear than me, Tyrion was
forced to admit, though I'll wager my tongue is still more nimble.</p>
<p><strong>Geometry followed languages</strong>. There the boy was less adroit, but Haldon was a patient teacher, and Tyrion was able to make himself of
use as well. He had learned the mysteries of squares and circles and
triangles from his father's maesters at Casterly Rock, and they came
back more quickly than he would have thought.</p>
<p>By the time <strong>they turned to history</strong>, Young Griff was growing
restive.<br><sub><em><strong>ADWD - Tyrion IV</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was all common training for Highborn Sons of Aristocrats, but for son of a Sell-sword this was unheard of. Even for a Westerosi Noble, the training was rather excessive. Tyrion noted as much in front of Haldon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tyrion watched with mismatched eyes, and said, &quot;The boy is bright.
<strong>You have done well by him. Half the lords in Westeros are not so learned, sad to say. Languages, history, songs, sums … a heady stew
for some sellsword's son.</strong>&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>ADWD - Tyrion IV</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tyrion by now knew that the boy had his own secret like everyone else in this interesting company.</p>
<p>But Tyrion needed to be sure. But who could he ask? Opportunity presented itself when Tyrion challenged Haldon for a game of Cyvasse and the latter agreed to play for secrets:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I have no coin. We'll play for secrets.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Griff would cut my tongue out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Afraid, are you? I would be if I were you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>The day you defeat me at cyvasse will be the day turtles crawl out my</strong>
<strong>arse</strong>.&quot; The Halfmaester moved his spears. &quot;You have your wager, little
man.&quot;</p>
<p>Tyrion stretched a hand out for his dragon.<br><sub><em><strong>ADWD - Tyrion IV</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tyrion won this game of Secrets after three hours:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>It was three hours later when the little man finally crept back up on deck to empty his bladder</strong>. Duck was helping Yandry wrestle down
the sail, while Ysilla took the tiller. The sun hung low above the
reed-beds along the western bank, as the wind began to gust and rip. I
need that skin of wine, the dwarf thought. His legs were cramped from
squatting on that stool, and he felt so light-headed that he was lucky
not to fall into the river.</p>
<p>&quot;Yollo,&quot; Duck called. &quot;<strong>Where's Haldon?</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>He's taken to his bed, in some discomfort. There are turtles
crawling out his arse.</strong>&quot; He left the knight to sort that out and
crawled up the ladder to the cabin roof. Off to the east, there was
darkness gathering behind a rocky island.<br><sub><em><strong>ADWD - Tyrion IV</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is never told what secrets did Tyrion win from Haldon, but whatever they were, they were enough to confirm his doubts because by the end of that chapter, this happened:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What was the cause of all that noise?&quot; the Halfmaester asked.</p>
<p>&quot;A turtle,&quot; said Tyrion. &quot;A turtle bigger than this boat.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was him,&quot; cried Yandry. &quot;The Old Man of the River.&quot;</p>
<p>And why not? <strong>Tyrion grinned. Gods and wonders always appear, to
attend the birth of kings.</strong><br><sub><em><strong>ADWD - Tyrion IV</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, Haldon still did not explicitly confirm Tyrion's doubts.</p>
<p>Of course, afterwards, in the chaos of Stonemen attack, Lemore's tongue slipped but by then Tyrion knew all he needed to know.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Young Griff gave his father a stubborn look. &quot;Lemore knows where her
cabin is. I want to stay.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>We are sworn to protect you</strong>,&quot; Lemore said softly.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't need to be protected. I can use a sword as well as Duck. I'm
half a knight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And half a boy,&quot; said Griff. &quot;Do as you are told. Now.&quot;</p>
<p>The youth cursed under his breath and flung his pole down onto the
deck. The sound echoed queerly in the fog, and for a moment it was as
if poles were falling around them. &quot;Why should I run and hide? Haldon
is staying, and Ysilla. Even Hugor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aye,&quot; said Tyrion, &quot;but I'm small enough to hide behind a duck.&quot; He
thrust half a dozen torches into the brazier's glowing coals and
watched the oiled rags flare up. Don't stare at the fire, he told
himself. The flames would leave him night blind.</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>You're a dwarf</strong>,&quot; Young Griff said scornfully.</p>
<p>&quot;My secret is revealed,&quot; Tyrion agreed. &quot;Aye, I'm less than half of
Haldon, and no one gives a mummer's fart whether I live or die.&quot; Least
of all me. &quot;<strong>You, though … you are everything.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dwarf,&quot; said Griff, &quot;I warned you—&quot;</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Tyrion had no sooner exhaled than Young Griff grabbed hold of his arm.
&quot;What do you mean? I am everything? What did you mean by that? <strong>Why
am I everything?</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why,&quot; said Tyrion, &quot;<strong>if the stone men had taken Yandry or Griff or
our lovely Lemore, we would have grieved for them and gone on. Lose
you, and this whole enterprise is undone, and all those years of
feverish plotting by the cheesemonger and the eunuch will have been
for naught</strong> … isn't that so?&quot;</p>
<p>The boy looked to Griff. &quot;He knows who I am.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>If I did not know before, I would now.</strong><br><sub><em><strong>ADWD - Tyrion V</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tyrion thought this was as good a time as any to confess that he knew:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dwarf ignored him. &quot;<strong>The blue hair makes your eyes seem blue,
that's good</strong>. And the tale of how you color it in honor of your dead
Tyroshi mother was so touching it almost made me cry. <strong>Still, a
curious man might wonder why some sellsword's whelp would need a
soiled septa to instruct him in the Faith, or a chainless maester to
tutor him in history and tongues. And a clever man might question why
your father would engage a hedge knight to train you in arms</strong> instead
of simply sending you off to apprentice with one of the free
companies. It is almost as if <strong>someone wanted to keep you hidden
whilst still preparing you for … what?</strong> Now, there's a puzzlement,
but I'm sure that in time it will come to me. I must admit, <strong>you have
noble features for a dead boy</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>The boy flushed. &quot;I am not dead.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How not? <strong>My lord father wrapped your corpse in a crimson cloak</strong> and
laid you down beside your sister at the foot of the Iron Throne, his
gift to the new king. Those who had the stomach to lift the cloak said
that half your head was gone.&quot;</p>
<p>Young Griff hesitated. &quot;Lannister? Your father—&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;—is dead. At my hand. If it please Your Grace to call me Yollo or
Hugor, so be it, but know that I was born Tyrion of House Lannister,
trueborn son of Tywin and Joanna, both of whom I slew. Men will tell
you that I am a kingslayer, a kinslayer, and a liar, and all of that
is true … but then, w<strong>e are a company of liars, are we not? Take your
feigned father. Griff, is it?</strong>&quot; The dwarf sniggered.  &quot;You should
thank the gods that Varys the Spider is a part of this plot of yours.
Griff would not have fooled the cockless wonder for an instant, no
more than it did me. <strong>No lord, my lordship says, no knight. And I'm
no dwarf. Just saying a thing does not make it true. Who better to
raise Prince Rhaegar's infant son than Prince Rhaegar's dear friend
Jon Connington, once Lord of Griffin's Roost and Hand of the King?</strong>&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>ADWD - Tyrion V</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The King whose birth Tyrion was witnessing was Aegon, of House Targaryen, sixth of his name. He figured it out because:</p>
<ol>
<li>No Sellsword's son receives the kind of education Young Griff received</li>
<li>The Sellsword was not who he said he was. If he was who Tyrion suspected him to be, then who was the young boy with him?</li>
<li>Haldon helped him some presumably.</li>

"169622","Are the Faceless Men and the Iron Bank connected?","<p>It occurred to me that both the Iron Bank and the Faceless Men hail from the city of Braavos. </p>

<p>It is mentioned once or twice in the books that the Iron bank has funded wars for Kings and Queens in past struggles for power. </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>This is further recently acknowledged in Season 7 of the show with Cersei's hire of the Golden Company with money borrowed from the Iron Bank.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The assassins known as the Faceless Men have also been used for various political reasons. They are even considered for the assassination of Daenerys. One of the primary reasons they were not used was due to the cost.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""On Braavos there is a society called the Faceless Men,"" Grand Maester Pycelle offered.</p>
  
  <p>""Do you have any idea how costly they are?"" Littlefinger complained. ""You could hire an army of common sellswords for half the price, and that's for a merchant. I don't dare think what they might ask for a princess.""</p>
  
  <p><sub>A Game of Thrones - Eddard VIII</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>With both of these things in mind, is there anything that suggests that the Iron Bank and the Faceless Men are connected in any way? I suspect that the Iron Bank may have gained their wealth through the earnings of the Faceless Men and enforce the debts they are owed through them.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","169628","<p><strong>There is no evidence that supports this theory, both in the books or in the show.</strong></p>

<p>These two organizations without a doubt are based on the same Free City, but besides that, there is nothing that could suggest a direct involvement of one in the activities of the other.</p>

<p>The simple fact that their businesses, directly or indirectly, concern large sums of gold, is not a proof that they share common interests or that they are associates an any way: other banks are known to exist in the other Free Cities as well, and even some Great Houses in Westeros, mainly the Lannisters of course, but also the Tyrells, are known to be very wealty.<br>
This does not mean that the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Iron_Bank_of_Braavos"" rel=""noreferrer"">Iron Bank</a>, all the other banks, the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Faceless_Men"" rel=""noreferrer"">Faceless Men</a>, the Lannisters and the Tyrells all together are something of a single ""cartel"", just because they are rich.</p>

<p>Of course nothing prevents any of these parties to do business with the other (like in example, Lannisters borrowing money from the Iron Bank), so it is <em>possible</em> that the Iron Bank employs the service of the Faceless Men on the more desperate cases, but it seems that a usually it is sufficient for them to act against their debtors by supporting their enemies:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tycho Nestoris had impressed him as cultured and courteous, but the Iron Bank of Braavos had a fearsome reputation when collecting debts. Each of the Nine Free Cities had its bank, and some had more than one, fighting over every coin like dogs over a bone, but the Iron Bank was richer and more powerful than all the rest combined. <strong>When princes defaulted on their debts to lesser banks, ruined bankers sold their wives and children into slavery and opened their own veins. When princes failed to repay the Iron Bank, new princes sprang up from nowhere and took their thrones.</strong><br>

<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/The_World_of_Ice_%26_Fire"" rel=""noreferrer"">The World of Ice &amp; Fire</a> give more details about the birth of the Iron Bank, ruling out any involvement of the Faceless Men:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Braavos is also home to one of the most powerful banks in the world, whose roots stretch back to the beginnings of the city, when a few of the fugitives took to <strong>hiding such valuables as they had in an abandoned iron mine to keep them safe from thieves and pirates. As the city grew and prospered, the shafts and chambers of the mine began to fill. Rather than let their treasure sit idle in the earth, the wealthier Braavosi began to make loans to their less fortunate brethren.</strong><br>
  Thus was born the Iron Bank of Braavos, whose renown (or infamy, to hear some tell it) now extends to every corner of the known world. Kings, princes, archons, triarchs, and merchants beyond count travel from the ends of the earth to seek loans from the heavily guarded vaults of the Iron Bank.<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice and Fire - The Free Cities: Braavos</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are also details of the current management:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Archmaester Matthar's The Origins of the Iron Bank and Braavos provides one of the more detailed accounts of the bank's history and dealings, so far as they can be discovered; the bank is famous for its discretion and its secrecy. <strong>Matthar recounts that the founders of the Iron Bank numbered three-and-twenty; sixteen men and seven women, each of whom possessed a key to bank's great subterranean vaults. Their descendants, whose numbers now exceed one thousand, are known as keyholders to this day, though the keys they display proudly on formal occasions are now entirely ceremonial.</strong> Certain of the founding families of Braavos have declined over the centuries, and a few have lost their wealth entirely, yet even the meanest still cling to their keys and the honors that go with them.<br>
  <strong>The Iron Bank is not ruled by the keyholders alone, however. Some of the wealthiest and most powerful families in Braavos today are of more recent vintage, yet the heads of these houses own shares in the bank, sit on its secret councils, and have a voice in selecting the men who lead it. In Braavos, as many an outsider has observed, golden coins count for more than iron keys.</strong> The bank's envoys cross the world, oft upon the bank's own ships, and merchants, lords, and even kings treat with them almost as equals.<br>

"33427","What does this passage in A Feast for Crows mean?","<p>In the chapter ""The Reaver"" (Victarion), in <em>A Feast for Crows</em>, there is the following passage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>He shames Hewett as he once shamed me</em>, the captain thought, remembering how his wife had sobbed as he was beating her. The men of the Four Shields oft married one another, he knew, as the ironborn did. One of the naked serving wenches might well be Talbert Serry's wife. It was one thing to kill a foe, another to dishonor him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't really get what the meaning of ""The men of the Four Shields oft married one another, he knew, as the ironborn did."" is in this context. Firstly, I assume by ""men"" he means ""people"" (not ""males""), as it doesn't make sense in this context.</p>

<p>""Married one another"" could mean incest, which again doesn't make much sense here. Besides, there has been no previous mention about homosexuality or incest in the context of the ironborn. The only thing that makes sense here is that ""the people of the Four Shields often married one another"", where ""one another"" is just ""other people who live in the Four Shields area"", which doesn't make much sense here either (it's obvious -- most marriages are with people who live nearby).</p>

<p>So, what does this passage mean? </p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","33432","<p>I believe he <em>does</em> mean people, not men.  The specific passage refers to Euron stripping Lord Hewett's wife and her retinue, after forcing them to act as serving wenches (well, more specifically, stripping them <em>while</em> they are acting as serving wenches):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The serving wenches wore fine woolens and plush velvets, the Lord Captain did not fail to note. He took them for scullions dressed up in the clothes of Lady Hewett and her ladies, until Hotho told him they were Lady Hewett and her ladies. It amused the Crow's Eye to make them wait and pour. There were eight of them: her ladyship herself, still handsome though grown somewhat stout, and seven younger women aged from twenty-five to ten, her daughters and good-daughters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, in the context of ""One of the naked serving wenches might well be Talbert Serry's wife"", he is saying that Serry may very well have married one of Hewett's daughters or good-daughters.</p>

<p>When he says ""the men of Four Shields oft married one another"", he apparently means that the families of one of the Shield Islands often marry those from another one of the Islands (e.g. Serry, from Southshield, may very well have married a Hewett, from Oakenshield), and therefore Euron's shaming of Hewett's family may also include the shaming of the family of a warrior that Victarion had bested in honorable combat.</p>

<p>The ""men of Four Shields"" part could specifically indicate the noble families ruling each island (i.e. the Serrys of Southshield, the the Chesters of Greenshield, the Hewetts of Oakenshield, and the Grimms of Greyshield), although I don't believe this is spelled out.</p>

<p>Victarion is not a nice man, but he is honorable, and respects those who fight him honorably, so Euron's actions do not sit well with him (even before you factor in the personal issues he has with Euron from the incident with Victarion's wife).</p>
"
"169868","Population of Iron Islands?","<p>We know that Iron Islands has a huge navy. It is their main strength. We also know that Iron Islands are barren land, very small and even if they fish extensively, it should not support a population as great as the North. In fact, it was one of their motives when they waged war against the North, to obtain <em>Lebensraum</em> for their people.</p>

<p>I am not really shocked with their ship building efficiency. They might steal the wood easily from many unprotected forests in the North or in the Riverlands. The Iron Fleet should already have around 500 ships in total. Building 500 more in one or two years for a seafarer nation should not be the greatest challenge.</p>

<p>However, for such a small nation to man even 500 ships efficiently puzzles me. In a world where the North can muster 20000 men (if they took their time it would at most be 40000), how did Iron Islands man 1000 ships? What would be the crew per ship?</p>

<p>One of the best comparisons I could find is the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Taking_of_Deepwood_Motte"" rel=""noreferrer"">taking of Deepwood Motte</a>, where Asha Greyjoy commaned 30 longships and about 1000 men, making it about 30 men per ship. <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Fight_by_Deepwood_Motte"" rel=""noreferrer"">Battle for Deepwood Motte</a> is another possible reference point, where it is claimed that Asha Greyjoy had 4 longships and 200 men. This makes 50 men per longship.</p>

<p>So, how can Iron Islands support a fighting population of 30000 while the best North can do is 40000?</p>

<p>Book answers are preferred but TV show answers are also welcome.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","169880","<p>The true answer is we do not know the exact size of the Iron Islands population and so it seems appropriate to use @Aegon's image here:</p>

<p>However, the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Iron_Islands"" rel=""noreferrer"">awoiaf page on the Iron Islands</a> cites that they have 20,000 men and 500 longships which in turn is cited from ""A Game of Thrones: d20-based Open Gaming RPG."" which is a semi-canon source. </p>

<p>We can also get a figure of 15,000 fighting men from <a href=""https://atlasoficeandfireblog.wordpress.com/2016/03/06/the-population-of-the-seven-kingdoms/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this post on atlasoficeandfireblog</a> which is cited from this video by Elio Garcia:</p>

            </div></div></p>

<p>From there the article extrapolates that the Iron Islands has a population of 1.5 million but that is using a basis that the fighters make up 1% of the population which seems low for a nation such as the Ironborn. Using a figure more around 10% we get 150,000 which seems more reasonable. This isn't exactly unfeasible as in WWII many nations managed to get around 10% fighting population although it isn't sustainable but these are times of war for Westeros.</p>

<p>So using both figures for fighting men and a rough estimate of between 1-10% of the population being fighters we get a population between 150,000 and 2,000,000 though it seems likely to be on the lower side of things.</p>

<p>However, in my opinion (especially as they rely on raiding), the percentage of fighting men is likely around 3-5% maybe a bit higher which gives a total population of between 450,000 and 1,000,000.</p>

"33604","Why does Cersei have to be defended by a knight of the Kingsguard?","<p>When Qyburn first brings news to Cersei of an invincible champion they agree that as queen she must be defended by a knight of the Kingsguard. Why? At this point Tommen has already married Margaery Tyrell so he is the king and she is the queen, not Cersei. Cersei is arguably still Queen Regent but, after her imprisonment and confession, Ser Kevan becomes King Regent so there is no interpretation at all by which she is still the queen. And yet everyone seems to still think she can only be defended by a Kingsguard member and so needs Ser Robert Strong appointed.</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","37695","<p>Ser Kevan becomes <em>Lord</em> Regent, not <em>King</em>. That would also have been Eddard Stark's position if... well... you know. That is, the ""Queen/Lord"" and ""Regent"" parts are independent.</p>

<p>However, another part to the question is ""Why must a Queen be championed by a member of the Kingsguard in case of a trial by combat?"" - remember that in ASOS, Cersei was championed by Gregor Clegane, who was not a member of the Kingsguard at that time.</p>

<p>That comes down to Cersei's plan to ensure Margaery's condamnation: in order to prevent Margaery from being innocented by a trial by combat, she arranged that only Kingsguard members with passable swordsmanship (Blount, Trant) or strong unsuitability (Kettleblack) would be present and healthy in King's Landing, and she arranged with the High Septon that the Queen could only be championed in a trial by combat by a member of the Kingsguard. Little did she know that the High Septon intended to apply every provision put forward by Cersei for Margaery's trial to Cersei's own.</p>

"169891","Which realm in Westeros had the best archers?","<p>In <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, great emphasis is put on the martial prowess of many characters, <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/168630/83101"">especially about swordsmanship</a> and other melee weapons.<br>
The reason, probably, is that nearly all the main characters are of noble birth, and, considering the strong influences of our own Medieval History on this series, this is not surprising: the sword is the main weapon of a knight and a noble, and even a symbol of knighthood itself.</p>

<p>Even the <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Military_strength"" rel=""noreferrer"">composition of armies</a> seems to be described more on terms of knights and footsoldiers, we hear relatively less about archers.</p>

<p>The Raven's teeth are the largest regiment of archers we come to meet. Being loyal to the crown and Bloodraven's personal escort, they were based in King's Landing in the Crownlands. The extent to which their makeup was from the Crownlands is unknown, but we can guess that many would be from lesser houses in the Crownlands, and not necessarily from other realms (as those Lord would likely keep good archers to themselves). This force was 500 men strong during the First Blackfyre Rebellion at the Redgrass field. At the Second Blackfyre rebellion, Bloodraven only took part of his escort to Whitewalls, which consisted of 300 Raven's Teeth. And finally as noted below, a portion of the Raven's Teeth went with Brynden Rivers when he was sent to the wall, this group included 200 men.</p></li>

<li><p>The Lannisters</p>

<p>They're said to have foot archers (3 lines worth) led by Kevan Lannister. What types of bows they used is unknown.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>His uncle would lead the center. Ser Kevan had raised his standards above the kingsroad. Quivers hanging from their belts, the foot archers arrayed themselves into three long lines, to east and west of the road, and stood calmly stringing their bows.</p>

<li><p>The Golden Company</p>

<p>I won't go into extensive detail here as I don't want to be accused for stealing an answer that was posted below. (Although the relevant quotes can be found under ""Black Balaq"") The Golden company contained 1000 archers led by Black Balaq, a third of which were Westerosi born. Although they are currently in the Stormlands and as of <em>The Winds of Winter</em> have taken Storm's End, they were trained in the Free Cities and not in Westeros and therefore can't be counted amongst the best ""trained"" archers of a realm in Westeros.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Quality of equipment</h2>

<p>The longest range bows in <em>Planetos</em> are Dragonbone, ""greatly prized by the Dothraki"" followed by those of the Goldenheart tree, used by the Summer Islanders.</p>

<p>However we care about westeros, where the only bows that seems to get mentioned are Dornish yew Longbows, used by the Westerosi in the Golden Company, and those made of Weirwood, as used by Bryden Rivers and Ygritte. Dorne and the North therefore seem to be the most equipt for making the best bows.</p>

<p><hr>
What we do know is there were some great archers (in the Seven Kingdoms), and we know where they were from. Since we don't know for a fact which realm was the best, I've decided to look at individual archers (of great renown or skill) and see where they came from and how those add up.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That afternoon a boy named Anguy, an unheralded commoner from the Dornish Marches, won the archery competition, outshooting Ser Balon Swann and Jalabhar Xho at a hundred paces after all the other bowmen had been eliminated at the shorter distances. Ned sent Alyn to seek him out and offer him a position with the Hand's guard, but the boy was flush with wine and victory and riches undreamed of, and he refused.<br>

  <p>As they waded across, their singing flushed a duck from among the reeds. Anguy stopped where he stood, unslung his bow, notched an arrow, and brought it down. The bird fell in the shallows not far from the bank.<br>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Planetos</strong>

<ul>
<li>Summer Islands (4)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>From the above tables. We can see that the Stormlands has produced the most talent, of which the Dornish Marches (part of the Stormlands and the Reach) were the key provider of skill. Dorne proper, however only produced one renowned archer, as did various other realms. Considering we have 4 unknowns, any of the realms could take the top spot and be the greatest. So I'm going to conclude with a bit of conjecture, but considering the Summer Islanders did trade with Westeros from before the first men, and Landed at Old Town and King's Landing, it is likely their trade was taught around nearby southern ports. Leading on to my additional bit.</p>

<p>Finally, the Summer Islands are infamous for their archery, although they are not part of Westeros and the Seven Kingdoms, they are known for their great skill with a goldenheart bow and producing bows which are second only in range to those made of dragonbone.</p>

<p>List of things I plan to work on:
 - More on Lannister forces, the Night's Watch and the Bog Devils.
 - Possibly revised list of Archers and a better explanation of what it means.
 - Evaluating the history of Archery (if any) in Westeros.
 - More on the Summer Islanders, Ghiscari, Dothraki and other Essosi and Sothyrosi archers.</p>

<p>Also, that whole scene is a cluster fudge. It's a snow storm, and people go bare-headed. (Yeah, you can tell people from sunny California wrote this script.) Ghost is there, and not with Jon. The wight used an axe. Sam didn't send off the birds (in the books he sent off <em>all</em> the birds). So, take it with a grain of salt, perhaps.</p>

<p>Why are they afraid of white walkers? I don't know that they are. Where did you get that impression?

The white walkers have not been seen for thousands of years, and people have forgotten. </p>

Was it the same woman? I understand that Rhaegar was much older than the other two, a fully-grown man when he died fighting Robert Baratheon. At which time, Viserys was a boy, and Daenerys was not yet born. Why such large age gaps? What are their relative ages?</p>

<p>For comparison, the contemporary Stark children are ages 14 (Rob), 11 (Sansa), 9 (Arya), 7 (Bran), 3 (Rickon). A difference of 11 years between 5 children.</p>

  <p>What became of the dream of dragons was a grievous tragedy born in a moment of joy. In the fateful year 259 AC, the king summoned many of those closest to him to Summerhall, his favorite castle, there to celebrate <strong>the impending birth of his first great-grandchild, a boy later named Rhaegar, to his grandson Aerys and granddaughter Rhaella</strong>, the children of Prince Jaehaerys.<br>

<blockquote>
  <p>His Grace's new fidelity was apparently pleasing to the Mother Above, it must be said, for the following year, <strong>Queen Rhaella gave the king the second son that he had prayed for. Prince Viserys, born in 276 AC</strong>, was small but robust, and as beautiful a child as King's Landing had ever seen. Though Prince Rhaegar at seventeen was everything that could be wanted in an heir apparent, all Westeros rejoiced to know that at last he had a brother, another Targaryen to secure the succession.<br>

<p><strong>Daenerys Targaryen</strong></p>

<p>I wasn't able to find an explicit quote proving that Daenerys was born to Rhaella but seeing as Viserys never forgave her about her mothers death it implies she has the same mother.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She had been born on Dragonstone nine moons after their flight, while a raging summer storm threatened to rip the island fastness apart. They said that storm was terrible. The Targaryen fleet was smashed while it lay at anchor, and huge stone blocks were ripped from the parapets and sent hurtling into the wild waters of the narrow sea. <strong>Her mother had died birthing her, and for that her brother Viserys had never forgiven her.</strong><br>

<p>For working out Daenery's age is ab bit complicated but <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/174689/58193"">I have an answer on it here</a> which concludes that she was born in 284 AC. This would then make Daenerys 16 in 300 AC.</p>

<p><sub>Disclaimer: 300 AC was picked only because it made the maths easier and no other reason than that.</sub></p>

<hr>

<p>As for why there are such large age gaps well Rhaella had a lot of trouble giving birth with some stillborns and some dying not long after being born. Also Aerys is said to have slept around a lot so his <em>attention</em> was not always on his wife which may have caused problems.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sadly, the marriage between Aerys II Targaryen and his sister, Rhaella, was not as happy; though she turned a blind eye to most of the king's infidelities, the queen did not approve of his ""turning my ladies into his whores."" (Joanna Lannister was not the first lady to be dismissed abruptly from Her Grace's service, nor was she the last). Relations between the king and queen grew even more strained when <strong>Rhaella proved unable to give Aerys any further children. Miscarriages in 263 and 264 were followed by a stillborn daughter born in 267. Prince Daeron, born in 269, survived for only half a year.

Not long after, in a change of heart, Aerys announced that Jaehaerys had been poisoned by his own mistress, the pretty young daughter of one of his household knights.

<h3>Aemon Steelsong</h3>
<p>Aemon Steelsong was son of Mance Rayder and his Queen Dalla. Mance was a deserter from Night's Watch so their son would fall under the category of children sired by Black brothers after taking their oath.</p>
<h3>&quot;Digging for the treasures&quot;</h3>
<p>Black Brothers aren't entirely lost to feminine charms. As Iron Emmett, the Pride of East Watch said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Iron Emmett grimaced. &quot;Men are men, vows are words, and words are
wind.&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>ADWD- Jon VII</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many of them frequent brothels such as Mole Town so naturally there would be a number of Black Bastards running around in Mole's Town although none are mentioned specifically IIRC. It's only logical that If a certain number of Black brothers are wenching, there's bound to be some fruits of that copulation. There's a proper term for it on the Wall, they call it &quot;digging for treasures&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ghost loped ahead of them. The grounds seemed deserted this morning,
with so <strong>many rangers off at the brothel in Mole's Town, digging for</strong>
<strong>buried treasure</strong> and drinking themselves blind. Grenn had gone with
them. Pyp and Halder and Toad had offered to buy him his first woman
to celebrate his first ranging. They'd wanted Jon and Sam to come as
well, but Sam was almost as frightened of whores as he was of the
haunted forest, and Jon had wanted no part of it. &quot;Do what you want,&quot;
he told Toad, &quot;I took a vow.&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>ACOK- Jon I</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it must be noted that Mole Town is frequented only by Castle Black men. It is unknown if their comrades stationed at Eastwatch or Shadow Tower have similar establishments nearby.</p>
<h3>Punishment for breaking the vows of celibacy</h3>
<p>You are correct they are breaking their vows. It is unknown what punishment did the Night's Watch of the old pass for such oath breakers but now, with the strength very much dwindled, it appears that Lord Commanders and Castle Commanders turn a blind eye to these minor breaches of their oath.</p>
<p>We have one example when Jon tried to desert his post to fight beside Robb but was brought back by his friends.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jon stood tall. He told himself that he would die well; that much he
could do, at the least. &quot;<strong>I know the penalty for desertion, my lord.
I'm not afraid to die.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nor live, I hope,&quot; Mormont said, cutting his ham with a dagger and
feeding a bite to the bird. &quot;You have not deserted—yet. Here you
stand. <strong>If we beheaded every boy who rode to Mole's Town in the
night, only ghosts would guard the Wall</strong>. Yet maybe you mean to flee
again on the morrow, or a fortnight from now. Is that it? Is that your
hope, boy?&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>AGOT- Jon IX</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now of course, Desertion is still a breach which is not dealt with kindness or benign negligence by the Watch, contrary to how they treat breach of celibacy vows. So here, it looks like Lord Commander was going to treat it as if Jon had gone to dig for the treasures. But it is not explicitly mentioned, this is just how you can interpret it. Alternatively, it could be just that Lord Commander was going to pretend that Jon had gone for ride to get some air.</p>
<p>Jon was however a firmer Lord Commander when his turn came. Few Black brothers mistook the Tower housing Wildling women for a brothel and Jon locked them in ice cells.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Hardin's Tower.&quot; Of the sixty-three who had come back with him from
Mole's Town, nineteen had been women and girls. Jon had housed them in
the same abandoned tower where he had once slept when he had been new
to the Wall. Twelve were spearwives, more than capable of defending
both themselves and the younger girls from the unwanted attentions of
black brothers. It was some of the men they'd turned away who'd given
Hardin's Tower its new, inflammatory name. Jon was not about to
condone the mockery. <strong>&quot;Three drunken fools mistook Hardin's for a
brothel, that's all. They are in the ice cells now, contemplating
their mistake.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Iron Emmett grimaced. &quot;Men are men, vows are words, and words are
wind. You should put guards around the women.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And who will guard the guards?&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>ADWD- Jon VII</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But admittedly Jon was dealing with attempted rape by the looks of it, something which even previous Lord Commanders wouldn't have tolerated. Mole's Town Women were different, it was consensual business between adults.</p>
<p>We however have example of punishment from a similar order with similar vows. The Kingsguard swear similar vows of celibacy. One of them, Ser Lucamore the Lusty was gelded and sent to the Wall for breaking his vows of celibacy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Yes, and what of Lucamore the Lusty, with his three wives and sixteen
children? The song always makes me laugh.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The truth is not so funny. He was never called Lucamore the Lusty
whilst he lived. His name was Ser Lucamore Strong, and his whole life
was a lie. <strong>When his deceit was discovered, his own Sworn Brothers</strong>
<strong>gelded him, and the Old King sent him to the Wall</strong>. Those sixteen
children were left weeping. He was no true knight, no more than
Terrence Toyne . . .&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>AFFC- The Soiled Knight</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another Ser Terrence Toyne was executed for breaking his vows with King's own mistress.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And Ser Terrence Toyne?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Bedded the king's mistress and died screaming</strong>. The lesson is, men who
wear white breeches need to keep them tightly laced.&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>AFFC- Jaime II</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that doesn't mean that Kingsguard is as perfect as Singers say. Many of them are no strangers to Street of Silk and some like Prince Lewyn had their own proper paramours. None were punished or tried.</p>
<p>So speculating, it appears that guilty members:</p>
<ol>
<li>May be gelded</li>
<li>May be executed</li>
<li>May be left alone</li>
</ol>
<p>All of these things depend on the temperament of the Commander and needs of the order.</p>

<p>How did she disappoint Tywin?</p>

<p>From what I can guess it could be Genna's promiscuity:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was hard not to feel contemptuous of Emmon Frey. He had arrived at
  Casterly Rock in his fourteenth year to wed a lioness half his age.
  Tyrion used to say that Lord Tywin had given him a nervous belly for a
  wedding gift. Genna has played her part as well. <strong>Jaime remembered
  many a feast where Emmon sat poking at his food sullenly whilst his
  wife made ribald jests with whatever household knight had been seated
  to her left, their conversations punctuated by loud bursts of
  laughter. She gave Frey four sons, to be sure. At least she says they
  are his</strong>. No one in Casterly Rock had the courage to suggest
  otherwise, least of all Ser Emmon.<br><sub><strong><em>AFFC - Jaime V</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tywin disapproved of such behavior and he would be very disappointed if he found a lioness of the Rock consorting with household Knights. </p>

<p>Or it could be that Tywin expected Genna to refuse to marry Emmon Frey but she ended up being persuaded by her Lord Father (Genna evidently never wanted to marry Emmon but for some undisclosed reason she did and even after they were wed, she never liked her husband) and therefore disappointing her lord brother. I can picture Tytos begging his daughter to save his honor by agreeing to the marriage and Tywin commanding her to protect the honor of the House by refusing. After all, on the wedding day, it was <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/169151/54887"">her choice that mattered</a>, especially since her father was a weak man. If she chose her Father's honor, that would have disappointed her brother. Tywin was only ten when he objected to the betrothal, I doubt he would have given up without a fight when he was older and betrothal was turning into reality. But his sister choosing her father would put an end to any of his efforts.</p>

<p>She also angered Tywin once by saying that Tyrion was his true son, making him so angry that he didn't speak to her for half a year but I don't see how could that disappoint Tywin. </p>

<p>Has George ever commented on that other than ""<em>Keep Reading</em>""? If he hasn't, ""We do not know"" or ""No he didn't"" are perfectly valid answers.</p>

<p>We know that from a young age Tywin felt entitled to the Lordship of House Lannister and that his father, Tytos, was a useless oaf who failed to do his duties as Lord of a Great House.</p>

<p>Lets take the passage in it's entire context. (Emphasis mine)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It was not a game for girls. I was my father’s <strong>precious princess … and Tywin’s too, until I disappointed him</strong>. My brother never learned to like the taste of disappointment."" She pushed herself to her feet. “I’ve said what I came to say, I shan’t take any more of your time. Do what Tywin would have done.” </p>
  
  <p>“Did you love him?” Jaime heard himself ask. </p>
  
  <p>His aunt looked at him strangely. “I was seven when Walder Frey persuaded my lord father to give my hand to Emm. <strong>His second son</strong>, not even his heir. Father was himself a thirdborn son, and younger children crave the approval of their elders. Frey sensed that weakness in him, and Father agreed for no better reason than to please him. My betrothal was announced at a feast with half the west in attendance. <strong>Ellyn Tarbeck laughed and the Red Lion went angry from the hall.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most interesting parts have been highlighted above.</p>

<p>Let us begin with ""Precious princess"". As Joanna Lannister says, whenever GRRM uses the term ""Precious princess"" he's talking about a younger girl, this would rule out Genna's 'misdemeanour' with household knights as the cause for disappointment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Arya didn’t care about [Elmar’s] <strong>precious princess</strong>  </p>
  
  <p>Ser Arys will permit no harm to come to his <strong>precious princess</strong> </p>
  
  <p>“An ear.” Cersei stared at him, aghast. She was just a child, <strong>my precious princess</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Genna, before the attached quote above, describes each of Tywin's siblings politically, when Jamie asks about herself she states this is ""not a game for girls"". Although Genna couldn't align herself politically with Tywin, her husband would've been able to. Tywin was aware of the opporunity that stood in front of him. Genna provided an excellent tool for creating an alliance (Similar to Roberts intention with his betrothal to Lyanna, and Brandon's to Catelyn), and an alliance of greater houses could've been formed, all of this, however, was squandered by Tytos and his weakness.</p>

<p>Some believe (from the above) the Roger Reyne left the hall in anger when Genna's betrothal was announced because he had intended the wed a Reyne into the Lannister household (as he had done with Ellyn Reyne). Tywin likely knew of this or something similar and realised he could've benefited greatly from this as he would've been able to turn Genna (and in turn her husband) into a great Asset. But instead of House Reyne, Tywin ended up with a lesser son of House Frey.</p>

<p>Although Genna isn't to be blamed for this betrothal, we know that Tywin is capable of laying the blame on people who had no choice in the matter, for example, Tyrion's dwarfism besides the fact Tyrion had no control over his gene selection and birth.</p>

<p>Tywin's distaste for Emmon Frey continues onwards, this is supported in the ""rumour"" paragraph</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was hard not to feel contemptuous of Emmon Frey. He had arrived at Casterly Rock in his fourteenth year to wed a lioness half his age. Tyrion used to say that <strong>Lord Tywin had given him a nervous belly for a wedding gift. Genna has played her part as well.</strong> Jaime remembered many a feast where Emmon sat poking at his food sullenly whilst his wife made ribald jests with whatever household knight had been seated to her left, their conversations punctuated by loud bursts of laughter. She gave Frey four sons, to be sure. At least she says they are his. No one in Casterly Rock had the courage to suggest otherwise, least of all Ser Emmon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Joanna Lannister claims she has no reason to believe the sons aren't Freys, and neither do I. However, Tywin seemed to take pleasure in his abuse of Emmon Frey, and Genna aspiring to be like Tywin did the same. Tywin, and in turn Genna, seem to do what they can to ruin Emmon's life, with Tywin allowing Genna to be flirtatious with his house-hold knights, as if he'd felt this was brandishing the Lannister name, he would've ensured it ended immediately.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Tywin was aware this would have no effect on the Lannister name. Rumours that the weak Emmon was unable to control his wife, or that she'd given him horns (made a cuckold of him) would only look poor on house Frey. After House Frey weaseling their way into a marriage with a great house, Tywin ensures that he gets his revenge.</p>

<p>To conclude, <sub>as I know this isn't worded very smoothly, big text make dum dum go confused</sub> although Genna did not (necessarily<sup>1</sup>) have a choice in her betrothal, Tywin is disappointed that it went through, and although it's not her fault (entirely<sup>1</sup>), as it says above, we are aware Tywin is capable of blaming those who had no outright choice in the matter, i.e. Tyrion's birth)</p>

<p>From what I recall, there has never been a second Aenys. Targaryen Kings are:</p>

<li>Aegon I</li>
<li>Aenys I</li>
<li>Maegor</li>

<p>Note that it could be that Jaime has made a mistake, as he isn't the smartest, but he did serve Aerys II in the Kingsguard so this seems implausible.</p>

"170410","Does the moss in Westeros tend to grow on the south side of the trees?","<p>In A Storm of Swords Arya is running with Gendry through a forest and is telling the direction via the moss</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;But there's no sun. How do you know?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;From the moss. See how it grows mostly on one side of the trees? That's south.&quot;</p>
<p><em>- A Storm of Swords, Arya I</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And later</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the morning of the third day, Arya notice that the moss was growing mostly on the wrong side of the trees. &quot;We're going the wrong way,&quot; she said to Gendry, as they rode past an especially mossy elm. &quot;We're going south. See how the moss is growing on the trunk?&quot;</p>
<p><em>- A Storm of Swords, Arya III</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know that in reality moss doesn't only grow on one side of the trees, but in the northern hemisphere it tends to grow more heavily on the <em>north</em> side of the trees, as the sun is angled slightly southward due to the axial tilt of the Earth causing more shade to be on the north side of the tree. I am unfamiliar with how it grows in the southern hemisphere as I have never visited.</p>
<p>As posted in the comments <a href=""https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/questions/3062/does-moss-only-grow-on-the-north-side-of-trees"">here</a> is a link to a question about moss and which side of the tree it grows on where.</p>
<p>Since the further north you go in Westeros the colder it gets, and the south is a desert type region that is also warm, I would postulate that they are also in the northern hemisphere of their planet. As such, would the moss not then grow on the north side of their trees as well, not towards the south as Arya is suggesting?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","170454","<h1>We Do Not Know</h1>

<p>The quotes are left vague on purpose as to which side of the tree the moss is actually growing on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""From the moss. See how it grows mostly on one side of the trees? That's south.""
  <br><sub>A Storm of Swords, Arya I</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Could indicate that Arya is pointing, that she means the uncovered side is south or it's north we don't know.</p>

<p>The same can be said for your second quote. There are a couple of other quotes that are all intentionally vague as well. This one seems to indicate again that it is only mostly one side and not always just the one side:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Are you sure we're going north?"" asked Gendry. ""All these hills . . . if we got turned around . . .""
  <br>""The moss on the trees—""
  <br>He pointed to a nearby tree. ""That tree's got moss on three sides, and that next one has no moss at all. We could be lost, just riding around in a circle.""
  <br><sub>A Storm of Swords, Arya I</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only quote that tells us for definite which side the moss is growing on is the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Deepwood's mossy walls enclosed a wide, rounded hill with a flattened top, crowned by a cavernous longhall with a watchtower at one end, rising fifty feet above the hill. Beneath the hill was the bailey, with its stables, paddock, smithy, well, and sheepfold, defended by a deep ditch, a sloping earthen dike, and a palisade of logs. The outer defenses made an oval, following the contours of the land. There were two gates, each protected by a pair of square wooden towers, and wallwalks around the perimeter. <strong>On the south side of the castle, moss grew thick upon the palisade and crept halfway up the towers.</strong> To east and west were empty fields. Oats and barley had been growing there when Asha took the castle, only to be crushed underfoot during her attack. A series of hard frosts had killed the crops they'd planted afterward, leaving only mud and ash and wilted, rotting stalks.
  <br><sub>A Dance with Dragons, The Wayward Bride</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, this is on a castle and not a tree and so the south side could give more shade than the other sides or be damper etc. We don't seem to have enough information to go on.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Since the further north you go in Westeros the colder it gets, and the south is a desert type region that is also warm, I would postulate that they are also in the northern hemisphere of their planet.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We simply don't know where Westeros is on the planet so we can't just guess at that. The seasons are also different and north of the Wall the lands are always winter. By going off temperatures that change so rapidly over such a small island like Westeros it is impossible to tell where on the planet it is.</p>

"170415","What happens to the animals in winter?","<p>I recognize that there are a few discussions on here already about how humans can properly survive a multi-year winter on Planetos, but I've not yet seen one about the animals. Note that my question is totally notwithstanding the possible conversion of animals into wight-imals.  </p>

<p>Specifically, thinking of the fact that even animals in our world end up often hibernating for a few months during the worst of the winter, and all the animals able to be active in the winter are specially adapted for doing so, I'm wondering how it is that common animals such as deer and birds which are not adapted for polar conditions can find enough food and warmth to get through multiple years of winter (especially the ones that last a decade or more).  </p>

<p>Carnivores would probably have it good for a while, but I don't see herbivores lasting long without ample plant life, and carnivores won't last long without herbivores.  </p>

<p>I've read the whole series several times, and am aware of no real discussion of how wild animals manage. Perhaps something in a world book or interview? I'd prefer a book answer, but if this was mentioned in the TV show then I suppose that would be interesting as well.  </p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","170416","<p><strong>Animals likely mirgate or starve and die, much like the humans do.</strong></p>

<p>[Writer] <em>But quite a lot of people are living there. What do they eat?</em></p>
<p>[GRRM] A lot of food is stored. Smoked, salted, packed away in granaries, and so on.

And some of the great lords try and maintain greenhouses to provide for their own castles... the &quot;glass gardens&quot; of Winterfell are referred to several times.</p>
<p><strong>But the short answer is... if the winter lasts too long, the food runs out... and then people move south, or starve...</strong></p>
<p>[Writer] <em>Are there some areas without snow, which are suitable for agriculture, or are there significant temperature changes inside the &quot;bigger seasons&quot;?

<p>[GRRM] Sometimes. It is not something that can be relied on, given the random nature of the seasons, but there are &quot;false springs&quot; and &quot;spirit summers.&quot; The maesters try and monitor temperature grand closely, to advise on when to plant and when to harvest and how much food to store.</p>
<p>[Writer] <em>And what happens when a winter comes - five, six years long?</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>So we see that during the long winters that people must move south to survive or starve. This would be because the animals (the food source) has done the same. If the animals were able to survive the long winters, it would make it easier for the people who lived there as a supply of food would be more readily available.</p>

"103477","Why did Stannis join the rebellion?","<p>We know that before the story of ASOIAF begins, Robert's Rebellion has toppled the Targaryen Dynasty and crowned Robert of House Baratheon to sit on the Iron Throne.</p>

<p>Stannis is described (more so in the books than in the tv-series) as having a strong sense of justice.  He even killed his younger brother Renly because he felt it was just and right for himself to become king over his younger brother.  It also goes to show family loyalty isn't high on his values but more likely, he sees family loyalty as a just and right thing to do, unless there is a more just and right thing.</p>

<p>So my question is <strong>Why did Stannis join the rebellion?</strong></p>

<p>Should he not have sided with the Targaryen because they were the rightful rulers of Westeros?  Even if he believed what Aerys II Targaryen (the Mad King) did to trigger the Rebellion was unjust, would he not have still supported Prince Rhaegar?  Or is it more important to stay loyal to his elder brother?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","103485","<p>Ser Davos actually asks Stannis this question directly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It is every man’s duty to remain loyal to his rightful king, even if
  the lord he serves proves false,” Stannis declared in a tone that
  brooked no argument.</p>
  
  <p>A desperate folly took hold of Davos, a
  recklessness akin to madness. “As you remained loyal to King Aerys
  when your brother raised his banners?” he blurted...</p>
  
  <p>“Aerys, If you
  only knew... that was a hard choosing. My blood or my liege. My
  brother or my king.” He grimaced. “Have you ever seen the Iron Throne?
  The barbs along the back, the ribbons of twisted steel, the jagged
  ends of swords and knives all tangled up and melted? It is not a
  comfortable seat, ser. Aerys cut himself so often men took to calling
  him King Scab, and Maegor the Cruel was murdered in that chair. By
  that chair, to hear some tell it. It is not a seat where a man can
  rest at ease. Ofttimes I wonder why my brothers wanted it so
  desperately.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see, he kind of trails off towards the end. But if we assume that his musing on the difficulty of ruling, Maegor's murder, and Aerys' incompetence wasn't random, I think it gives us our answer.</p>

<p>Stannis chose Robert because he believed, first and foremost, that his duty was to the realm. Aerys insanity and paranoia tore the realm apart by murdering lords on a whim and demanding Ned and Robert's heads. His brother was a strong charismatic young man who commanded the loyalty of all who met him. In Stannis' reckoning, his oaths to Robert and Aerys equaled out, but it was Robert who was best-suited to weather the hardness of the Iron Throne.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, Stannis says several times that he does not even want the Iron Throne. The reason he wages his war is he believes that the Others will soon attack the realm, and he is the only one who can lead the Seven Kingdoms to victory. If Stannis is willing to entertain kinslaying and black magic the good of the realm, is defying a Mad King for the same reason so dishonorable?</p>

  <p>Tyrion put down Joffrey's sword and took up the other. If not twins, the two were at least close cousins.

Three fullers, deeply incised, ran down the second blade from hilt to point; the king's sword had only two. Joff's hilt was a good deal more ornate, the arms of its crossguard done as lions' paws with ruby claws unsheathed, but both swords had grips of finely tooled red leather and gold lions' heads for pommels.

  <br>""It is meant for my son.""

<p>Who then gifted it to Brienne of Tarth:</p>

  <p>Brienne approached as if the bundle was like to bite her, reached out a huge freckled hand, and flipped back a fold of cloth. Rubies glimmered in the light. She picked the treasure up gingerly, curled her fingers around the leather grip, and slowly slid the sword free of its scabbard. Blood and black the ripples shone. A finger of reflected light ran red along the edge. ""Is this Valyrian steel? I have never seen such colors.""
  <br>""Nor I. There was a time that I would have given my right hand to wield a sword like that. Now it appears I have, so the blade is wasted on me. Take it."" Before she could think to refuse, he went on. ""A sword so fine must bear a name. It would please me if you would call this one Oathkeeper. One more thing. The blade comes with a price.""

<h3>Matrilineal Marriages</h3>
<p>There is no such thing as a matrilineal marriage in Westeros.</p>
<p>Children born of a marriage can take name of either one of their parents, overwhelming majority prefers their father's name. However if it's the mother who is a landed noble and father who's a mere consort, Children take name of their mother e.g. Princes of Dornes.</p>
<p>A man can change his surname to another dynasty's if:</p>
<ol>
<li>He is married to a woman of that dynasty</li>
<li>He is descended from a woman of that dynasty</li>
</ol>
<p>For point #1, we see King Joffrey Lannister, born as Joffrey Lydden. His wife was the only daughter of King Gerold III Lannister. When Gerold died, it was Joffrey who took the throne as Joffrey Lannister by right of marriage. That's when House Lannister changed from First-Man stock to Andal stock.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In time, Lannister kings wed their children to Andals as well; indeed,
<strong>when Gerold III died without male issues, a council crowned his only daughter's husband, Ser Joffery Lydden, who took the Lannister name</strong>
and became the first Andal to rule the Rock.<br><sub><em><strong>TWOIAF - The Westerlands</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Point #2, we see examples of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Beren_Tallhart"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Beren Tallhart</a>. Beren was son of Berena Hornwood, sister to late Lord Halys Hornwood. When Lord Halys died with heir and only son therefore extinguishing House Hornwood in male line, Beren's father proposed to Winterfell that if Beren is named heir to Hornwood lands, he will take Hornwood name so that the house could continue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I will, ser,&quot; said Leobald, and only then raised the matter of Lady
Hornwood. Poor thing, with no husband to defend her lands nor son to
inherit. <strong>His own lady wife was a Hornwood, sister to the late Lord
Halys</strong>, doubtless they recalled. &quot;An empty hall is a sad one. I had a
thought to send my younger son to Lady Donella to foster as her own.
<strong>Beren is near ten, a likely lad, and her own nephew. He would cheer her, I am certain, and perhaps he would even take the name Hornwood</strong>

<p>&quot;If he were named heir?&quot; suggested Maester Luwin.</p>
<p>&quot;. . . so the House might continue,&quot; finished Leobald.<br><sub><em><strong>ACOK - Bran II</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other than facts, there are also Wilding traditions suggesting that House Stark's senior male line died long ago and current Starks are descended from a female Stark and a wildling King Bael the Bard.

The daughter was supposedly abducted by King Beyond the Wall, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bael_the_Bard"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bael the Bard</a>. Brandon was distraught because this meant extinction of House Stark. But later the girl was found with a child fathered by Bael.

"170730","Why did the show use a fancy looking Valyrian steel dagger?","<p><a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/12750/why-with-a-fancy-and-easily-recognizable-dagger/14059#14059"">This question</a> points out that the dagger in the books was actually meant to be plain:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The blade Joff chose was <strong>nice and plain. No goldwork, no jewels in the hilt, no silver inlay on the blade</strong>. King Robert never wore it, had likely forgotten he owned it. Yet the Valyrian steel was deadly sharp . . . sharp enough to slice through skin, flesh, and muscle in one quick stroke. I am no stranger to Valyrian steel. But he had been, hadn't he? Else he would never have been so foolish as to pick Littlefinger's knife.
  <br><sub>A Storm of Swords, Tyrion VIII</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, in the show the blade is obviously fancy and goes against this description.</p>

<p><div class=""youtube-embed""><div>
                <iframe width=""640px"" height=""395px"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/4nWeC2tmrHw?start=0""></iframe>
            </div></div></p>

<p>In the paragraph above Tyrion describes Joff's own dagger:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <strong>prince's own dagger had a jeweled pommel and inlaid goldwork on the blade</strong>, Tyrion seemed to recall. At least Joff had not been stupid enough to use that. Instead he went poking among his father's weapons. Robert Baratheon was a man of careless generosity, and would have given his son any dagger he wanted . . . but Tyrion guessed that the boy had just taken it. Robert had come to Winterfell with a long tail of knights and retainers, a huge wheelhouse, and a baggage train. No doubt some diligent servant had made certain that the king's weapons went with him, in case he should desire any of them.
  <br><sub>A Storm of Swords, Tyrion VIII</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that <a href=""http://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2013/06/02/swords-for-sale/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GRRM also thinks the dagger is different in the show</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A handsome blade, I think. Though rather completely different from the dagger in the books, which was far plainer (though made of Valryian steel, with a dragonbone grip).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did the show intend for the Catspaw dagger to actually be Joffery's or did they make a mistake in the props department?</p>

<p>The question is essentially: why was the dagger in the show fancy when in the books it is plain?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><adaptation-comparison>","170742","<p>I would imagine that it was simply to distinguish it from other, regular daggers.</p>

<p>The Valyrian Steel dagger is referenced many times in the first book/ season, and is the catalyst for almost every major political thing that happens until Ned's death.</p>

<p>It is used when attempting to assassinate Bran, it is used as the justification for Catelyn arresting Tyrion, Littlefinger puts it to Ned's throat just as he betrays him.</p>

<p>In the books, it is easy to describe it as a ""Valyrian Steel"" dagger, which immediately makes it special without us having to see it, yet it being plain allows for the excuse of Joffrey selecting it to order Bran's death.</p>

<p>But for these occurrences to have as much significance in the show, it really can't appear as a dagger that is just a regular dagger unless inspected closely. Otherwise it would be much harder to justify to the audience how it is so recognizable, or have as much of an emotional impact for each of these moments.</p>

<p>If I remember correctly (though I might be wrong), the issue of Tyrion tracing it back to Joffrey is not done in the same way in the show as it was in the book, i.e. realizing that it was Robert's knife and assuming that Joffrey chose it mistaking it for a normal weapon.</p>

"103692","What methods to reproduce/copy books are available in the world of Game of Thrones / ASOIAF?","<p>I am wondering what methods to reproduce or copy books are available on the work of Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire).</p>

<p>I been trying to do some research (Google, Game of Thrones wikis, this site), but with keywords like ""books"" and ""copy"" I only get results about number of copies of the series sold or printed or the like. I haven't been able to find anything reading about <em>maesters</em> or <em>The Citadel</em> on the Internet.</p>

<p>I haven't read the books, only watched the show. I wonder if this is ever addressed in the books, since George R.R. Martin's worlds tend to be pretty detailed and consistent. In the tv show this is of course not addressed at all, and apart from Sam's love for books, or Ser Davos learning to read the only other reference I can recall about books is Tyrion giving a very special tome to Joffrey for his wedding. This was supposed to be a very expensive and unique book. I don't know it if was so due to its content or due to how difficult it was to reproduce such tome.</p>

<p>Is it known (mentioned or referenced in the novels) how are all these books (re)produced? Does anything like Gutenberg's print exist in Westeros (or anywhere in the world of A Song of Ice and Fire)? Are all books copied ""by hand"" by certain people (at <em>The Citadel</em> or wherever)?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","103830","<p>Since there are no photocopiers in the world of a song of ice and fire. We can assume that copies were created by hand. There are couple of quote which indicate the same:</p>

<p>“Be gentle.” Sam came around the table and took the scroll from his hand, holding it as if it were a wounded animal. “The important books used to be copied over when they needed them. Some of the oldest have been copied half a hundred times, probably.”</p>
<p>“Well, don’t bother copying that one. Twenty-three barrels of pickled cod, eighteen jars of fish oil, a cask of salt . . .”</p>
<p>“An inventory,” Sam said, “or perhaps a bill of sale.”</p>
<p><sub><sup>A Clash of Kings, Chapter 6, Jon</sub></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>King's Landing</strong></p>
<p>There is another reference to books written by hand. This is from my favorite wedding from the series.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Your Grace,” Ser Garlan Tyrell said. “Perhaps you did not know. In all of Westeros there were but four copies of that book illuminated in Kaeth’s own hand.”</p>
<p>“Now there are three.” Joffrey undid his old swordbelt to don his new one. “You and Lady Sansa owe me a better present, Uncle Imp. This one is all chopped to pieces.”</p>

  <p>Prince Daemon was both. In his day there was not a man so admired, so

  darkness in equal parts. To some he was a hero, to others the blackest
  of villains. No true understanding of that most tragic bloodletting
  known as the Dance of the Dragons is possible without a consideration
  of the crucial role played before and during the conflict by <strong>this
  rogue prince</strong>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br></p>
  
  <p>The greatest of his rivals was <strong>our rogue prince</strong>: Daemon Targaryen,
  the king’s ambitious, impetuous younger
  brother.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br></p>
  
  <p>“Dark Sister was made for nobler tasks than slaughtering sheep,” he is
  reported to have told the Lord of the Tides. “She has a thirst for
  blood.” But it was not rebellion that <strong>the rogue prince</strong> had in
  mind; he saw another path to power.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br></p>
  
  <p>By the second moon of the year, His Grace had lost all appetite and
  was ruling the realm from his bed … when he felt strong enough to rule
  at all. On Dragonstone, meanwhile, Princess Rhaenyra was once again
  great with child. She too took to her bed, with her husband <strong>the
  rogue prince</strong> ever at her side.</p>

  end, and with that concludes this portion of our history.</p>

<h3>The Hedge Knight</h3>

<p>This prequel is a novella and has no chapter names. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sun was westering as he fed the horses. There were three; his
  swaybacked stot, the old man's palfrey, and Thunder, his warhorse, who
  was ridden only in tourney and battle. The big brown stallion was not
  as swift or strong as he had once been, but he still had his bright
  eye and fierce spirit, and he was more valuable than everything else
  Dunk owned. If I sold Thunder and old Chestnut, and the saddles and
  bridles too, I'd come away with enough silver to. . . Dunk frowned.
  The only life he knew was the life of a <strong>hedge knight</strong>, riding from
  keep to keep, taking service with this lord and that lord, fighting in
  their battles and eating in their halls until the war was done, then
  moving on. There were tourneys from time to time as well, though less
  often, and he knew that some <strong>hedge knights</strong> turned robber during
  lean winters, though the old man never
  had.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br></p>
  
  <p>I could find another <strong>hedge knight</strong> in need of a squire to tend his
  animals and clean his mail, he thought, or might be I could go to some
  city, to Jannisport or King's Landing, and join the City Watch. Or
  else . . .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br></p>
  
  <p>He had piled the old man's things under an oak. The cloth purse
  contained three silver stags, nineteen copper pennies, and a chipped
  garnet; as with <strong>most hedge knights</strong>,<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br></p>
  
  <p>Dunk was relieved. A pity I couldn't . . . but he has a good life here
  at the inn, a better one than he'd have squiring for <strong>a hedge
  knight</strong>. Taking him would be no
  kindness.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br></p>
  
  <p><strong>A hedge knight</strong> must hold tight to his pride. Without it, he was no more than a sellsword. I must earn my place in that company.
  <br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br></p>
  
  <p>He had traveled with the old man long enough to learn that merchants
  were notoriously mistrustful of <strong>hedge knights</strong>, some of whom were
  little better than robbers.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br></p>
  
  <p>""Ser,"" Dunk corrected. ""<strong>I am only a hedge knight.</strong>"" He wondered if
  the old man was looking down on him. I will teach him the arts of
  battle, the same as you taught me, ser. He seems a likely lad, might
  be one day he'll make a knight.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br></p>
  
  <p>Ser Steffon looked at him scornfully. ""<strong>The hedge knight</strong> has
  matters."" He glanced about and found another likely opponent loitering
  nearby. ""Ser Grance, well met. Come try me. I know every feeble trick
  my cousin Raymun has mastered, and it seems that Ser Duncan needs to
  return to the hedges. Come, come.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br></p>
  
  <p>That will not happen to me, Dunk vowed. I will show them that I can be
  more than a <strong>hedge knight</strong>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br></p>
  
  <p>""How can you possibly remember some insignificant <strong>hedge knight</strong> who
  chanced to unhorse Damon Lannister sixteen years ago?"" said the prince
  with the silver beard, frowning.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br></p>
  
  <p>""Why would you deign to joust with a <strong>hedge
  knight</strong>?""<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br></p>
  
  <p>What could a <strong>hedge knight</strong> dare say to such a person? ""Y-you gave
  him back his horse and armor and took no ransom, I remember,"" he
  stammered.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br></p>
  
  <p>""I did not come here to take counsel from a <strong>hedge knight</strong>,"" Prince
  Maekar declared to his brother.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br></p>
  
  <p>A <strong>hedge knight</strong> cannot challenge a prince. Valarr is second in line
  to the Iron Throne. He is Baelor Breakspear's son, and his blood is
  the blood of Aegon the Conqueror and the Young Dragon and Prince Aemon
  the Dragonknight, and I am some boy the old man found behind a pot
  shop in Flea Bottom.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br></p>
  
  <p>It would be a good day for <strong>hedge knights</strong>, for men in plain mail on
  unbarded horses.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br></p>
  
  <p>""A <strong>hedge knight</strong> is the truest kind of knight, Dunk,"" the old man
  had told him, a long long time ago.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br></p>
  
  <p>unk chewed, swallowed, and tore off some more bread. ""Why did you do

"170911","Do we ever find out who sent the catspaw after Bran in the show?","<p><a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/181067/58193"">In the books</a> we learn that Joffery Baratheon, most likely, sent the catspaw to kill Bran Stark in an attempt to impress his ""father"", Robert Baratheon. This is first worked out by Tyrion Lannister:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He remembered a cold morning when he'd climbed down the steep exterior steps from Winterfell's library to find <strong>Prince Joffrey jesting with the Hound about killing wolves</strong>. Send a dog to kill a wolf, he said. Even Joffrey was not so foolish as to command Sandor Clegane to slay a son of Eddard Stark, however; the Hound would have gone to Cersei. Instead the boy found his catspaw among the unsavory lot of freeriders, merchants, and camp followers who'd attached themselves to the king's party as they made their way north. Some poxy lackwit willing to risk his life for a prince's favor and a little coin. Tyrion wondered whose idea it had been to wait until Robert left Winterfell before opening Bran's throat. <strong>Joff's, most like</strong>. No doubt he thought it was the height of cunning.
  <br>...
  <br>The blade Joff chose was nice and plain. No goldwork, no jewels in the hilt, no silver inlay on the blade. King Robert never wore it, had likely forgotten he owned it. Yet the Valyrian steel was deadly sharp . . . sharp enough to slice through skin, flesh, and muscle in one quick stroke. <strong>I am no stranger to Valyrian steel. But he had been, hadn't he?</strong> Else he would never have been so foolish as to pick Littlefinger's knife. 
  <br>The why of it still eluded him. Simple cruelty, perhaps? His nephew had that in abundance. It was all Tyrion could do not to retch up all the wine he'd drunk, piss in his breeches, or both. He squirmed uncomfortably. He ought to have held his tongue at breakfast. The boy knows I know now. My big mouth will be the death of me, I swear it.
  <br><sub>A Storm of Swords, Tyrion VIII</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the books, as quoted above, we also learn that Joffery hadn't really known about Valyrian steel at the point he sent the catspaw. The only quote I can find in the show that resembles this, and it is a bit far-fetched, is the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Careful, Your Grace. Nothing cuts like Valyrian steel.
  <br>So they say.
  <br><sub>Game of Thrones, S04 E02, ""The Lion and the Rose""</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>With Joffery's cocky attitude it could imply that he already knows about Valyrian steel at this point although not really having come into contact with it before. Except Ice when it was taken from Ned Stark but I interpret that comment to be more aimed towards the dagger in a backward kind of way to reference the quote from Tyrion in the books.</p>

<p>Later on Jaime and Cersei Lannister also appear to come to the same conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robert? Jaime had guarded the king long enough to know that Robert Baratheon said things in his cups that he would have denied angrily the next day. ""Were you alone when Robert said this?""
  <br>""You don't think he said it to Ned Stark, I hope? Of course we were alone. Us and the children."" Cersei removed her hairnet and draped it over a bedpost, then shook out her golden curls. ""Perhaps Myrcella sent this man with the dagger, do you think so?""
  <br>It was meant as mockery, but she'd cut right to the heart of it, <strong>Jaime saw at once. ""Not Myrcella. Joffrey.""</strong>
  <br>Cersei frowned. ""Joffrey had no love for Robb Stark, but the younger boy was nothing to him. He was only a child himself.""
  <br>""A child hungry for a pat on the head from that sot you let him believe was his father."" He had an uncomfortable thought. ""Tyrion almost died because of this bloody dagger. If he knew the whole thing was Joffrey's work, that might be why . . .""
  <br><sub>A Storm of Swords, Jaime IX</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, the <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Valyrian_steel_dagger"" rel=""noreferrer"">wikia for the show</a> seems to suggest that Petyr Baelish was the one who sent the assassin:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During the trial, it is deduced that the dagger did in fact belong to Baelish all along, suggesting that he was the one who sent the catspaw assassin to kill Bran in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The quote this appears to go off of is the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You told our mother this knife belonged to Tyrion Lannister. But that was another one of your lies. <strong>It was yours.</strong>
  <br><sub>Game of Thrones, S07 E07, ""The Dragon and the Wolf""</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This appears to be a bit of a stretch and there's no actual evidence that Petyr owned the dagger beforehand, the wikia doesn't even state him in the list of owners before the catspaw. It appears as if Sansa is saying it as too add to the ""evidence"" for why Petyr is going to be given the sentence he is given. Even if the dagger was Petyr's it doesn't even mean that he sent the catspaw too.</p>

<p>So, do we ever learn who sent the catspaw?</p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","171059","<p>It appears as though the show has left it ambiguous on purpose and hasn't explicitly stated who it was so far.</p>

<p>The evidence for each of the characters is the following:</p>

<p>Cersei/Jaime Lannister:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The reason Bran is in a coma is because Jaime pushed him, maybe they sent the assassin to finish the job in case he remembered.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jaime Lannister: I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them?
  <br>Cersei Baratheon: Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.

<p>Tyrion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But that was another one of your lies. It was yours.
  <br><sub>Game of Thrones, S07 E07, ""The Dragon and the Wolf""</sub></p>

<li><p>He has compassion for ""Cripples, Bastards and Broken Things"", specifically Bran in this case, as evidenced when he created the saddle design for him.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tyrion Lannister: Then I'm not a dwarf. My father will rejoice to hear it. I have a gift for you. Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.
  <br>Bran Stark: Will I really be able to ride?
  <br>Tyrion Lannister: You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.
  <br>Robb Stark: Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?

<li><p>He was ""acquitted"" during is Trial by Combat that was won for him by Bronn.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Joffery:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Although quite flimsy he appears to already have been aware of Valyrian steel when he is gifted Widows Wail. It can be argued that he knew about it from Ice but I believe this quote is to replace the similar event that happened in the books.</p>

<li><p>It appears as though Joffery did it in the books so it would make sense to be the same character, though we know the show likes to change things.</p></li>
<li><p>In the books it appears as though he sends the assassin to impress Robert as he says it will be a mercy to kill him than to live a cripple. It appears as though this doesn't happen in the show but the catspaw says something similar so could hint at this too.</p>

  <p>Assassin: You're not supposed to be here. No one is supposed to be here. It's a mercy. He's dead already.
  <br><sub>Game of Thrones, S01 E02, ""The Kingsroad""</sub></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>If Littlefinger did lose the dagger to Robert, as in the books, this could mean that the same person sent the catspaw, though I can't seem to find a quote to back this up.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Littlefinger, Petyr Baelish:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It was his knife at some point so it could have been his directly before the assassination attempt:</p>

  <br>Catelyn Stark: Yours?
  <br>Petyr Baelish: At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger.

<li><p>Chaos is a ladder: He likes to create chaos and then climb the ladder from it.</p></li>
<li><p>The <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Valyrian_steel_dagger"" rel=""noreferrer"">wikia</a> seems to state that as Sansa claims the dagger was his beforehand, see above quote, that he sent the assassin. The only way that they could know this is if Bran told them but as this hasn't been shown on screen we can only speculate if he did or not.</p></li>

<li><a href=""https://moviepilot.com/p/did-bran-send-the-assassin-to-kill-bran-game-of-thrones/4342727"" rel=""noreferrer"">This theory</a> is quite tinfoily but it seems to suggest that because Bran sent the assassin himself when viewing the past to make sure he becomes the Three Eyed Raven.

<p>Does this paragraph from <em>A Storm of Swords</em> confirm that Tywin Lannister reforged Ice into the two Valyrian steel swords meant for Joffrey and Jaime?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","34906","<p>As far as we can tell, <em>Ice</em> was indeed reforged into two Lannister swords: <em>Widow's Wail</em> given to Joffrey, and <em>Oathkeeper</em> given to Jaime. So far in the story (Book 5), we have had no reason to doubt this story. Tywin had very good reasons to do what he did: he forever took away a priceless heirloom from the Starks, and he restored the Lannister status among the great houses who own Valyrian steel weapons, since the ancestral Lannister Valyrian steel sword <em>Brightroar</em> was lost a long time ago when King Tommen II Lannister took it with him to Valyria where he disappeared.</p>

<p>More on the fate of the new Lannister Valyrian swords:</p>

<p>Which dragons was Stannis planning to awaken? Did Dragonstone have a cache of dragon eggs hidden somewhere?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","34969","<p>It is implied that the dragons Melisandre is talking about are part of the architecture of Dragonstone. As described by Salladhor Saan when Davos is pondering about the various dragon-shaped features of Dragonstone:</p>

<p>I do not think Stannis had any dragon eggs, because as Cersei says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If any such eggs remained, Stannis would have sold them to pay for his rebellion,&quot; the queen told him.</p>
<p><sup>A Feast for Crows, Cersei VIII</sup></p>

<p>Which would then imply that it was, in fact, stone dragons that Melisandre thought to wake. She most likely based this on the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Azor_Ahai"" rel=""noreferrer"">Azor Ahai</a> prophecy that says that he shall wake dragons from stone:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It is written in prophecy as well. When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone.&quot;</p>
<p><sup>A Storm of Swords, Davos III -- Melisandre</sup></p>

<p>Since Melisandre is convinced Stannis is Azor Ahai, she assumes that's how the dragons will be awakened. However, we readers have already seen Daenerys being reborn in a fire, hatching her petrified dragon eggs.</p>

<p>Is there anything in either <em>Game of Thrones</em> or <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> that explains why Jeor left his family to join the Night's Watch, and when in his lifetime he did so?</p>

<p>We're not told when and why, but we can make a guess.</p>

<p>&quot;The Watch has no shortage of stableboys,&quot; Lord Mormont grumbled. &quot;That seems to be all they send us these days.

"35038","Has Tywin Lannister ever received a life lesson?","<p>In the <em>Game of Thrones</em> series, Jaime receives a great life lesson: being treated as any other, realizing that he has to do something more for himself, other than being Tywin's son.</p>

<p>Has Tywin ever received something similar? Why is he so strong? I remember reading that Tywin's father almost ruined the family, and he also says this talking with Arya Stark.  Is this all that was necessary to make Tywin the strongest man in the Seven Kingdoms?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><game-of-thrones>","35041","<p>From what little we know about Tywin's youth, he had to shoulder the burden of restoring the glory of House Lannister, after his father Tytos almost ruined it. Outstanding loans were left to stagnate without collection and his bannermen, men who are supposedly loyal to Tytos, openly mocked him in their cups.</p>

<p>Lord Tarbeck was so openly rebellious that not even meek Tytos could turn a blind eye, so he had him imprisoned. Tarbeck's wife retaliated by kidnapping three Lannisters and holding them hostage to insure her husband's safe return. Despite Tywin's protests, Tytos caved in to Lady Tarbeck's demands, further blemishing House Lannister's image. Seeing an opportunity both Houses Tarbeck and Reyne rose in rebellion against their liege lord. By then Tywin had had enough. He personally led the campaign against the rebels. He was so vicious that both houses were completely extinguished and their seats put to the torch. In remembrance, the song ""The Rains of Castamere"" (describing the bloody affair) became something of an unofficial anthem for Tywin.</p>

<p>These events all shaped Tywin into the man he is now: a man who despises weakness of all kinds, values power above all things and has no qualms doing whatever it takes to consolidate it.</p>

"35150","If all the Starks died, would Winterfell rightfully go to the Karstarks?","<p>From <em>A Storm of Swords</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lord Rickard had spoken truly, Catelyn knew. The Karstarks traced their descent to Karlon Stark, a younger son of Winterfell who had put down a rebel lord a thousand years ago, and been granted lands for his valor. The castle he built had been named Karl’s Hold, but that soon became Karhold, and over the centuries the Karhold Starks had become Karstarks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a scenario where all the Starks have died, will Winterfell rightfully go to the Karstarks? Are the Karstarks considered a house of their own or do they still have claim to Winterfell?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","35154","<p>No. As is demonstrated many times in the series, if there is bloodlines to work out, people will tend to do that to find out who the heir is, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>The complex Arryn family tree ends with Harry the Heir</li>
<li>The Frey constantly argue about their lines of succession</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also examples when people just take what they want with physical force or general consensus, such as the dothraki and ironborn, or the wildlings. Or in a rather general way, the way Robert took his throne, and Renly tried to, by combination of both. A convoluted bloodline has also been the Blackfyres' biggest motivation.</p>

<p>I believe that there will always be heirs to be found in major houses. You might have to go back through the generations, but I doubt very much that anyone would ever resort to such generic family ties as those between Stark and Karstark. If no ""direct"" blood relative could be found, whatever the king or ruling house in the north would probably decide who takes over Winterfell.</p>

<p>And anyone who takes Winterfell without the support of the North would probably sit rather insecurely on their lordship.</p>

<p>This is about Tyrion Lannister and his relation with Sansa Stark.</p>

<p>and all we know about her (Tywin Lannister's words) is that </p>

<p>But was the marriage cancelled ? How is that possible ? Tysha surely wasn't a virgin, and nothing is said about her being dead.</p>

<p><strong>So, my question: Did they just divorce? Is that possible? Or maybe Sansa'a marriage with Tyrion is not valid?</strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","35733","<p>As far as I remember Tyrion's marriage was <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tyrion_Lannister"">annulled</a> by his father.</p>

This is not the same as divorce, since it is considered that the couple have never been properly married at all.</p>

<p>So, to directly answer your question: No, they probably did not divorce - the world of Westeros is sufficiently similar to medieval Europe to presume that annulment means the same there. This would make Tyrion's marriage with Sansa completely valid, at least with respect to that particular issue.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Freehold of Valyria is correct. Valyria at the zenith of its power was neither a kingdom nor an empire... or at least it had neither a king nor an emperor. It was more akin to the old Roman Republic, I suppose. In theory, the franchise included all ""free holders,"" that is freeborn landowners. Of course in practice wealthy, highborn, and sorcerously powerful families came to dominate.</p>

<p>The Targaryens were only one of many houses. <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Targaryen#Origins_and_Conquests"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A Wiki of Ice and Fire</a> claims that it was one of forty houses and was not the most powerful one, though this claim is unsourced.</p>

The wildling archers repeatedly hit the straw-men Jon Snow puts up as a distraction. So my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Would it be possible to accurately hit an enemy from the top of the wall, given its height?</p></li>
<li><p>Would it be possible to accurately hit an enemy on top of the wall from the ground, as the wildlings do?</p></li>
</ol>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><game-of-thrones>","36301","<p><strong>Yes. The Great Wall of Westeros is 700 feet or 213 meters tall. On the face of it, it seems within the realm of plausibility to shoot and hit targets at that range.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Looking at formulas for arrows and distance, the most important factor is the amount of force that can be applied to the arrow. Expect to see large bows (long bows, recurve bows) being used in such fight scenes because they are the only bows capable of generating the force required.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Most bow hunters shoot at targets averaging 35 to 75 meters away. Target archers can shoot at ranges of 100 -200 meters. These distances are considering negligible elevation. Shooting at elevate targets reduce range.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Using an advanced technology recurve bow might stretch target shooting to 225 to 250 meters. It takes an extraordinary archer to hit anything further than 200 meters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>So, is it possible to shoot from the top of the Wall of Westeros.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Yes. The archer shooting down has the advantage of gravity working in his favor... The archer on the ground is at a distinct disadvantage but if there are enough of them, that might not matter as much.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Is it possible to hit anything effectively at that distance? A highly-trained, well-equipped archer has a decent chance to hit anything from either position.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Are there examples of long range bow shooting?</strong></p>
<p>The longest arrow flight until recently was 350 meters. Arrows shot this distance are not trying to hit a target. They are trying to cross distances. In the news on Tuesday, August 24, 2010:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zak Crawford, 14, who dreamed of being Robin Hood, shot an arrow nearly 500 metres — equal to the length of five football pitches — using a recurve bow, in the senior under-35lb class, at the Northern Counties Flight Championships - setting the new world record for the Longest bow and arrow shot. He broke the previous world record of 350 metres in senior category by using a recurve bow in the championship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why is this relevant?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>It shows that it is quite possible to launch arrows considerable distances. The limitations are in the strength of the bowman, the pull of the bow, the weight of the arrow, and the elevation of the target.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Elevation reduces range. Accuracy suffers for range but a range of 500 meters (1640 feet) gives credibility to the possibility of such archery being possible if a bit extraordinary.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_longbow#Range_and_penetration"" rel=""noreferrer"">The English Longbow</a> statistics (range and penetration) from Wikipedia:</strong></p>
<blockquote>

<li><p>The range of the medieval weapon is not accurately known, with estimates from 165 to 228 m (180 to 249 yds). Modern longbows have a useful range up to 180 m (200 yd). A 667 N (150 lbf) Mary Rose replica longbow was able to shoot a 53.6 g (1.9 oz) arrow 328 m (360 yd) and a 95.9 g (3.3 oz) a distance of 249.9 m (272 yd).</p>

<li><p>The longbow was capable of long range, and was highly accurate at short range. Most of the longer-range shooting mentioned in stories was not marksmanship, but rather thousands of archers launching volleys of arrows at an army.</p>

<li><p>Longbowmen armies would shoot a rain of arrows landing indiscriminately in the target area. An archer could hit a person at 165 m (180 yards or 540 feet) &quot;part of the time&quot; and could always hit an army.</p>

<p>They have many commonalities.</p>
<p><strong>Royal Birth</strong></p>
<p>Both women were born into royal families.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleopatra the VII was born into the royal family of Philopator, one branch of which ruled Egypt as the Ptolemaic Dynasty.</li>
<li>Daenerys was born into the royal family of Targaryen, which ruled Westeros.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Foreign Origin of Family</strong></p>
<p>Both women's families were not from the nations they ruled.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleopatra's family was foreign to Egypt that came to rule the country after a conquest over 200 years earlier. Her ancestors founded the Ptolemaic dynasty. The Philopators were Greeks of Macedonian origin and ruled Egypt after Alexander the Great conquered Egypt.</li>
<li>Daenerys's family was foreign to Westeros that came to rule the country after a conquest over 200 years earlier. Her ancestors founded the Targaryen dynasty. They were of Valyrian origin.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sibling Marriage in Family</strong></p>
<p>Both women were from families that practiced sibling marriages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Brother-sister marriages were common in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_dynasty"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ptolemaic dynasty</a>. Seven of the 16 Ptolemaic kings married a sister. Another two kings each married two sisters. Cleopatra herself was married to not one, but two, of her brothers when she was a teenager. She later had armies fight against both of her co-ruling brother-husbands and conspired against each of them.</li>
<li>Brother-sister marriages were common in the Targaryen dynasty. Several Targaryen kings married their sisters, and the founder married two.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Death of Brother</strong></p>
<p>Both women were involved in the deaths of their brothers.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is believed that Cleopatra had <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_XIV_of_Egypt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">one of her brother-husbands</a> killed by poison for the benefit of her son, Caesarion.</li>
<li>Daenerys's brother, Viserys, was killed by her lover, Khal Drogo.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cruel Fathers</strong></p>
<p>Both women's fathers were known for cruelty towards their subjects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ancient Egyptians hated Cleopatra's father, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_XII_Auletes"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ptolemy XII</a>, for the cruelty he inflicted on them.</li>
<li>Daenerys's father, Aerys II, had people burnt alive.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Polyglot</strong></p>
<p>Both women spoke several languages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleopatra spoke nine languages fluently and rarely used an interpreter.</li>
<li>Daenerys speaks multiple languages (not sure how many), but used an interpreter to hide the fact that she understood what foreign rulers said about her.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exile</strong></p>
<p>Both women lived in exile.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleopatra was forced into exile as a teenager after military losses during the war against one of her brother-husbands.</li>
<li>Daenerys grew up in exile due to military losses against her father and brother before she was born.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conquest</strong></p>
<p>Both women returned from exile to conquer the kingdoms they were born to rule.</p>
<ul>
<li>At age 21, Cleopatra raised an army in exile and worked with foreign leaders to reconquer Egypt.</li>
<li>In her late teens or early 20's, Daenerys raised an army in exile and worked with foreign leaders in her attempt to reconquer Westeros.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In Battle</strong></p>
<p>Both women were present at important battles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleopatra was present at the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Actium"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Battle of Actium</a>, a decisive event that gave Rome supremacy over Egypt.</li>
<li>Daenerys participated in several battles using her dragons.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sexual Appeal</strong></p>
<p>Both women used their bodies to allure men to do their bidding.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleopatra had herself smuggled into Julius Caesar's palace and then seduced him. She also seduced Marc Antony and several other powerful men.</li>
<li>Daenerys seduced several powerful men to further her political ambitions.</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems that the major differences between them are that one had dragons and the other did not, that one fought ice zombies and the other did not, and that one used blood magic, and the other did not.</p>
<p><strong>Did George R. R. Martin have Cleopatra in mind when he wrote chapters about Daenerys?</strong></p>
<p>I am looking for answers based on comments, writings, or interviews of the author.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><inspiration>","172281","<h1>Real Answer</h1>

<p>The answer is <strong>We do not know</strong>.</p>

<p>As far as I know, George has never talked about his inspiration behind Daenerys Targaryen, which of course we must note, there need not be any.</p>

<p>GRRM has however talked about what inspires him.</p>

<p>He has <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/950"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mentioned that</a> war of the Roses is one of the key influences on him:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The Wars of the Roses have always fascinated me, and certainly did influence A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE</strong>, but there's really no one-for-one
  character-for-character correspondence. I like to use history to
  flavor my fantasy, to add texture and versimillitude, but simply
  rewriting history with the names changed has no appeal for me. I
  prefer to reimagine it all, and take it in new and unexpected
  directions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And he also stated that It's the <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Historical_Influences/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">English and French history which are the core of his historical borrowings</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q: [Edited for clarity after this point. Ser Loras's (Ser Loras is the
  nickname of the fan) question concerning whether GRRM borrows from
  history, particularly Spanish history, received the reply below.]</p>
  
  <p>George: Well, yes and no. I have drawn on a great many influences for
  these books. I do use incidents from history, yes, although I try not
  to do a straight one-for-one transposition of fact into fiction. I
  prefer to mix and match, and to add in some imaginative elements as
  well.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Most of my borrowings, however, come from English and French medieval history, simply because I am more familiar with those than
  with the heroes, legends, and traditions of other countries.</strong> The
  Wars of the Roses, the Crusades, and the Hundred Years War have been
  my biggest influences... oh, and some Scottish history as well, such
  as the infamous Black Dinner that inspired my own Red Wedding. This
  isn't a matter of choice so much as it is one of necessity. <strong>I don't
  have any other language besides English, and there's a paucity of good
  popular English language histories about medieval Spain, medieval
  Germany, and the like</strong>. I was in Germany last fall, and looked
  everywhere for good reference books about the medieval Holy Roman
  Empire, which would be treasure trove, I suspect. There are a ton of
  them that looked likely... but all in German.</p>
  
  <p>And in about a week I will be travelling to Spain, coincidentally
  enough, where I plan to search for some good popular histories as
  well. Whether I will find any I can read, however... well, it's
  doubtful. </p>

<h1>Other similar historical characters</h1>

<p>There are however a number of similar historical characters other than  Cleopatra  who share something with Daenerys Targaryen.</p>

<h3><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VII_of_England"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Henry VII of England</a></h3>

<p>There are many who draw parallels between Henry VII Tudor and Daenerys I Targaryen. The core reasons are following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Both of them lived in Exile across the narrow sea (Or English channel).</li>
<li>Both lost their fathers in early age, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Tudor,_1st_Earl_of_Richmond"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Edmund</a> and Aerys.</li>
<li>Both of them are pitted against a usurper,  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_IV"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Edward IV</a> in Henry's case and Robert in Daenerys'.</li>
<li>Another usurper appears who removes the heirs of original usurper Edward IV/Robert Baratheon. That's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_III"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Richard III</a> and Joffrey Baratheon. </li>
<li>Both are the rightful heirs in eyes of some nobles. </li>
<li>Both used dragons on their banners.</li>
<li>Both had dissidents join them in exile.</li>
<li>Daenerys had Ser Barristan, Henry had <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_de_Vere,_13th_Earl_of_Oxford"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">John de Vere</a>, Earl of Oxford.</li>
<li>This fits with the author's area of historical expertise. GRRM has already stated that his core inspirations come from French and English history, particularly the war of Roses. </li>
</ol>

<h3><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abd_al-Rahman_I"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Abd el Rahman I ""The Falcon"" of Andalusia</a></h3>

<p>Personally, I see more of Abd el Rahman I Umayyad of Andalusia in her than Henry VII. </p>

<p>Here's why:</p>

<ol>
<li>Both were last scions of great dynasties, him the last of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Umayya"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Umayyads</a> (At least he thought so at the time but later other members turned up like Aemon tried to reach Daenerys), her the last of the Targaryens. <br><br>🎶 <em>Oh I am the last of the Umayyads/Targaryens, my people are gone from the world. The last of the great Syrian/Westerosi Umayyads/Targaryens, who ruled half the world/Westeros at my birth.....They hunt me with dogs in the day light, they hunt me with torches by night. For these Abbasids/Baratheons who are small can never stand tall, whilst Umayyads/Targaryens still walk in the light.</em>🎶 <br><br></li>
<li>Both had their families ousted in popular rebellions.</li>
<li>Both lost their fathers early, He lost <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu%27awiya_ibn_Hisham"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Muawiyah</a>, she lost Aerys.</li>
<li>Both ran from their home with their brothers while their families were butchered.</li>
<li>Brothers of both Abd al-Rehman and Daenerys were killed.</li>
<li>Both ran for their lives, in fear.</li>
<li>Both then managed to carve themselves a Kingdom with no other strength than their own.</li>
<li>Both never forgot where they came from and always wanted to go back.
To go East (Damascus), Abd al-Rehman had to go West (Andalus). Daenerys was told by Quaithe that to go West (Westeros) she had to go east. He wanted to go East and fate kept taking him further and further West. She wants to go West but fate keeps taking her further and further East.</li>
<li>Both then decided to improve the affairs of their newly forged Kingdoms. So both of them stayed and ruled. Abd al-Rehman planted Date Palm trees, Daenerys planted olive trees.</li>
<li>Both were polyglots. </li>
</ol>

<p>On an unrelated note, regarding the Black Dinner being the inspiration for the Red Wedding, there's sort of a Black Dinner from this character's life too. After their rival family, Abbasids deposed the Umayyads, the new Caliph <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As-Saffah"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Abu al-Abbas</a> invited the members of the deposed dynasty who were still in the capital to a dinner. When the guests arrived, Abbasids had them all beaten to death with clubs before the first course. The table was set then on their corpses and Abu al-Abbas, henceforth known as As-Saffah (Blood-shedder) had dinner with his friends and Generals. </p>

<p>Abd el Rahman however never managed to return to take back his Grandfather's throne. He never managed to avenge his family. In the end he built a new Palace, named  and modeled after the Imperial Palace he was born in, al-Rusafa , and planted Palm Trees there so that he could give himself some solace that he was still home. </p>

<p>Here's a testimonial by one of his greatest enemies, the Caliph al-Mansur of Abbasid Empire, which should really summarise all the similarities between him and Daenerys.The Caliph asked his courtiers that who deserved the title of ""Falcon of Quraysh"" (Most capable man of the tribe of Quraysh). Courtiers replied that it would have to be the Caliph himself. He said no. Courtiers said then it would have to be Muawiya I (Founder of Umayyad Caliphate), the Caliph again said no. The courtiers then presented the name of Abd al-Malk (One of the greatest Umayyad Caliphs), the Caliph again said no. Courtiers asked then who might deserve the title? The Caliph replied:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The falcon of Quraysh is Abd al-Rahman, who escaped by his cunning the
  spearheads of the lances and the blades of the swords, who after
  wandering solitary through the deserts of Asia and Africa, had the
  boldness to seek his fortune without an army, in lands unknown to him
  beyond the sea. Having naught to rely upon save his own wits and
  perseverance, he nonetheless humiliated his proud foes, exterminated
  rebels, organized cities, mobilized armies, secured his frontiers
  against the Christians, founded a great empire and reunited under his
  scepter a realm that seemed already parcelled out among others. No man
  before him ever did such deeds. Mu'awiya rose to his stature through
  the support of Umar and Uthman, whose backing allowed him to overcome
  difficulties; Abd al-Malik, because of previous appointment; and the
  Commander of the Faithful [i.e. al-Mansur himself] through the
  struggle of his kin and the solidarity of his partisans. But Abd
  al-Rahman did it alone, with the support of none other than his own
  judgment, depending on no one but his own resolve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He also wrote a beautiful poem for his trees. Translated version below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the midst of Rusafa</p>
  
  <p>Grows a palm-tree;</p>
  
  <p>Born in the West,</p>
  
  <p>Away from the country of palm-trees.   I cried: You are like me,</p>
  
  <p>For you resemble me</p>
  
  <p>In wandering and peregrination,</p>
  
  <p>And the long separation from kith and kin.   You also</p>
  
  <p>Grew up on a foreign soil;</p>
  
  <p>Like me,</p>
  
  <p>You are far from the country of your birth.   May the fertilizing
  clouds of morning</p>
  
  <p>Water you in exile,</p>
  
  <p>May the beneficent rains besought by the poor</p>
  
  <p>Never forsake you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And so ended the reign of Abd el-Rahman I of House Umayyad, called ""The Immigrant"" by his subjects and ""the Falcon"" by his foes. He built a realm that would be called ""Jewel of the World"", defeated his foes, provided a new home for his Kin where they would rule for centuries to come, crushed rebellions, united the Iberian peninsula, threw back invasions from North and South but he never got his heart's one true desire, Home!</p>

<h3><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boran"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pourandokht I of Persia</a></h3>

<p>The first woman to rule the Sassanian Empire had somethings in common with Daenerys as well, although not as much as the first two candidates:</p>

<ol>
<li>She lost her father and most of her family when a coup in favor of her brother Kavadh II ended in wholesale murder of the Imperial Family with the King and thirty of his sons being executed by the new King. </li>
<li>Kavadh died soon and Usurper <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahrbaraz"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Shahrbaraz</a> a Persian General then killed his minor son <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardashir_III"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ardeshir III</a> and claimed the throne for himself.</li>
<li>While it is unknown who was her mother, It is very possible that she was a product of incest as <a href=""http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/marriage-next-of-kin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">practice of Incest was considered holy by Zoroastrianism</a>. But if her mother was related to her father, then she'd be a proper wife, not a concubine and she would not have been unknown, as then she'd be a Persian Princess, not some random lowborn girl.</li>
</ol>

<p>Within forty days of the usurper's actions, the loyalists murdered him and crowned Princess Pourandokht as First Sassanian female Empress. She was then deposed in favor of her sister Azarmidokht, who was then murdered by another General. So Pourandokht was crowned for a second time. And then she was murdered herself.</p>

<h3><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yazdegerd_III"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Yazdegerd III of Persia</a></h3>

<p>Yezdegerd also bears some resemblence with Daenerys:</p>

<ol>
<li>Both were last scions of great Dynasties. Yezdegerd was practically the last Sassanian when he was crowned. </li>
<li>Both lost their fathers early. His father Prince Shahryar was executed by his uncle Kavadh II. </li>
<li>In the following civil war which saw the Persian throne usurped by a General and the coronations of his aunts Pourandokht and Azarmidokht, he was hiding in Estakhr for his life. </li>
<li>The rival factions however decided to make him Emperor as a compromise when he was somewhere between 12-16, when someone murdered his aunt Empress Pourandokht. A year after he was crowned, Arabs invaded and ended the Persian Empire for good. Yezdegerd fled into exile with his children. </li>

Martin: Why he wrote The Red Wedding -- EXCLUSIVE</a> GRRM is quoted as saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve said in many interviews that I like my fiction to be
  unpredictable. I like there to be considerable suspense. I killed Ned
  in the first book and it shocked a lot of people. I killed Ned because
  everybody thinks he’s the hero and that, sure, he’s going to get into
  trouble, but then he’ll somehow get out of it. The next predictable
  thing is to think his eldest son is going to rise up and avenge his
  father. And everybody is going to expect that. So immediately [killing
  Robb] became the next thing I had to do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, in ASOIAF the death of key characters (on all 'sides') makes the work unpredictable to a reader lulled into a certain sense of security about the life and death of key characters in many other works (especially those that center on a single protagonist- e.g. Harry Potter). [I'm refraining from giving concrete examples to avoid spoilers.]</p>

<p>Is it possible that <em>Valar Morghulis</em> (all men must die) is a sort of meta-theme of ASOIAF and the nature of the world that GRRM has created as an author? </p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","36538","<p>(Spoilering things that haven't happened on TV yet, even though this is about the books.)</p>

<p>I think <em>valar morghulis</em> is actually a bit <em>too</em> morbid to be considered an overarching theme of Martin's world. It's more accurate to say that Martin's world is based on the idea that ""<em>any</em> man <em>could</em> die"".</p>

<p>I may regret saying this the minute the next book comes out, but I don't think that <em>every</em> character in the story is going to end up dying before the story ends. Some will need to survive to bring the story to its climax and resolution.</p>

<p>What Martin is trying to do, instead, is to intentionally subvert many of the standard tropes of medieval fantasy. Martin is removing the built-in invulnerability that often comes with certain character types, and clearly indicating that he is willing and able to kill off characters when it advanced his story. But he's also willing to let characters <em>survive</em> when it fits his story; for example: Tyrion, Beric Dondarrion, Sandor Clegane, and</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Catelyn Stark</p>
</blockquote>

<p>among others. These are people that were in situations where we expected them to and/or actually watched them die, yet Martin kept them alive/resurrected them because it made the story better.</p>

<p>People often express this as Martin striving for realism, or cynicism. I think both of those are true but missing the point. Martin's world is apathetic and brutal. The ""world"", such as it were, didn't care that Ned Stark was a really good guy. He made stupid decisions and he died. Same goes for Robb -- the fact that he betrayed the Freys ""for love"" did not make a difference in the end. But the same goes for the cynical or despicable characters that also met a bad end, e.g.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Joffrey and Tywin</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those characters didn't die because they were good or evil, they died because of a combination of specific actions they took, actions beyond their own control, and a bit of bad luck. That's how the natural world actually works, and Martin seems to be trying to remind us over and over that no one is immune to the whims of nature. But that doesn't mean nature ""has it out"" for anyone, it just has no particular preference for which characters end up suffering/dying and which don't.</p>

<h2>Longclaw</h2>
<p>Though not exactly the same when you look at the replicas the sword keeps the main spirit alive so I'd say it is faithful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pommel was a hunk of pale stone weighted with lead to balance the long blade. It had been carved into the likeness of a snarling wolf's head, with chips of garnet set into the eyes. The grip was virgin leather, soft and black, as yet unstained by sweat or blood. The blade itself was a good half foot longer than those Jon was used to, tapered to thrust as well as slash, with three fullers deeply incised in the metal. Where Ice was a true two-handed greatsword, this was a hand-and-a-halfer, sometimes named a &quot;bastard sword.&quot; Yet the wolf sword actually seemed lighter than the blades he had wielded before. When Jon turned it sideways, he could see the ripples in the dark steel where the metal had been folded back on itself again and again. &quot;This is Valyrian steel, my lord,&quot; he said wonderingly. His father had let him handle Ice often enough; he knew the look, the feel.</p>

<p>Like Longclaw this isn't an exact copy but it does seem similar enough that they can be considered to be faithful to the books.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Because you are so beautiful.&quot; His hands were large and strong, and there was something in his hard blue eyes and great curving nose that suggested the fierceness of some splendid bird of prey. &quot;Prendahl talked too much and said too little.&quot; His garb, rich as it was, had seen hard wear; salt stains patterned his boots, the enamel of his nails was chipped, his lace was soiled by sweat, and she could see where the end of his cloak was fraying. &quot;And Sallor picked his nose as if his snot was gold.&quot; He stood with his hands crossed at the wrists, his palms resting on the pommels of his blades; a curving Dothraki arakh on his left hip, a Myrish stiletto on his right. Their hilts were a matched pair of golden women, naked and wanton.</p>

<h2>Shagga Son of Dolf's Battle Axes</h2>
<p>This one is actually quite straight forward, both quotes from the books and show appear to come to the same conclusion on Shagga's weapons.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Lefford frowned. &quot;I saw that great hairy one today, the one who insisted that he must have <strong>two battle-axes, the heavy black steel ones with twin crescent blades.</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>The show also uses a similar quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kevan Lannister: &quot;The great hairy one insisted he must have <strong>two battle-axes, heavy black steel, double-sided.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>Tyrion Lannister: &quot;<strong>Shagga</strong> likes axes.&quot;</p>

<h1>Swords that aren't faithful</h1>
<p>For completeness sake I am also going to cover some of the main swords in the series. These are ones that are named and shown or belong to a main character (also mostly ones that Valyrian Steel have also created replicas for).</p>
<p>As a general comment I just want to repeat that Valyrian Steel is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your source of officially licensed replica weapons and armor from HBO® 's hit TV series Game of Thrones® , and George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire book series.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As such their depictions of the weapons should be pretty accurate, especially since apparently they work with GRRM to design them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We manufacture weapon and armor replicas from George R.R. Martin's bestselling book series. Each item is an individually serialized limited edition and comes with a certificate of authenticity personally autographed by Mr. Martin himself. <strong>Each item is designed while working closely with Mr. Martin to make sure they fit his vision.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also that their A Song of Ice and Fire swords come with the following notices, the following is for needle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the exclusive officially licensed Needle, Sword of Arya Stark, from &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire.&quot; All swords come with a <strong>certificate of authenticity personally autographed by George R.R. Martin.</strong> Each sword is a limited edition of 2500 pieces and the back of the blade has been laser etched in very fine print with the edition number and a copyright notice so you know it is authentic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As such it appears that GRRM agrees that these are the versions of the swords that are true to the books.</p>
<p>Each of the following blades are different in the show compared to the books:</p>
<h3>Ice</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Eddard Stark dismounted and his ward Theon Greyjoy brought forth the sword. &quot;Ice,&quot; that sword was called. It was as wide across as a man's hand, and taller even than Robb. The blade was Valyrian steel, spell-forged and dark as smoke. Nothing held an edge like Valyrian steel.</p>
<p><sub>A Game of Thrones, Bran I</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CfIwBm.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CfIwBm.jpg"" alt=""Ned with Ice"" /></a> <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/afxVPm.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/afxVPm.jpg"" alt=""Ice - book version"" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see from the above pictures the hilt is completely different. The book version has a white grip with gold and silver decoration in the middle, it also appears to be made of suede. The crossguard is quite short to the sword width of has the words &quot;Winter is Coming&quot; written across it, lastly, it has a folded, patterned blade characteristic of Valyrian Steel. In the show however, the hilt has a large plain crossguard and a large brown grip. This grip also appears to be made of leather.</p>
<h3>Widows Wail</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>His father glanced up. &quot;I did. Come have a look at this.&quot; A bundle of oilcloth lay on the table between them, and Lord Tywin had a longsword in his hand. &quot;A wedding gift for Joffrey,&quot; he told Tyrion. The light streaming through the diamond-shaped panes of glass made the blade shimmer black and red as Lord Tywin turned it to inspect the edge, while the pommel and crossguard flamed gold. &quot;With this fool's jabber of Stannis and his magic sword, it seemed to me that we had best give Joffrey something extraordinary as well. A king should bear a kingly weapon.&quot;</p>
<p><sub>A Storm of Swords, Tyrion IV</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/asrOUm.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/asrOUm.jpg"" alt=""Joffery with Widows Wail"" /></a></p>
<p>There isn't a replica for the book version of Widows Wail yet but we can expect it to be different as the blade is meant to be red and the show blade is not.</p>
<h3>Oathkeeper</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A crimson sword might flash prettily in the sun, but if truth be told I like these colors better,&quot; said Tyrion. &quot;They have an ominous beauty . . . and they make this blade unique. There is no other sword like it in all the world, I should think.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is one.&quot; The armorer bent over the table and unfolded the bundle of oilcloth, to reveal a second longsword.</p>
<p>Tyrion put down Joffrey's sword and took up the other. If not twins, the two were at least close cousins. This one was thicker and heavier, a half-inch wider and three inches longer, but they shared the same fine clean lines and the same distinctive color, the ripples of blood and night. Three fullers, deeply incised, ran down the second blade from hilt to point; the king's sword had only two. Joff's hilt was a good deal more ornate, the arms of its crossguard done as lions' paws with ruby claws unsheathed, but both swords had grips of finely tooled red leather and gold lions' heads for pommels.</p>
<p><sub>A Storm of Swords, Tyrion IV</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3HpWjm.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3HpWjm.jpg"" alt=""Brienne with Oathkeeper"" /></a> <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pdL0Xm.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pdL0Xm.jpg"" alt=""Oathkeeper - book version"" /></a></p>
<p>Again like Widows Wail it isn't faithful as it doesn't have the characteristic red blade from the books. Looking at the hilts, they too are completely different. In the show it is one piece of a golden lion and quite decorative. Whereas, in the books it has a simple gold crossguard with a lion on each end, a red grip and gold detailed pommel.</p>
<h3>Valrian Steel Dagger</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The blade Joff chose was nice and plain. No goldwork, no jewels in the hilt, no silver inlay on the blade. King Robert never wore it, had likely forgotten he owned it. Yet the Valyrian steel was deadly sharp . . . sharp enough to slice through skin, flesh, and muscle in one quick stroke. I am no stranger to Valyrian steel. But he had been, hadn't he? Else he would never have been so foolish as to pick Littlefinger's knife.</p>

<p>There is no replica of the book version yet, however, I have found this quote from GRRM claiming that they are different:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A handsome blade, I think. Though rather completely different from the dagger in the books, which was far plainer (though made of Valryian steel, with a dragonbone grip).</p>

</blockquote>
<h3>Dawn - The Sword of Morning's Sword</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, had a sad smile on his lips. The hilt of the greatsword Dawn poked up over his right shoulder.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&quot;And now it begins,&quot; said Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. He unsheathed Dawn and held it with both hands. The blade was pale as milkglass, alive with light.</p>
<p><sub>A Game of Thrones, Eddard X</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although there isn't a replica of the book version, in the show Ser Arthur Dayne dual wields two swords so it's possible they changed the sword into two. However, When Ned rides upto the Kingsguard Arthur has a sword out in front of him. This looks to be Dawn.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y6bXSm.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y6bXSm.jpg"" alt=""Ser Arthur Dayne with Dawn"" /></a></p>
<p>If it is then the shows version doesn't look to be faithful to the books as it doesn't look to be a greatsword and does not have a pale milkglass blade.</p>
<h3>Jaime Lannister's Sword</h3>
<p>Although there is a lack of information in the books about his sword it appears as though it isn't faithful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jaime Lannister poked at Ned's chest with the <strong>gilded sword</strong> that had sipped the blood of the last of the Dragonkings. &quot;Would she? The noble Catelyn Tully of Riverrun murder a hostage? I think … not.&quot; He sighed. &quot;But I am not willing to chance my brother's life on a woman's honor.&quot; Jaime slid the <strong>golden sword</strong> into its sheath.</p>
<p><sub>A Game of Thrones, Eddard IX</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It isn't totally clear and open to interpretation but knowing that Oathkeeper and Widows Wail are both red I'd assume that it means for the blade to have been golden. Also it is mentioned as being golden on numerous occasions leading more credit to it actually having a golden blade.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The polished skulls of the last dragons staring down sightlessly from the walls of the throne room while the Kingslayer opened Father's throat with a <strong>golden sword</strong>.</p>
<p><sub>A Game of Thrones, Daenerys I</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As such the show version doesn't seem to match this description.</p>

<hr />
<h1>Swords where it's unclear</h1>
<p>The following swords are unclear as to whether or not they are faithful.</p>
<h3>Khal Drogo's Arakh</h3>
<p>There isn't much description on Drogo's weapons, the only bit I could find was his &quot;brides gifts&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Haggo gave her a great leather whip with a silver handle, Cohollo a <strong>magnificent arakh chased in gold</strong>, and Qotho a double-curved dragonbone bow taller than she was.</p>
<p><sub>A Game of Thrones, Daenerys II</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As it's unclear whether or not this was the Khal's arakh of choice I can't say for sure whether the show was faithful. However, the show replica is not to that description.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0pSJLm.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0pSJLm.jpg"" alt=""Khal Drogo's Arakh"" /></a></p>
<h3>Heartsbane</h3>
<p>There is little to no description of the sword in the books other than it's a Valyrian steel greatsword.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Drumm nodded, one hand on the hilt of his Red Rain. &quot;Lord Tarly bears the greatsword Heartsbane, forged of Valyrian steel, and he is always in Lord Tyrell's van.&quot;</p>
<p><sub>A Feast for Crows, The Reaver</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As such it's unclear whether of not the shows version is faithful to the books.</p>

<h3>King Robert Baratheon's War Hammer</h3>
<p>This is the odd one of the bunch in that it isn't technically a sword but I think it still fits within the scope of the question. It's also the only one where it is clear from the books perspective of what it should look like but not the show. The following image is of the books replica:</p>

<p>Was this ever explicitly mentioned in the books? I only recall Theon losing a few fingers and teeth in addition to having parts of his skin flayed.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><adaptation-comparison>","36826","<p>It's implied, but not confirmed that he lost that part.

"36871","How does raven post work?","<p>How does raven post work? A raven knows to fly to one particular castle. But what happens after that? Kept at its home castle, a raven is useless.</p>

<p>The only solution I can think of is that ravens are redistributed by ground, carted in cages (or shipped by sea). That'd work, although slowly—Westeros takes weeks to traverse. This'd explain why raven post is so costly.</p>

<p>Is this ever discussed in the books? Of all the characters travelling between castles, I don't recall any moving ravens, or seeing others doing it.</p>

<hr>

<p>The system above is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attack. Suppose a man arrived at Winterfell with a trout on his coat and a cage of ravens ""from Riverrun"". It's entirely possible that the man and the ravens came from <em>Casterly Rock</em>, and that letters sent with them find their way to Tywin Lannister.</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><game-of-thrones>","36872","<p>According to a <a href=""http://www.ign.com/boards/threads/sample-chapter-from-winds-of-winter.207815997/"">sample chapter</a> from the Winds of Winter, most ravens can only fly to one place, although there are rare exceptions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""A maester's raven flies to one place, and one place only. Is that correct?""</p>
  
  <p>The maester mopped sweat from his brow with his sleeve. ""N-not entirely, Your Grace. Most, yes. Some few can be taught to fly between two castles. Such birds are greatly prized. And once in a very great while, we find a raven who can learn the names of three or four or five castles, and fly to each upon command. Birds as clever as that come along only once in a hundred years.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other than those rare birds, presumably once a raven is back at its home castle it would then have to be transported to a new location in a cage in order for it to be of any practical use. The clearest example of this is, as Zoe mentioned, when the Night's Watch took a cart of ravens with them on the Great Ranging. There may be other examples as well.</p>

<hr />

<p>Regarding a ""man-in-the-middle"" attack. To prevent such an attack you would either have to cipher your messages using a code only the intended recipient knows how to decode, or you would have to know/trust the person(s) bringing you the ravens. </p>

<p>Neither contingency is discussed in the books, although in <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Game_of_Thrones-Chapter_6"">chapter 6 of GOT</a> Catelyn  mentions that a letter sent by Lysa was written using a secret language only the two of them shared. And it is not unreasonable that the people bringing/receiving ravens would expect to know each other.</p>

<p>In ""our"" universe (IE outside of the books), <a href=""http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1149.txt"">RFC 1149</a> briefly discusses security considerations for secure transmission of data via avian carriers:</p>

<p>The usually very accurate and well sourced wiki by Elio M. Garcia and Linda Antonsson (who started <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/About/"" rel=""noreferrer"">westeros.org</a>) states that although Maester Cressen left his seat at Storm's End and joined Stannis a Dragonstone, it was very uncommon for Maesters to do because of their role at one House.</p>

<p>Cressen likely accepted to follow Stannis because Stannis was like a son to him. After the death of their Father Steffon Baratheon, it was left to Maester Cressen to raise the three boys, of which Cressen love Stannis the most.</p>

<p>Once he had dreamed of being a maester in a castle, in service to some open-handed lord who would honor him for his wisdom and bestow a fine white horse on him to thank him for his service.<br />
<sub>A Feast for Crows - Prologue</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>One contradiction to this is Roose Bolton taking three Maesters from the seat they serve and having them serve at Winterfell after he kills Maester Luwin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before the war, Medrick had served Lord Hornwood, Rhodry Lord Cerwyn, and young Henly Lord Slate. <strong>Roose Bolton had brought them all to Winterfell to take charge of Luwin's ravens</strong>, so messages might be sent and received from here again.<br />

</blockquote>
<p>Maester Colemon also followed his Lord, Jon Arryn, to King's Landing abandoning (albeit temporarily) the seat he was assigned. He was sent back after he was succesfully purging Jon Arryn of his poison because the &quot;queen needed him dead&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I have heard that you sent Maester Colemon away.&quot;
The Grand Maester's nod was as slow and deliberate as a glacier. &quot;I did, and I fear the Lady Lysa will never forgive me that. Maybe I was wrong, but at the time I thought it best. Maester Colemon is like a son to me, and I yield to none in my esteem for his abilities, but he is young, and the young ofttimes do not comprehend the frailty of an older body. He was purging Lord Arryn with wasting potions and pepper juice, and I feared he might kill him.&quot;<br />

</blockquote>
<p>His departure is later confirmed by Ned,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A pity Lysa carried them off to the Vale,&quot; Ned said dryly. &quot;The gods are doing their best to vex us. Lady Lysa, Maester Colemon, Lord Stannis … everyone who might actually know the truth of what happened to Jon Arryn is a thousand leagues away.&quot;<br />

</blockquote>
<p>and Catelyn meets him in the Eyrie, showing that he indeed returned there with Lysa:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The sun was well above the mountains by the time Catelyn Stark finally reached the Eyrie. A stocky, silver-haired man in a sky-blue cloak and hammered moon-and-falcon breastplate helped her from the basket; Ser Vardis Egen, captain of Jon Arryn's household guard. Beside him stood Maester Colemon, thin and nervous, with too little hair and too much neck.&quot;</p>

"37074","Where to pick up reading ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" after the third season?","<p>So I just finished the third season of <em>Game of Thrones</em>, and I probably don't have the patience to wait for the 4th and 5th and 6th (insert mathematical notation for sum of series) seasons to tell me what happens next.</p>

  <p> <strong>Q. Where do I start reading?</strong><br>
<br>
 A. There is no clear cut place you can start, but Book 3 ""A Storm of<br>
 Swords"" Chapter 39 ""Tyrion"" (page number varies by edition) is as good<br>
 as any. There will be some overlap with the TV series, but that's<br>
 unavoidable.<br>
<br>
<br>
 ----------<br>
<br>
<br>
 <strong>Q. What character changes do I need to know to start reading?</strong><br>
<br>
 A. Here's a quick guide:<br>
<br>
 <strong>Ros</strong>: Does not exist in the books and is an amalgamation of several prostitute characters, chiefly Alayaya.<br>
<br>
 <strong>Yara Greyjoy</strong>: Is called Asha Greyjoy in the books.<br>
<br>
 <strong>Aeron Greyjoy</strong>: Book only character. Theon's uncle. A once playboy, he later discovers religion and becomes the head priest of the Drowned
 God faith. He is called Damphair by his followers.<br>
<br>
 <strong>Ser Barristan the Bold</strong>: Is disguised as an old squire called Arstan who squires for Strong Belwas. He has not yet revealed his
 identity to Dany.<br>
<br>
 <strong>Strong Belwas</strong>: Book only character. A eunuch gladiatorial warrior who joins Dany along with Ser Barristan.<br>
<br>
 <strong>Loras Tyrell</strong>: Is <em>not</em> the only Tyrell son. He is the youngest son after Wylas Tyrell (a lame legged scholar) and Garlan Tyrell (a
 skilled knight who is better at swordsplay than Loras).<br>
<br>
 <strong>Pyp</strong>: TV Pyp is a combination of book Pyp (mischievous prankster ranger) and Dareon (singer who was sent to the Wall because he refused
 the sexual advances of a lord).<br>
<br>
 <strong>Thoros of Myr</strong>: TV Thoros is a combination of book Thoros (a priest of the Red God who lost his way and has now regained his faith) and
 Tom o'Sevens (a fun loving bard).<br>
<br>
 <strong>Talisa</strong>: There is no Talisa in the books. Her counterpart is Jeyne Westerling. See below for more on her story.<br>
<br>
 <strong>Shae</strong>: Book Shae is not nearly as well explored. In the books Shae comes off as mischievous (without the mean streak of TV Shae),
 spoiled, and an obvious gold digger. She never called herself Shae the
 Funny Whore.<br>
<br>
 <strong>Dagmar Cleftjaw</strong>: While he was still an underling of Theon, he never joined him in Winterfell. The role taken by TV Cleftjaw in
 Winterfell was done by Reek in the books.<br>
<br>
 <strong>Donal Noye</strong>: The Night's Watch smith and a mentor of sorts to Jon Snow.<br>
<br>
 <strong>Kevan Lannister</strong>: Tywin's brother and right hand man, has a more prominent role in the books.<br>
<br>
 <strong>Edric Storm</strong>: A young boy who is King Robert's most well known bastard son since his mother is a noble lady.<br>
<br>
 <strong>Vargo Hoat</strong>: Leader of the mercenary company The Brave Companions who currently operate in the Riverlands. He hath a very pronounthed
 lithp.<br>
<br>
 <strong>Ser Dontos Hollard</strong>: Appears briefly in the TV show, but has a much more expanded role in the books. After he is demoted to jester, he starts secretly helping Sansa after she saved his life. He is currently planning Sansa's escape.<br>
<br>
 <strong>Qyburn</strong>: He is still a disgraced former Maester, but in the books he is part of The Brave Companions mercenary group.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
 <strong>Q. What story changes do I need to know to start reading?</strong><br>
<br>
<br>
 Here's a quick breakdown by story line:<br>
<br>
 <strong>The Starks at Winterfell:</strong><br>
<br>
 * The Stark children are much younger. At the beginning of the story Robb and Jon are 14, Sansa is 11, Arya is 9, Bran is 6, Rickon is 3.
 However GRRM has expressed that if he had to do it all over again he
 would age up the children.<br>
<br>
 * There are plenty of rumors going around about the identity of Jon's mother. Chief among them is that the mother is Lady Ashara Dayne,
 sister of Ser Arthur Dayne a knight of the Kingsguard that Ned
 defeated in combat with the help of his friend Howland Reed during the
 rebellion. Ashara committed suicide soon after.<br>
<br>
 <strong>The Starks in King's Landing:</strong><br>
<br>
 * A recurring flashback that Ned has is the famous Tower of Joy scene. Back during the final days of the rebellion, Ned Stark and six
 companions arrive at the Tower of Joy where Lyanna Stark is being
 held. They are met by three Kingsguard knights. Details after that are
 blurry. We know that all three Kingsguard were killed, but not before
 grievously wounding Ned and killing all his companions except for
 Howland Reed. Lyanna dies as well in a ""bed of red"" extracting a
 mysterious ""promise"" from Ned before dying.<br>
<br>
 <strong>The War with Robb Stark:</strong><br>
<br>
 * Tyrion didn't sleep through the Battle of the Greenfork, and he played an active combat role.<br>
<br>
 * Tywin never takes command of Harrenhall, and thus he never met Arya. Harrenhall is commanded by Gregor Clegane, then afterwards by his
 underling Ser Amory Lorch who is aided by the mercenary company The
 Brave Companions.<br>
<br>
 * Arya uses her final kill to free the Stark affiliated prisoners. That action along with The Brave Companions betraying the Lannisters,
 and the timely arrival of Roose Bolton changes the ownership of the
 castle to Roose Bolton. Jaqen then leaves. Arya continues to hide
 her identity and serves as Bolton's page. When Bolton decides to leave
 and join the war effort, he leaves The Brave Companions in charge, and
 abandons Arya. It is then that Arya stages her escape with Gendry and
 Hotpie, and kills the guards herself.<br>
<br>
 * In the books there is no Locke. His role is mostly taken up by Vargo Hoat who at the time was serving Roose Bolton.<br>
<br>
 * Robb attacks and defeats House Westerling, a vassal of House Lannister. Robb is heavily wounded and is treated by Jeyne Westerling.
 When he receives the (false) news of the death of Bran and Rickon he
 is devastated and seeks comfort with Jeyene. To restore her honor (and
 because he fell in love with her) Robb marries Jeyne, and House
 Westerling swears fealty to Robb Stark. Jeyne never got pregnant with
 Robb's child (as far as we know), and she (and her family) were not in
 the Twins when the Red Wedding occurred. She is still alive with her
 family.<br>
<br>
 <strong>The War with Renly Baratheon:</strong><br>
<br>
 * House Florent (King Stannis's in-laws) side with Renly, and only change sides to Stannis when Renly is killed by the Shadow Baby.<br>
<br>
 <strong>The War with Stannis Baratheon:</strong><br>
<br>
 * Ser Davos doesn't start as the Hand of the King. He gets that promotion after he survives the battle of the Black Water.<br>
<br>
 * The seat of House Baratheon, Storm's End, continues to stay loyal to Renly even after his death. And refuses to release either the castle
 or Edric Storm to Stannis. Melisandre releases a second Shadow Baby to
 kill the castellan. Storm's End then falls to Stannis, and Edric is
 captured. It is he (not Gendry) that Mel plans to sacrifice.<br>
<br>
 <strong>Lannisters and Company in King's Landing:</strong><br>
<br>
 * While Lord Varys does tell the story of the sorcerer who cut him to Tyrion, he never captures him.<br>
<br>
 * Sansa is not promised to Loras Tyrell, but to his eldest brother Wylas Tyrell.<br>
<br>
 * Cersie is not engaged to Loras Tyrell either, but her father does plan to marry her off to Oberyn Martell.<br>
<br>
 * Tyrion's face wounds are much more severe, and he loses a large part of his nose.<br>
<br>
 * Bronn, for the most part, abandons Tyrion after he gets a knighthood for his role in the Battle of Blackwater. Tyrion's mountain clansmen
 are also evicted from King's Landing after the battle.<br>
<br>
 * Sansa is much less friendly to Tyrion. During their wedding she refused to kneel so that Tyrion could put his cloak on her.<br>
<br>
 <strong>The Greyjoys:</strong><br>
<br>
 * When Theon captures Winterfell he releases a prisoner named Reek, who slowly becomes his right hand man (taking up the role of TV
 Cleftjaw).<br>
<br>
 * Ser Rodrik Cassel is not captured by Theon. He raises a small army to retake Winterfell. As he lay siege to Winterfell, Reek promises
 Theon that he could bring help if he would release him. Theon does.
 Just as Ser Rodrik is about to attack, a force of Bolton men arrive to 
 join him. But the leader of the Bolton war party betrays Rodrik and
 kills him and the rest of his men. The leader turns out to be Reek
 who reveals himself to be Ramsay Snow. Ramsay had taken the identiy
 of his servant Reek to avoid capture for his many crimes. Ramsay then
 betrays Theon, and kills his men. Winterfell is then torched, and it's
 occupants killed.<br>
<br>
 <strong>Bran and the Reeds:</strong><br>
<br>
 * Jojen and Meera Reed arrive in Winterfell much earlier. They are sent by their father Howland Reed to serve Winterfell.<br>
<br>
 * Bran and Rickon part way much earlier. They are split up as soon as they emerge from the sack of Winterfell.<br>
<br>
 * The Reeds tell a story to Bran called the Knight of the Laughing Tree that hints (among other things) that Ned Stark shared a mutual
 attraction with Lady Asahra Dayne (a long time before he married
 Catelyn).<br>
<br>
 <strong>Arya and the Brotherhood Without Banners:</strong><br>
<br>
 * Melisandere never visited the Brotherhood, and as such never met Arya and Gendry was never given up to her.<br>
<br>
 * Gendry ""friend zoning"" Arya never happens. In fact, we never get explicit confirmation that there's any attraction between the two.<br>
<br>
 * Among the Brotherhood is a former Stark guard who has converted to the Red God whom Arya briefly bonds with.<br>
<br>
 * Also among the brotherhood is Lord Dondarrion's squire Edric Dayne (also called Ned). Edric claims that Jon Snow's mother is a maid name
 Wylla who was also his milk nurse.<br>
<br>
 <strong>The Night's Watch:</strong><br>
<br>
 * Sam is never abandoned by Gren and Dolorous Edd, and he never witnesses the invading forces of the White Walkers the way it happens
 in the TV show. He is, however, in camp at the Fist of the First Men
 when the White Walkers and their Wights attack.<br>
<br>
 * It is during the aftermath of that battle that Sam encounters and kills a White Walker with the obsidian blade. This is witnessed by
 many of his brothers and they start calling him Sam the Slayer.<br>
<br>
 * While Mormont is dying, he requests that Sam contact his son Jorah and ask him to join the Black.<br>
<br>
 * Orell dies when Jon ambushes Ygritte's group. His mind is trapped inside his eagle that attacks Jon much earlier than in the TV show.<br>
<br>
 * Ghost accompanies Jon when he is with the Wildlings.<br>
<br>
 * Tormund Giantsbane doesn't accompany Jon on his climb over the Wall. Instead the raiding party is lead by Styr the Magnar of Thenn.<br>
<br>
 <strong>Daenerys in Essos:</strong><br>
<br>
 * At the beginning of the story, Dany is 13.<br>
<br>
 * Dany's first love making with Drogo is consensual and much more tender.<br>
<br>
 * Doreah doesn't betray Dany, but instead dies of heat exhaustion after Dany is abandoned by the bulk of her Khalassar.<br>
<br>
 * Dany's other handmaidens Irri and Jhiqui are still alive and gossiping.<br>
<br>
 * Dany's bloodriders are also still alive and continue to guard the Khaleesi.<br>
<br>
 * In Qarth, Xaro doesn't betray Dany to the Warlocks (though he doesn't help her either). Dany goes to the Warlock on her own (they
 never kidnapped her dragons). After she destroys the House of the
 Undying, the Qartheen decide to expel her from the city. It is then
 that Arstan (the disguised Ser Barristan) and Strong Belwas arrive
 with a gift of ships for Magister Illyrio. The ships are supposed to
 take her back to Tyrosh, but she redirects them to Slaver's Bay.<br>
<br>
 * Yunkai is never sacked in the books. They surrender their slaves as soon as they realize that the mercenary companies they hired had gone
 over to Dany.  </p>

"37160","Who is Lord Hoster Tully's Tansy?","<p>In his death bed, Lord Hoster Tully speaks in delirium of Tansy. Who is she?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There was a smell of death about that room; a heavy smell, sweet and foul, clinging. It reminded her of the sons that she had lost, her sweet Bran and her little Rickon, slain at the hand of Theon Greyjoy, who had been Ned’s ward. She still grieved for Ned, she would always grieve for Ned, but to have her babies taken as well... “It is a monstrous cruel thing to lose a child,” she whispered softly, more to herself than to her father.</p>
  
  <p>Lord Hoster’s eyes opened. <strong>“Tansy,” he husked in a voice thick with pain.</strong></p>
  
  <p>He does not know me. Catelyn had grown accustomed to him taking her for her mother or her sister Lysa, but Tansy was a name strange to her. “It’s Catelyn,” she said. “It’s Cat, Father.”</p>
  
  <p>“Forgive me... the blood... oh, please... <strong>Tansy</strong>...</p>
  
  <p>Lord Hoster groaned. “Dead.” His hand groped for hers. “You’ll have others... sweet babes, and trueborn.”</p>

"173069","Was Balerion three thousand or two hundred years old?","<p>I am currently rereading <em>A Song Of Ice And Fire</em> and in the first book, <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, I found a confusing section in Tyrion II about the dragon skulls in the throne-room of the Red Keep:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There were nineteen skulls. The oldest was more than three thousand years old; the youngest a mere century and a half. The most recent ones were also the smallest; a matched pair no bigger than mastiff's skuls, and oddly misshapen, all that remained of the last two hatchlings born on Dragonstone. They were the last of the Targaryen dragons, perhaps the last dragons anywhere, and they had not lived very long.</p>
<p>From there the skulls ranged upward in size to the three great monsters of song and story, the dragons that Aegon Targaryen and his sisters had unleashed on the Seven Kingdoms of old. The singers has given them the names of gods: Balerion, Meraxes, Vhaghar.</p>
<p><sub>A Game of Thrones: Tyrion II</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are three bits of information here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The oldest skulls were three thousand years old.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The skulls got smaller over time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The biggest dragon was Balerion.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This implies that the biggest skull is also the oldest, but that would also imply that Balerion was three thousand years old. That seems a bit excessive.</p>
<p>Even Barristan Selmy seems to think so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The squire Whitebeard, standing by the figurehead with one lean hand curled about his tall hardwood staff, turned toward them and said: &quot;Balerion the Black Dread was two hundred years old when he died during the reign of Jaehaerys the Conciliator.&quot;</p>
<p><sub>A Storm of Swords: Daenerys I</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, I wouldn't expect the Targaryens to be importing even bigger, older skulls during their conquest, so I don't see who else would be the prior owner of the skull, other than Balerion.</p>
<p>Are there any additional sources that cite Balerion's age?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><dragons>","173074","<h1>There is no explicit age given. But Barristan Selmy's guess seems to be a good one.</h1>
<p>There is no reason to believe that oldest MUST mean it is also the biggest. Not all the dragons would have died at the same time, some may have died 2900 years ago. But the longer a dragon lives, the larger they get.<sup>1</sup> (All quotes will be compiled at the end).</p>
<p>What we do know?</p>
<ul>
<li>Balerion flew West with Aenar Targaryen before the Doom of Valyria<sup>2</sup>,</li>
<li>Balerion was the largest skull in the throne room, followed by Meraxes and Vhagar<sup>3</sup>,</li>
<li>Meraxes' and Vhagar's skulls were no more than ~415 years old at the time of A Game of Thrones<sup>4</sup>,</li>
<li>Meraxes was no more than 125 years old at the time of its death and yet was the second largest skull<sup>5</sup>,</li>
<li>Balerion died in 94 AC and was at least 220 years old at the time (because he arrived with Aenar)<sup>6</sup>,</li>
<li>Vhagar died in 130 AC and was 182 at the time of its death. It was said to be nearing Balerion's size<sup>7</sup>,</li>
<li>Although the second largest skull in the throne room, Meraxes died at least 60 years before Vhagar<sup>8</sup></li>
</ul>
<p>With all the above information, we can make a reasonable claim that Dragons did not live forever, and that if Vhagar was reaching Balerion's size after 182 years Balerion couldn't be 3000 years old, otherwise he would've been FAR bigger. Balerion is also noted to have been the oldest dragon, meaning dragons were not immortal and died after ~200 years of life. This is given further evidence, since Meraxes, at most 125 years old, was larger than Vhagar and therefore the three skulls must've been similar in size, and within at least a few decades, at most maybe a couple of centuries in age. (Although accounts seem to differ whether Vhagar was larger or smaller than Meraxes <sup>3, 6</sup>)</p>
<p>Therefore Barristan's prediction was likely a good guess for Balerion's age, although not quite exactly right, it was a close bound. Balerion was definitely not 3000 years old and this suggests that the Targaryens had in fact brought Dragon skulls with them before the Doom.</p>

Of course this will be just an exercise of fantasy and imagination, but hey... that's what all of this is about, isn't it?</p>

<p>For my girlfriend's birthday I bought her the cookbook based on the novels, some days later she prepared a meal based on the recipes from the book. We selected a wine from southern Spain and played it was a dornish wine, actually I don't know how dornish wine tastes, but I can tell you it was a wonderful meal.</p>

"37180","Why do the Faith of the Seven allow worship of the old gods?","<p>As a whole, people in ASOIAF are surprisingly tolerant of other religions. Is there a basis for this, or are the people in the Seven Kingdoms too busy killing people over other things to care?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","37188","<p>Very good question.
I think understanding the background is essential to give an answer. In the following chronology, the Year 1 corresponds to the invasion of Aegon the Conqueror.</p>

<p><strong>Before -12 000: Age of Dawn</strong> : basically, only Children of the Forest and giants lived in Westeros. Their religion is the Old Gods.</p>

<p><strong>-12 000: The First Men come into Westeros</strong>, they start a war with the children of the forest, which will last for 2 000 years.</p>

<p><strong>-10 000:</strong> The war is ended by a pact. The pact sets the territory of each people : the children get the forests and the men get the rest. The signature of the pact sets the beginning of the Age of Heroes. <strong>The Old Gods religions is spread among the Men, the Age of Heroes begins.</strong> During the Age of Heroes, the main Houses appear (Stark, Lannister..)</p>

<p><strong>-8 000: The Longest Night begins</strong> It is called the longest night because winter lasted for a whole generation. The Others appear during this winter. Men and Children of the forest ally themselves. Others almost win the war but a hero appear : Azhor Ahai. In short, he discovers obsidian stone and had a magic sword so he was really powerful. After the war, Bran the Builder builds the Wall and the Night's Watch appear. The Free Folks are the descendent of the First Men who happened to live North of the Wall when it was built.</p>

<p>Note that at this time, the religion is still the Old Gods' one.</p>

<p><strong>-6 000: the Andals invade Westeros:</strong> this is the key event to understand to answer the question. The Andals come from the East and invade Westeros. <strong>They bring the Faith of the Seven and spread the Faith of the Seven. But they don't manage to conquer the North quickly because of the powerful fortress Moat Cailin... So the North keeps its religion longer. So the Old Gods religion is stronger in the North.</strong></p>

<p>The events after this one are not really relevant, just note that Aegon the Conqueror led a war and united the seven realms during Year 1, but didn't really care much about religion... he had dragons. He and the rest of the Targaryens didn't originally believe in the Seven. He converted during his invasion to gain the support of the High Septon and the Faith Militant (Thanks to SystemDown's comment for this part). You may not know what is the Faith Militant. This is revealed in <em>A Feast for Crows</em>. Basically, it is composed of people who swear to fight for the Faith.</p>

<p>I think when Aegon conquered the North, one condition of Torrhen Stark's (the last King in the North, at least before Robb) surrending was that his people could keep their gods.</p>

<p>Also, TheMathemagician's comment makes sense : the Faith doesn't hold much power in asoiaf. The king doesn't care which gods you have, as long as you pay your taxes.</p>

"37227","Why doesn't Bran have a wheelchair?","<p>Why would Bran Stark not have a wheelchair? Doran Martell uses one due to his gout, so one would think that a comparable 'technology' would exist in the North. Do we have a sense of whether the terrain in Dorne is just much more wheelchair friendly?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","37234","<p>Wheelchairs are impractical if you don't have paved roads and ramps or elevators instead of stairs everywhere. Possible reasons why it works for Doran Martell:</p>

<ul>
<li>He seems to be content to spend his time thinking and watching, not moving around much. Bran wants to be active.</li>
<li>Chronic gout does not make you completely unable to walk (as opposed to paraplegia): the muscles work and can be controlled, but the joints are damaged and aching. With the help of someone to lean on, Doran is probably able to walk short distances and use stairs.</li>
<li>Gout is a gradually worsening condition, so there was time for him to have buildings modified, or to move to more wheelchair-friendly ones. The book states that he spends most of his time at the Water Gardens, a palace that is described as mostly level ground, quite unlike Winterfell.</li>
</ul>

<p>Futhermore, wheelchairs are probably not widely known at all - Commoners couldn't afford them, Doran's was constructed especially for him, and he explicitly avoids being seen in it since he does not want his enemies to seek him weak. So it's quite possible that nobody in the North has even heard of the concept.</p>

"37587","Game of Thrones' Season 3 - Chapters Adapted from the Book?","<p>Now that <em>Game of Thrones</em> season 3 is over, I'm left wondering how much of <em>A Storm of Swords</em> they were able to adapt. In some <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_(season_3)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sources (Wikipedia)</a> it's stated that ""roughly the first half"" of the book made it into the third season. It'd be interesting to know an exact figure from someone who has both read the book and watched the TV series.</p>

<p>What was the highest-numbered chapter in the third book that they were able to squeeze into the TV series? Up to what chapter was covered for each of the POV characters? (example: Daenerys III, Jon III) No spoilers, please! I'm reading the book <em>before</em> watching the third season.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","37591","<p>It's not a clean break.</p>

<p>Season 3 includes the <em>entirety</em> of some characters/regions plot arcs, while barely touching others. We've seen roughly half of the content, but the order of events has been so jumbled, as to make it impossible to really set a chapter as the point to read up to.</p>

<p>For example, the character of Oberyn Martell has not yet been introduced in the TV series. He <em>has</em> been cast for Season 4 (he hasn't been cut), but his entire narrative arc has been shifted to season 4. Meanwhile, Catelyn and Robb's storyline has entirely resolved itself. There's little-to-nothing left to include in season 4 unless the writers dip into the content of the subsequent novels to keep them in for occasional scenes.</p>

"106568","Why did Thoros of Myr refuse her the Kiss of Life?","<p><strong>Warning: potential spoiler for the viewers of the TV show <em>Game of Thrones</em> : as of season 5, one of the concerned characters has not yet been introduced, and may or may not appear in future seasons of the show</strong></p>

<p>Thoros of Myr, being a red priest of R'hllor, can bring dead people back to life. In a <em>A Feast for Crows</em>, he explains</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> the return of Lady Catelyn Stark as Lady Stoneheart</p>
</blockquote>

<p>to Brienne of Tarth:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""When we found her by the river she was three days dead. Harwin begged me to give her the kiss of life, but it had been too long. I would not do it, so Lord Beric put his lips to hers instead, and the flame of life passed from him to her. And... she rose. May the Lord of Light protect us. She rose.""</p>
  
  <p><sub><em>A Feast for Crows - Chapter 42 (Brienne VIII)</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He explains his refusal with <em>""it had been too long, I would not do it""</em>. But too long for what? I can't interpret whether the <em>""May the Lord of Light protect us""</em> part is the surprise that it actually worked, or the fear of what she became.</p>

<p>Thanks to his experience with Beric Dondarrion, he probably suspect what kind of damage ressurection after a long death can do, so I can see him not wanting to create what could be some kind of soulless monster.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he doesn't seem to have prevented Beric from trying. And doesn't oppose her in becoming the new leader nor leave the Brotherhood after that.</p>

<p>So, do we know what was his deep motive to refuse?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","106572","<blockquote>
  <p>it had been too long.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Every time Thoros had used his power to raise Beric from the dead, it had been within minutes of Beric's death. But Lady Catelyn had been dead and floating down the river for <em>days</em>. As seen in Arya's dream, the wolves were already picking at her corpse when Beric, Thoros, and co. rode up. Thoros must have been nervous to attempt to use his powers on a body that had been dead for so long. He feared what the results might be. He feared the <em>unknown</em>: he's never tried to raise a corpse days after death.</p>

<p>Remember that Thoros had never been much of a priest. He went along with Beric more for the chance to get drunk and run around with a flaming sword than for any sort of religious motivation. Giving the kiss of life was part of a funeral ceremony he gave Beric after his first death, and he was as surprised as anyone when it worked. He probably didn't know much about this power, or didn't remember much of what he'd learned of it. He was OK with raising Beric time after time, under similar circumstances to the first time. But with Catelyn he had no idea what might happen.</p>

<h2>TL;DR: fear of the unknown.</h2>

<p><hr>
As for why he didn't prevent Beric from trying, the short answer is that he <strong>couldn't</strong>. He wasn't in command of Beric; if anything, it was the other way round. Very probably he <em>advised</em> Beric not to try to raise her, perhaps pleaded with him, but in the end Beric is in charge.</p>

<p>And after the fact, he may have seen Catelyn/Stoneheart as <strong>the new embodiment of Beric</strong>; after all, she's walking and breathing only because she received his life force. He could no longer support Beric after his death, so he did the closest thing he could and supported her as the new leader of the Brotherhood. And even if he didn't, why on earth would he leave the Brotherhood? There is still good work to be done, and he can help the Brotherhood to help the smallfolk, regardless of who is in charge.
<hr>
At the end of the day, though, the short answer is <strong>we're not certain</strong>. We never actually saw the scene where Thoros refuses to raise Catelyn and Beric does so, nor the subsequent shift of power in the Brotherhood. We don't know whether Thoros attempted to stop Beric, nor whether he supported Lady Stoneheart as new leader of the Brotherhood. All we know is what's in the short quote you gave in your question. But I think my speculation above is well-founded, and probably the best explanation for what happened.</p>

"37666","Why do people of the realm hate Jaime Lannister?","<p>As I understand it, the people of the realm hate Jaime Lannister because he is a Kingslayer. But he slew the mad King Aerys, who everyone agrees was insane and cruel. This helped Robert to become King, and the realm loves Robert. So, in a way, Jaime did a good deed by slaying the Mad King. Other than that he hasn't broken any oath (that the public knows of). So why do people in general mock and hate him?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","37672","<p>I would not say that Jaime is ""hated"". More like, people who value honour, such as Ned Stark, Barristan Selmy or Brynden ""the Blackfish"" Tully, see him as an oathbreaker, and someone not to be trusted. The ""smallfolk"", i.e. the person on the street, may call him Kingslayer and mock him, painting him as a ""bad guy"", whereas someone like Ser Barristan is considered a good guy. There are many who do not dislike Jaime at all, or who do not simply care what he did to Aerys. Such as Robert himself, who I believe said </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Damn, Ned, someone had to kill Aerys!""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is important to remember, though, that Jaime is also the son of one of the most influential houses in Westeros, and he is (was) skilled at arms and arrogant and rich, which is reason enough for him to attract some scorn, and then ""Kingslayer"" becomes a word to use against him.</p>

<p>It is also important to remember that Jaime is, in fact, worthy of a certain amount of hatred. He did push Bran from the window, trying to kill him, and he did kill Jory Cassel and the other Stark men in King's Landing, just to spite Ned. He did have a sexual relationship with his sister and commit treason against his king (again!), not once, but many times, and he is complicit in the conspiracy to usurp the throne from the rightful king (Robert/Stannis).</p>

<p>While he may have saved the people of King's Landing from the baptism of fire that Aerys planned for them, it does not excuse him from Kingslaying if he does not tell anyone, and just because you get pardoned by a grateful new king does not mean you earned the right to sulk and act like a spoiled brat for decades because you didn't feel like telling anyone about your heroism. </p>

<p>Jaime's story arc is one of redemption, no doubt, and I am guessing that he will eventually do something that will make us readers truly forgive him. And it does seem that it has something to do with Brienne and (Spoiler TV-series season 3+, ASOS)</p>

"37862","Comprehensive Rules for Game of Thrones Lines of Succession","<p>I'm three quarters through the third book, ""Storm of Swords"" right now (so please, no spoilers from too late in the book or any subsequent books).  I just read a part where Tyrion is discussing with Prince Oberyn and they mention the difference between Dornish law and Westerosi law in Line of Succession (ie women can rule under Dornish law).</p>

<p>I'm a little confused trying to puzzle out what the exact LOS rules are.</p>

<p>At first I though it was: at the moment a king/lord dies, to find who holds the title next, you do a depth-first search down the family tree starting with the oldest sibling (ignoring anyone who isn't true-born or has given up their claim ie as Night's Watch or Kingsguard etc.).  Then, for Dornish law you take the first living person and for Westerosi law the first living male person found in this way (so succession can pass through a woman in both cases, but only Dornish law actually allows them to claim the title). If there are no valid living heirs, then you work backwards along the paternal line until you find an ancestor who has living heirs and start from them.</p>

<p>But there were various references to if Sansa's brothers were all dead, then her child would claim Winterfell.  It seems to me that that's only true if somebody else doesn't get it first.  In other words, if Sansa's brothers are killed before she has a child (even if she's already married), doesn't that mean Winterfell would pass to the nearest cousin along her father's line (whomever that may be)?  And then because that cousin has already held Winterfell, when they die the next in the line of succession starts from them so Sansa's children's family would not have claim to Winterfell again unless that cousin has no valid heirs.</p>

<p>What am I missing here? Is there some exception?  Are there no valid cousins?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","37871","<p>Except for the Dornish, Westerosi succession goes like this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Succession goes to the King's eldest male child's <em>line</em>, meaning that even if the eldest male child is dead the succession passed through to his heirs, and only after that line is explored do we go to the next step.</p></li>
<li><p>When a King has no male children or their lines are extinguished, succession goes to the eldest female child's line.</p></li>
<li><p>When a King has no children or their lines are extinguished, we go through the same steps 1 &amp; 2 but among the King's siblings (i.e. His father's children).</p></li>
<li><p>If we still have no heirs we <em>go up a level</em>. In other words we search through the King's grandfather's children. If that fails we continue going up until an heir is found (or we run into a stack-overflow exception ;) )</p></li>
</ol>

<p>However, one must remember that these are ideal world rules. In practice, when the succession gets convoluted by the lack of direct heirs opportunists will rise up claiming succession (usually backed up by a large army).</p>

<p>Since I'm sure a lot of us here are coders (the OP definitely is) here's my attempt at pseudo code implementation. I'm sure it could be done much better, so feel free to fix.</p>

The event of the book 1 will not be in spoiler tags as it happens fairly early, but the reveals from book 5 will.</strong></p>

<p>In book 1, following an order from King Robert, Varys sends a poisoner to sell some poisoned wine to Daenerys. </p>

<p>Jorah Mormont, who by then has fallen in love with Daenerys (come on, this is so obvious that it's not a spoiler..), saves her by spotting the seller's suspicious behavior.</p>

<p>What is really confirmed in book 5 is that </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Mormont was a spy for the council. He betrayed it when he felt in love with Daenerys.</p>

<p><strong>Since Varys could not have possibly known that Jorah Mormont would save the day, why did he actually send the poisoner instead of just saying to King Robert ""I sent him, but he failed"" ?</strong></p>

<p>Am I missing something ? Let me kknow if the question is unclear.</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><game-of-thrones>","37918","<p>The letter that Jorah received from Varys contained a warning about assassination attempts. Varys did not send the poisoner, the poisoner acted on his own accord. Littlefinger tells Ned that he ""saved"" Dany by making the council agree to bestow a lordship on whoever killed Dany, rather than hire a professional (such as a faceless man).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Littlefinger to Ned:] ""After you stormed out, it was left to me to convince them not to hire
  the Faceless Men,"" he continued blithely. ""Instead Varys will quietly
  let it be known that we'll make a lord of whoever does in the
  Targaryen girl.""</p>
  
  <p>Ned was disgusted. ""So now we grant titles to assassins.""</p>
  
  <p>Littlefinger shrugged. ""Titles are cheap. The Faceless Men are
  expensive. If truth be told, I did the Targaryen girl more good than
  you with all your talk of honor. Let some sellsword drunk on visions
  of lordship try to kill her. Likely he'll make a botch of it, and
  afterward the Dothraki will be on their guard. If we'd sent a Faceless
  Man after her, she'd be as good as buried.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CL4PTR4P makes a good point in the comments that Robert does withdraw the assassination order on his death bed, and that <em>might</em> be where the warning to Jorah comes from. Varys was (probably) the one to send the messages about the assassination, but I do not believe he had much choice in the matter: He must be seen to try, or it would cost his life.</p>

<p>I agree though that Varys and Illyrio's behaviour towards Dany and Viserys have been somewhat strange. Especially... (Major spoiler ADWD):</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>..considering the way that they have nurtured, pampered and protected Aegon for years. In contrast, they have let Viserys die, sold Daenerys to the dothraki and more or less abandoned her to live or die.<p>
Because it is clear that they intend for Aegon to rule, considering Varys' speech to Kevan Lannister, it is very strange that they allowed Dany and Viserys to believe that they were the royal heirs. It would be very awkward if they presented Aegon to Viserys... ""So... ehm... here's the <em>real</em> king of Westeros. Would you kindly step aside?""<p>
I am starting to wonder about Bloodraven's involvement, especially considering that he more or less had the same job as Varys in his days. Its been speculated that Varys is a hidden Targaryen, and he does have a shaved head, much like Egg (Aegon V) in the <em>Dunk &amp; Egg</em> novels.</p>

<p>Her pregnancy is discussed in Kings Landing sometime after the Hand's Tourney.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<strong>The whore is pregnant!</strong>&quot; The king's fist slammed down on the council table loud as a thunderclap. &quot;I warned you this would happen, Ned.

<p>The following article mentions that the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/History_of_tourneys_in_Westeros#The_Hand.27s_tourney"" rel=""noreferrer"">Hand's Tourney takes place in 298 AC</a> though I don't know if this is referenced elsewhere. As we know the series starts in 298 AC this would mean Dany more than likely turns 14 in 298 AC placing her birth in 284 AC.</p>
<p>However, for something more concrete Dany mentions she is still 14 when she is following the comet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We follow the comet,&quot; Dany told her khalasar. Once it was said, no word was raised against it. They had been Drogo's people, but they were hers now. The Unburnt, they called her, and Mother of Dragons. Her word was their law.<br />
...<br />
They are not strong, she told herself, so I must be their strength. I must show no fear, no weakness, no doubt. However frightened my heart, when they look upon my face they must see only Drogo's queen. She felt older than her fourteen years. If ever she had truly been a girl, that time was done.<br />
<sub>A Clash of Kings, Daenerys I</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following wiki page asserts that the comet appears in the sky in 299 AC.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first time the Red Comet is mentioned to have been seen, occurs after Rickon Stark has turned 4. Thus all POVs where the Red Comet appears can be said to take place in 299 AC with certainty.<br />

</blockquote>
<p>Note that Rickon is born in the year 295 AC and though I won't go adding quotes here, here's the summary of the calculation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rickon was 3 years old when the direwolves are found and during the welcoming feast at Winterfell. Both events occur in 298 AC, giving the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>2 turning 3 in 298 AC, 3 turning 4 in 299 AC, 4 turning 5 in 300 AC, placing his birth in 295 AC</p>
</li>
<li><p>3 turning 4 in 298 AC, 4 turning 5 in 299 AC, 5 turning 6 in 300 AC, placing his birth in 294 AC</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Rickon was “near four” when Robb left for war, and he was 4 when the news of Ned's death reached Winterfell. Rickon was still four when Theon Greyjoy attacked Winterfell. After the Sack of Winterfell Rickon is still at 4. In 300 AC, Rickon is still 4 years old. This shows that the only correct option for Rickon is 3 turning 4 in 299 AC, placing his birth in 295 AC.<br />

<p>As Dany has now been mentioned to be 14 in both 298 AC and 299 AC she must have been born in 284 AC.</p>

<h1>Game of Thrones</h1>
<h3>282 AL</h3>
<p><sub>Side note: All years on the wikia are given in AL instead of AC. Since answering this question I <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/174759/58193"">asked the following about the change</a>. It turns out that the show committed to AL before AC was confirmed by GRRM as AL was the popular year convention by fans.</sub></p>
<p>Her birth is stated on <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Daenerys_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">her wikia page</a> and is cited as shortly after <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Robert%27s_Rebellion"" rel=""noreferrer"">Robert's Rebellion</a>. Robert's rebellion took place around 280 AL to 282 AL according to the page and so she must have been born in 282 AL or 283 AL. However it is  stated that the rebelleion ended on Dragonstone in 282 AL and as Dany had been born there and fled before the end she must have been born in 282 AL. This also places her age as 16 turning 17 in 298 AL, the start of the show.</p>
<p>The following westeros.org page seems to contradict this saying the following, though I don't know where it is sourced from.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Daenerys has been aged for the show. In the novels, she is 13 when she is first introduced. In Game of Thrones, she is 15 years old. Contacts to give her violet eyes were tried in the pilot, but proved more trouble than they were worth.<br />

</blockquote>
<p>It appears as though they were keeping the birth year the same as the books when the looked into their calculations. However, the following article backs up the wikia stating that Dany is 17 at the start of the show which reinforces her birth in 282 AL, where it is sourced from I don't know.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Age in the books:</strong> In A Game of Thrones (the first book in George RR Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire series), Daenerys is around 13 years old.<br />
<strong>Age in the TV show:</strong> In HBO’s adaptation, it is stated in season one that 17 years have passed since Robert Baratheon’s rebellion – around the time Daenerys was born. It is therefore reasonable to suggest that Daenerys starts the show as a 17 year old. By season six, around five years have passed since the first episode, so we can safely assume that Daenerys is in her early twenties, let’s say, 22 years old. It’s easy to understand why they increased Dany’s age for the show since she had to shoot some pretty uncomfortable and risqué scenes with Khal Drogo from the start of the series.<br />

</blockquote>
<p>GRRM has even gone on record talking about why the show changed the ages and mentions the age increase for the show.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>There was a fair amount of explicit sex in the series and some fans of the books were taken aback.</strong><br />
One of the reasons I wanted to do this with HBO is that I wanted to keep the sex. We had some real problems because Dany is only 13 in the books, and that’s based on medieval history. They didn’t have this concept of adolescence or the teenage years. You were a child or you were an adult. And the onset of sexual maturity meant you were an adult. So I reflected that in the books. But then when you go to film it you run into people going crazy about child pornography and there’s actual laws about how you can’t depict a 13 year old having sex even if you have an 18 year old acting the part — it’s illegal in the United Kingdom. So we ended up with a 22 year old portraying an 18 year old, instead of an 18 year old portraying a 13 year old. If we decided to lose the sex we could have kept the original ages. And once you change the age of one character you have to change the ages of all the characters, and change the date of the war [that dethroned the Mad King]. The fact we made all these changes indicates how important we thought sex was.<br />

Dates for the show appears to be given in BAL and AL meaning (Before) Aegon's Landing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The dating system is based on Aegon the Conqueror's first landing on Westeros which started the Targaryen Conquest. Thus all dates are ""AL"" for Aegon's Landing or ""BAL"" for ""Before Aegon's Landing"".<br>

<p>However, dates in the books are given in BC and AC meaning ""Before the Conquest"" and ""After the Conquest"" respectively.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The maesters of the Citadel who keep the histories of Westeros have used Aegon's Conquest as their touchstone for the past three hundred years. Births, deaths, battles, and other events are dated either AC (After the Conquest) or BC (Before the Conquest).<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice and Fire, The Reign of the Dragons: The Conquest</sub></p>

<p>I had a look around and found an explicit quote from GRRM on the reasoning of the change of dates in the show compared to the books, basically to keep the sex and nudity.</p>

<p>This makes sense as with age changes, other dates need to be changed too so the story still lines up correctly. As such it makes sense that they've changed the year system in the show.</p>

<p>However, I've yet to find any official, or canon, mention of the shows year system as AL. All I've found so far is wikia just using the dates but no mention of where they got it from.</p>

Though they have only speculated on this, this is the best information I can find so far.</p>

<p>@westerosorg The show uses the year system BAL and AL and the books use BC and AC. I can understand the reasoning in the change but I can't find it having been commented on except the wikia. Do you have more insight into this?</p>
<p>Fans assumed &quot;AL&quot; for a long time, until GRRM established BC/AC for TWoIaF. But TWoIaF came after the show, so the writers had already commited to BL/AL I suppose, and that's what a wiki solely dedicated to the TV show reflects<br />

"175057","How is canon determined for the works set in the world of ASOIAF?","<p>George R. R. Martin brought the world of ASOIAF (henceforth called Planetos) to the public when he published his first book <em>A Game of Thrones</em> in 1996. He would go on to write 4 more books over 15 years with at least 2 more in the works. There exists a comic book adaptation which released four volumes in their adaptation of the first book.</p>

<p>The first of his derived works, released in the <em>Legends</em> anthology, was the novella <em>The Hedge Night</em>, which would form the start of <em>The Dunk and Egg Series</em>. He would go on to write two more Novellas in the series with several more in the works. Three other novellas were released, titled <em>The Princess and the Queen</em>, <em>The Rogue Prince, or, the King's Brother</em> and <em>Sons of the Dragon</em>.</p>

<p>Onto other media, there is the award winning TV series which has adapted By David Benioff and D.B Weiss and has since overtaken the books.

  <p>The Lion's Paw / Lion's Tooth business, on the other hand, is intentional. <strong>A small touch of the unreliable narrator.</strong> I was trying to establish that the memories of my viewpoint characters are not infallible. Sansa is simply remembering it wrong. A very minor thing (you are the only one to catch it to date), but it was meant to set the stage for a much more important lapse in memory. You will see, in A STORM OF SWORDS and later volumes, that Sansa remembers the Hound kissing her the night he came to her bedroom... but if you look at the scene, he never does. That will eventually mean something, but just now it's a subtle touch, something most of the readers may not even pick up on.</p>

<p>As an aside: typically in western society from medieval Europe(a heavy basis of morals for GOT) till quite recently, women who cheated on their husbands and became pregnant were either cast out of the family, or they family would cover up the incident.

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><adaptation-comparison>","175787","<h1>No</h1>
<p>George R. R. Martin has written on his Not A Blog about this subject where he states that though the Iron Throne is iconic and he does like the way it is shown in the show it's not what he had in mind. However, he does state that there are good reasons why the show couldn't use the version he had in mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And yet, and yet... <strong>it's still not right.</strong> It's not the Iron Throne I see when I'm working on THE WINDS OF WINTER. It's not the Iron Throne I want my readers to see. <strong>The way the throne is described in the books... HUGE, hulking, black and twisted, with the steep iron stairs in front, the high seat from which the king looks DOWN on everyone in the court... my throne is a hunched beast looming over the throne room, ugly and assymetric...</strong></p>
<p>The HBO throne is none of those things. It's big, yes, but not nearly as big as the one described in the novels. And for good reason. We have a huge throne room set in Belfast, but <strong>not nearly huge enough to hold the Iron Throne as I painted it.</strong> For that we'd need something much bigger, more like <strong>the interior of St. Paul's Cathedral or Westminster Abbey, and no set has that much room.</strong> The Book Version of the Iron Throne would not even fit through the doors of the Paint Hall.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>He also goes on to talk about what his version should look like, but still the version he includes, as a picture from the calendar, isn't exactly how he wants it to be it does come close.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That's the Iron Throne as painted by the amazing Marc Simonetti (and if you haven't gotten his 2013 Ice &amp; Fire calendar, better hurry, the year's half over) for the upcoming concordance, THE WORLD OF ICE &amp; FIRE. It's a rough, not a final version, so what you see in the book will be more polished. <strong>But Marc has come closer here to capturing the Iron Throne as I picture it than any other artist to tackle it.</strong> From now on, THIS will be the reference I give to every other artist tackling a throne room scene. This Iron Throne is massive. Ugly. Assymetric. It's a throne made by blacksmiths hammering together half-melted, broken, twisted swords, wrenched from the hands of dead men or yielded up by defeated foes... a symbol of conquest... <strong>it has the steps I describe, and the height.</strong> From on top, the king dominates the throne room. And there are thousands of swords in it, not just a few.</p>
<p>This Iron Throne is scary. And not at all a comfortable seat, just as Aegon intended.</p>
<p>Look on his works, ye mighty, and despair.</p>

<p>Martin has since said the same thing in a panel interview but offers slightly more insight into how tall it is supposed to be.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I said repeatedly the Iron Throne is huge. It towers over the room like a great beast. And it's ugly. It's asymmetric. It's put together by blacksmiths not by craftsmen and experts in furniture manufacturing. <strong>You have to walk the iron steps, and when a king sits on it he's like 10 feet above everybody else</strong> ... He's in this raised position looking down on everyone.</p>

<p>Eddard's description in the books also doesn't fit the show as the amount of blades doesn't match nor does it's dangerousness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ned could feel cold steel against his fingers as he leaned forward. Between each finger was a blade, <strong>the points of twisted swords fanning out like talons from arms of the throne.</strong> Even after three centuries, some were still sharp enough to cut. The Iron Throne was full of traps for the unwary. The songs said it had taken <strong>a thousand blades to make it, heated white-hot in the furnace breath of Balerion the Black Dread.</strong> The hammering had taken fifty-nine days. The end of it was <strong>this hunched black beast made of razor edges and barbs and ribbons of sharp metal;</strong> a chair that could kill a man, and had, if the stories could be believed.</p>
<p><sup>A Game of Thrones, Eddard XI</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later on Eddard notes about the steps down from the seat atop the Iron Throne.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alyn and Porther climbed the <strong>steep iron steps to help him back down.</strong> As they made their descent, he could feel Loras Tyrell's sullen stare, but the boy had stalked away before Ned reached the floor of the throne room.</p>
<p><sup>A Game of Thrones, Eddard XI</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that the steps in the books are also taller than the whole chair in the show, implied from this quote.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Tywin rose to his feet. &quot;We continue,&quot; he said in a clear strong voice that silenced the murmurs. &quot;Those who wish to ask pardon for their treasons may do so. We will have no more follies.&quot; <strong>He moved to the Iron Throne and there seated himself on a step, a mere three feet off the floor.</strong></p>
<p><sup>A Clash of Kings, Sansa VIII</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The height of the Iron Throne is again implied in the following quotes and a higher throne means more swords gone into it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Her prince—no, her king now!—<strong>took the steps of the Iron Throne two at a time</strong>, while his mother was seated with the council.</p>
<p><sup>A Game of Thrones, Sansa V</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You let my father die,&quot; Joffrey said accusingly from <strong>atop the Iron Throne.</strong> &quot;You're too old to protect anybody.&quot;</p>
<p><sup>A Game of Thrones, Sansa V</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>height of the Iron Throne</strong> gave Joffrey a better vantage point than anyone else in the hall. He was the first to see her. &quot;Come forward, my lady,&quot; he called out, smiling.</p>
<p><sup>A Game of Thrones, Sansa V</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From Tyrion's perspective it is especially high, making him cramp as he climbs it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Iron Throne of Aegon the Conqueror was a tangle of nasty barbs and jagged metal teeth waiting for any fool who tried to sit too comfortably, and <strong>the steps made his stunted legs cramp as he climbed up to it</strong>, all too aware of what an absurd spectacle he must be. Yet there was one thing to be said for it. <strong>It was high</strong>.</p>
<p><sup>A Clash of Kings, Tyrion VI</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>The show even makes at least 2 jokes about the Iron Throne being different. The first is mentioned by Skooba below and is in Season 3 in an exchange between Littlefinger and Varys.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Varys:</strong> 1000 blades taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies, forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread.</p>
<p><strong>Littlefinger:</strong> There aren't There aren't even 200. I've counted.</p>
<p><strong>Varys:</strong> Ha, I'm sure you have. Ugly old thing. Yet it has a certain appeal. The Lysa Arryn of chairs. Shame you had to settle for your second choice.</p>
<p><sub><em>Game of Thrones</em>, Season 3 Episode 6, &quot;the Climb&quot;</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second is in the final episode of the series when Dany is talking to Jon in the now mostly destroyed Red Keep.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Daenerys:</strong> When I was a girl, my brother told me it was made with 1000 swords from Aegon's fallen enemies. What do 1000 swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can't count to 20? I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb. So many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of Aegon's feet.</p>

"40014","What is the difference between the glamors used by Melisandre and the Faceless Men?","<p>I am trying to understand the differences between/among the glamors used by Melssandre and the Faceless Men in ASOIAF.</p>

<p>In AFFC Arya and ""the kindly man"" have this exchange:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> “...Jaqen used magic.”<br>
 “All sorcery comes at a cost, child. Years of prayer and sacrifice and study are required to work a proper glamor.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maester Aemon to Sam</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> ...we all deceive ourselves, when we want to believe. Melisandre most of all, I think. The sword is wrong, she has to know that... light without heat... an empty glamor... the sword is wrong, and the false light can only lead us deeper into darkness</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In ADWD Melisandre describes the nature of the glamor she used</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> “The spell is made of shadow and suggestion. Men see what they expect to see. The bones are part of that.” Was I wrong to spare this one? “If the glamor fails, they will kill you.”  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>She later says to Mance and Jon Snow</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> ""The strongest glamors are built of such things. A dead man’s boots, a hank of hair, a bag of fingerbones. With whispered words and prayer, a man’s shadow can be drawn forth from such and draped about another like a cloak. The wearer’s essence does not change, only his seeming."" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, when Arya first changes her face, it is described as something beyond a simple glamor:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> “Mummers change their faces with artifice,” the kindly man was saying, “and sorcerers use glamors, weaving light and shadow and desire to make illusions that trick the eye. These arts you shall learn, but what we do here goes deeper. Wise men can see through artifice, and glamors dissolve before sharp eyes, but the face you are about to don will be as true and solid as that face you were born with. Keep your eyes closed.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, my question is what are these different types of glamors? If Jaqen's was indeed a glamor, how was it different from what Arya does at the temple?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","40017","<p>If I recall correctly, the only magic that Jaqen was shown to have used was changing his appearance.  Given that the appearance he chooses seems to be more than a short-term single disguise, it seems extremely likely that he used the same technique the kindly man showed Arya (or a variant thereof).</p>

<p>The technique the kindly man uses is clearly identified as more than just a glamor.</p>

<p>In the first exchange between Arya and the kindly man that you quoted, it seems to imply that the magic Jaqen use is a ""proper glamor"", but the context lends itself to another interpretation.</p>

<p>When they have the conversation, </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Arya is asking to be taught how to use magic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The kindly man's response is pointing out that if she wants to do this, it will not be as simple as being told a secret, but will instead require years of dedication, learning, and practice.  In that context, perhaps the kindly man is only using ""a proper glamor"" as a reference point, meaning ""even basic magic takes 
years to learn"", instead of ""the magic you want me to teach you takes years to learn"".</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Indeed, Arya has undergone many months of training before she is given a new face, and that new face is only given to her as part of her initiation test.  It is only after completing this test that she is considered ready to be an apprentice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This kind of makes sense when you consider that the kindly man seems to go out of his way to obscure the training that Arya is undergoing (i.e. many of the things he has her do don't seem like training until after the fact, much like ""wax on, wax off"" from <em>The Karate Kid</em>). </p>

<p>In general, the techniques and magic employed by the Faceless Men seem to rely upon deep understanding and thorough knowledge.  This is why </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> much of Arya's training involves learning such diverse skills such as reading body language, being able to tell when someone is lying, being able to lie well, gaining basic control over her own facial muscles, and pharmacology.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Their magics seem (from our limited knowledge) to focus more on subtlety, and supplementing other, non-magical skills.</p>

<p>By contrast, Melisandre seems to rely more on ""flashier"" magic.  Illusions to change appearance.  Exchanging life energy for power.  Using powders and special smokes to make herself seem more mysterious.  She is very aware of how other perceive her, and has even outright stated that she believes the more effortless the sorcery appears, the more men fear the sorcerer.</p>

<p>Melisandre is a shadowbinder and sorceress, so when the kindly man is talking about ""weaving light and shadow and desire to make illusions that trick the eye"", it is a pretty clear indication that glamors like the one she uses </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> on Mance Rayder and Rattleshirt</p>
</blockquote>

<p>are simpler than the Faceless Men's techniques (although what Melisandre does is by no means simple).</p>

<p>So it is possible that what Jaqen did was not a glamor at all, but rather some more advanced technique.  However, if what Jaqen did was, in fact, a glamor, it was probably merely a temporary measure until he could ""properly"" change his face into the more long-term disguise.  It is pretty clear that a glamor is not as comprehensive as a disguise as to what is used on Arya, and even what is used on Arya is described as crude by comparison to the more advanced techniques.</p>

<p>I have tweeted Elio and Linda of westeros.org and they have come back saying we have no known date for the coronation.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Robert_I_Baratheon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wiki page on Robert</a> has this to say about his coronation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In late 283 AC, Robert was crowned king.</p>

<p>It gives no extra information on the date. However, we can also deduce that it must have been late 283 AC from the following information.</p>

<p>Joffrey wishes to be crowned within a fortnight and so must believe that the preparations are possible for this to happen. He says it as if it's possible but not always the case so I'd say 2-4 weeks of preparation is probably normal.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Joffrey stood. His red satin cape was patterned in gold thread; fifty roaring lions to one side, fifty prancing stags to the other. ""I command the council to make all the necessary arrangements for my coronation,"" the boy proclaimed. ""<strong>I wish to be crowned within the fortnight.</strong> Today I shall accept oaths of fealty from my loyal councillors.""<br>

<p>Daeron Targaryen was crowned within the 2-4 week window as well after learning of his fathers death and that includes travelling to and from Dragonstone so it certainly seems possible.</p>

  <p>His son and heir, <strong>Prince Daeron, departed Dragonstone within the fortnight after learning of his father's demise and was swiftly crowned</strong> by the High Septon in the Red Keep. He chose to be crowned with his father's crown—a decision likely intended to quell any remaining doubts about his legitimacy.<br>

<p>The <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Sack_of_King%27s_Landing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sack of King's Landing</a> was in 283 AC and was a race by the main rebellion forces of Baratheon/Stark/Arryn/Tully and the Lannister forces to who would get their first. The Lannister forces beat them there and were shortly followed by the main force. This force was led by Eddard Stark as Robert was injured and so we can assume that Robert needed extra time to get there. He would also need time to heal a bit as an injured king at his own coronation wouldn't be the best sight.</p>

<p>With all this information I'd speculate that Robert was crowned within 6-8 weeks of the Sack of King's Landing.</p>

<h1>Game of Thrones</h1>

<p>I won't repeat stuff here as most of the information is the same as the books including Joffrey wanting to be crowned within the fortnight.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Joffrey Baratheon: I command the council to make all necessary arrangements for my coronation. <strong>I wish to be crowned within the fortnight.</strong> Today I shall accept oaths of fealty from my loyal councillors.<br>

"109569","Is there any mention of mathematicians in Westeros?","<p>I'm thinking people in Westeros and Essos know or ought to know maths such as basic geometry and probability and maybe some basics of finance, economics, physics, engineering, technology, medicine or statistics</p>

<blockquote>

<p>However, I find the profession of theoretical mathematician to be kind of useless in a place like Westeros (or Essos, <a href=""http://shingekinokyojin.wikia.com/wiki/Walls"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wall Maria</a>, <a href=""http://walkingdead.wikia.com/wiki/Alexandria_Safe-Zone_(TV_Series)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Alexandria Safe-Zone</a>).</p>
<p>Theoretical mathematicians today study things like algebraic geometry, number theory, probability theory, functional analysis, harmonic analysis, etc.</p>
<p>There are of course statisticians and applied mathematicians whose research are used in finance, economics, physics, engineering, technology, medicine, statistics and the like.</p>
<p>My guess is that 'mathematician' is a broad term used to encompass experts in finance, economics, physics, engineering, technology, medicine or statistics much like a 'philosopher' in ancient times studied a lot of things including maths, physics and economics.</p>
<p>Perhaps Littlefinger in that scene means 'statistician'.</p>
<p>Any other mention of maths as a study or the profession of 'mathematician' in the books or series? Any word from GRRM or Benioff &amp; Weiss on what it means for a Westerosi (or Essosi) to be a 'mathematician' ?</p>

<p>The place for the study of abstract mathematics would surely be the Citadel, where maesters are educated. But so far we have seen very little of what goes on in the Citadel in either the books or the TV show (this may be updated in the future). As far as we know currently, maesters can earn the following types of links in their chain:</p>

<p>Note that we do not know the type of study associated with all these metals, and that there may well be other types of metal links not included in this list. It's quite plausible that the maesters in the Citadel, who are essentially cloistered academics, have taken the study of mathematics far beyond what is required for accountancy, land surveying, war, etc. - but this is currently <strong>unknown</strong> in book/TV canon.</p>

<p>In the chapter where Roose Bolton finally assumes control over Harrenhal, he asks Arya for her true name. Even though Bolton is an ally of Winterfell, and the Stark banner is raised in the castle, she decides to remain anonymous, calling herself Nymeria. </p>

"247498","What does the training of the faceless men contain?","<p>We've seen Arya training with the Faceless men in Braavos. It was mostly serving, telling lies (the game she played with the waif) and fighting. But what does the training consist of to become a Faceless Men?</p>
<p>We see her, as an example, kill the Freys with poison and she was, when she was imitating Walder Frey, speaking with a different voice. So, what does the training to become a Faceless men include?</p>
<p>What I know so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fighting (when fighting Brienne, she says that 'no one' has taught her to fight like that, I understood it as a reference to Jaqen H'gar)</li>
<li>Lying (Game with the waif)</li>
<li>Acting (When she imitated the servant when killing Walder Frey and imitating Walder Frey)</li>
<li>Poisons (this is just an assumption, as she's killed the Freys with poison and I don't see anywhere else she could've learned this skill)</li>
<li>Handling dead people (we see her wash / prepare the dead)</li>
<li>Remove the face to be used later (Arya removed the face of the Waif, therefore needed the proper training)</li>

<p>Going by both tags being used I am going to cross-reference the show to the books as you seem to be well versed in show lore.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Fighting</strong></p>
<p>Arya is trained with a stick (I'd say like a Bo staff) while she is blind to learn how to tell where opponent is without seeing them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And moving. She stepped to one side, grabbed for her stick, snapped it up to protect her face. Wood clacked against wood. The force of the blow almost knocked the stick from her hand. She held on, slashed back … and found only empty air where he should have been. &quot;Not there,&quot; the voice said. &quot;Are you blind?&quot;</p>
<p>She did not answer. Talking would only muddle any sounds he might be making. He would be moving, she knew. Left or right? She jumped left, swung right, hit nothing. A stinging cut from behind her caught her in the back of the legs. &quot;Are you deaf?&quot; She spun, the stick in her left hand, whirling, missing. From the left she heard the sound of laughter. She slashed right.</p>
<p>This time she connected. Her stick smacked off his own. The impact sent a jolt up her arm. &quot;Good,&quot; the voice said.</p>
<p><sub><em>A Dance with Dragons - The Blind Girl</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Lying</strong></p>
<p>Lying is one of the first skills Arya learns from both &quot;the kindly man&quot; and &quot;the waif&quot;. This continues for most of her training.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You lie,&quot; said the waif. &quot;You must lie gooder.&quot;</p>
<p>Arya laughed. &quot;Gooder? You mean better, stupid.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Better stupid. I will show you.&quot;</p>
<p>The next day they began the lying game, asking questions of one another, taking turns. Sometimes they would answer truly, sometimes they would lie. The questioner had to try and tell what was true and what was false. The waif always seemed to know. Arya had to guess. Most of the time she guessed wrong.</p>
<p><sub><em>A Feast for Crows - Arya II</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Acting</strong></p>
<p>Arya goes through a few &quot;roles&quot; during training notably &quot;Cat of the Canals&quot; and &quot;Beth&quot;. She uses these disguises to infiltrate different parts of Braavos.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Poisons</strong></p>
<p>Arya helps the waif prepare poisons and the waif teaches her what to smell for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Her part was mostly fetching, scrambling up ladders to find the herbs and leaves the waif required. &quot;Sweetsleep is the gentlest of poisons,&quot; the waif told her, as she was grinding some with a mortar and pestle. &quot;A few grains will slow a pounding heart and stop a hand from shaking, and make a man feel calm and strong. A pinch will grant a night of deep and dreamless sleep. Three pinches will produce that sleep that does not end. The taste is very sweet, so it is best used in cakes and pies and honeyed wines. Here, you can smell the sweetness.&quot; She let her have a whiff, then sent her up the ladders to find a red glass bottle. &quot;This is a crueler poison, but tasteless and odorless, hence easier to hide. The tears of Lys, men call it. Dissolved in wine or water, it eats at a man's bowels and belly, and kills as a sickness of those parts. Smell.&quot; Arya sniffed, and smelled nothing. The waif put the tears to one side and opened a fat stone jar. &quot;This paste is spiced with basilisk blood. It will give cooked flesh a savory smell, but if eaten it produces violent madness, in beasts as well as men. A mouse will attack a lion after a taste of basilisk blood.&quot;</p>
<p><sub><em>A Feast for Crows - Cat Of The Canals</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Handling dead people</strong></p>
<p>This is essential task of Arya's time as an acolyte. She assists visitors to the House of Black and White receive their &quot;gift&quot;. Their bodies are taken to the crypts where they are further processed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dead were never hard to find. They came to the House of Black and White, prayed for an hour or a day or a year, drank sweet dark water from the pool, and stretched out on a stone bed behind one god or another. They closed their eyes, and slept, and never woke. &quot;The gift of the Many-Faced God takes myriad forms,&quot; the kindly man told her, &quot;but here it is always gentle.&quot; When they found a body he would say a prayer and make certain life had fled, and Arya would fetch the serving men, whose task it was to carry the dead down to the vaults. There acolytes would strip and wash the bodies. The dead men's clothes and coins and valuables went into a bin for sorting. Their cold flesh would be taken to the lower sanctum where only the priests could go; what happened in there Arya was not allowed to know.</p>
<p><sub><em>A Feast for Crows - Arya II</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Removing Faces</strong></p>
<p>She learns this process as she goes through her own transformation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Still as stone, she thought. She sat unmoving. The cut was quick, the blade sharp. By rights the metal should have been cold against her flesh, but it felt warm instead. She could feel the blood washing down her face, a rippling red curtain falling across her brow and cheeks and chin, and she understood why the priest had made her close her eyes. When it reached her lips the taste was salt and copper. She licked at it and shivered.</p>
<p>&quot;Bring me the face,&quot; said the kindly man. The waif made no answer, but she could hear her slippers whispering over the stone floor. To the girl he said, &quot;Drink this,&quot; and pressed a cup into her hand. She drank it down at once. It was very tart, like biting into a lemon. A thousand years ago, she had known a girl who loved lemon cakes. No, that was not me, that was only Arya.</p>
<p>&quot;Mummers change their faces with artifice,&quot; the kindly man was saying, &quot;and sorcerers use glamors, weaving light and shadow and desire to make illusions that trick the eye. These arts you shall learn, but what we do here goes deeper. Wise men can see through artifice, and glamors dissolve before sharp eyes, but the face you are about to don will be as true and solid as that face you were born with. Keep your eyes closed.&quot; She felt his fingers brushing back her hair. &quot;Stay still. This will feel queer. You may be dizzy, but you must not move.&quot;</p>
<p>Then came a tug and a soft rustling as the new face was pulled down over the old. The leather scraped across her brow, dry and stiff, but as her blood soaked into it, it softened and turned supple. Her cheeks grew warm, flushed. She could feel her heart fluttering beneath her breast, and for one long moment she could not catch her breath. Hands closed around her throat, hard as stone, choking her. Her own hands shot up to claw at the arms of her attacker, but there was no one there. A terrible sense of fear filled her, and she heard a noise, a hideous crunching noise, accompanied by blinding pain. A face floated in front of her, fat, bearded, brutal, his mouth twisted with rage. She heard the priest say, &quot;Breathe, child. Breathe out the fear. Shake off the shadows. He is dead. She is dead. Her pain is gone. Breathe.&quot;</p>
<p>The girl took a deep shuddering breath, and realized it was true. No one was choking her, no one was hitting her. Even so, her hand was shaking as she raised it to her face. Flakes of dried blood crumbled at the touch of her fingertips, black in the lantern light. She felt her cheeks, touched her eyes, traced the line of her jaw. &quot;My face is still the same.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is it? Are you certain?&quot;</p>
<p>Was she certain? She had not felt any change, but maybe it was not something you could feel. She swept a hand down across her face from top to bottom, as she had once seen Jaqen H'ghar do, back at Harrenhal. When he did it, his whole face had rippled and changed. When she did it, nothing happened.</p>
<p>&quot;It feels the same.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To you,&quot; said the priest. &quot;It does not look the same.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To other eyes, your nose and jaw are broken,&quot; said the waif. &quot;One side of your face is caved in where your cheekbone shattered, and half your teeth are missing.&quot;</p>
<p>She probed around inside her mouth with her tongue, but found no holes or broken teeth. Sorcery, she thought. I have a new face. An ugly, broken face.</p>

<p>From <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, chapter 66, <em>Bran</em> (all emphasis added):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Summer stalked out in the echoing gloom, then stopped, lifted his head, and sniffed the chill dead air. He bared his teeth and crept backward, eyes glowing golden in the light of the maester's torch. Even Osha, hard as old iron, seemed uncomfortable. &quot;Grim folk, by the look of them,&quot; she said as she eyed the long row of granite Starks on their stone thrones.</p>
<p>&quot;They were the Kings of Winter,&quot; Bran whispered. Somehow it felt wrong to talk too loudly in this place.</p>
<p>Osha smiled. &quot;Winter's got no king. If you'd seen it, you'd know that, summer boy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They were the <strong>Kings in the North for thousands of years</strong>,&quot; Maester Luwin said, lifting the torch high so the light shone on the stone faces. Some were hairy and bearded, shaggy men fierce as the wolves that crouched by their feet. Others were shaved clean, their features gaunt and sharp-edged as the iron longswords across their laps. &quot;Hard men for a hard time. Come.&quot; He strode briskly down the vault, past the procession of stone pillars and <strong>the endless carved figures</strong>. A tongue of flame trailed back from the upraised torch as he went.</p>
<p>The vault was cavernous, longer than Winterfell itself, and Jon had told him once that there were <strong>other levels underneath, vaults even deeper and darker where the older kings were buried</strong>. It would not do to lose the light. Summer refused to move from the steps, even when Osha followed the torch, Bran in her arms.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you recall your history, Bran?&quot; the maester said as they walked. &quot;Tell Osha who they were and what they did, if you can.&quot;</p>
<p>He looked at the passing faces and the tales came back to him. The maester had told him the stories, and Old Nan had made them come alive. &quot;That one is <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jon_Stark"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>Jon Stark</strong></a>.

He fought with Prince Aemon once, and the Dragonknight said he'd never faced a finer swordsman.&quot; <strong>They were almost at the end now</strong>, and Bran felt a sadness creeping over him. &quot;And there's my grandfather, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rickard_Stark"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>Lord Rickard</strong></a>, who was beheaded by Mad King Aerys.

<p>From this description we can see that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>starting from the stairwell, they see very old kings first, from hundreds or thousands of years ago</p>
</li>
<li><p>the kings and lords mentioned seem appear in chronological order</p>
</li>
<li><p>the most recently deceased are right at the end - this is confirmed by an earlier chapter from Ned's point of view:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ned stopped at last and lifted the oil lantern. The crypt continued on into darkness ahead of them, but beyond this point the tombs were empty and unsealed; black holes waiting for their dead, waiting for him and his children. [...] There were three tombs, side by side. Lord Rickard Stark, Ned's father, had a long, stern face. [...] In two smaller sepulchres on either side were his children.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this taken together pretty much confirms that the statues and tombs are arranged <strong>in order of age</strong>. As for the numbers, we see in the long quote above that there are thousands of years' worth of kings, enough to fill more than the entire length of Winterfell on one level, with even more on lower levels. <strong>Several hundred statues</strong> would be a conservative estimate.</p>

"177217","Can a non-Targaryen ride a dragon?","<p>We see lot of speculation about who will ride Daenerys' dragons.</p>

<p>One of the candidates is Tyrion, but he is not a Targaryen. Jon Snow is also a candidate, but he is only half-Targaryen.</p>

<p>I am not here for speculation, but to ask a simple question:  </p>

<p><strong><em>Must one be a (pure) Targaryen to ride dragons?</em></strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","177222","<p><strong>TL;DR :</strong> Noble dragonriders may not have been exclusively Targaryen but all were Valyrian. Furthermore, there have been some bastard dragonriders, called dragonseeds, of unknown origin.</p>

<p><strong>Long answer :</strong> </p>

<p>There is a little bit of speculation in the answer, as it is not etched in stone that one can ride a dragon only if he is valyrian, but as there is a limited amount of dragons and dragonriders, we know individually each dragonriders (at least in post-doom era)</p>

<p>As far as I know, all known noble dragonriders where Valyrian. There are also some bastards who became dragonriders, called <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragonseed"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dragonseeds</a> ( bastards of House Targaryen as well as House Velaryon), even though we are not 100% sure of their origin.</p>

<p>Of course, the Targaryen are the most famous dragonriders, but there are others as well.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jaenara_Belaerys"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Jaenara Belaerys</a> flew over Sothoryos with his dragon.</li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aurion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Aurion, Emperor of Valyria</a>, is a famous dragonlord that survived the Doom of Valyria, proclaimed himself Emperor of Valyria, and tried to reestablish the Freehold. </li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Velaryon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">House Velaryon</a>, A Valyrian noble House who, like the Targaryan, left Valyria before the Doom. They are allied with Targaryens, and there have been a number of dragonriders from this house.</li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragonseed"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dragonseeds</a>, alleged Valyrian bastards who became dragonriders during the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dance_of_the_Dragons"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dance of the Dragons</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The only potential non-Valyrian dragonriders are the dragonseeds, because we don't really know the lineage of those bastards. </p>

<p>Usually, the term of dragonseed is used for Targaryan and Velaryon bastards, but the term was also used to call the dragonriders during the dance of the dragons. </p>

<p>Long story short, there was a civil war between Targaryens, and the black (Rhaenyra Targaryen's loyalists) had more dragons than dragonriders. Prince <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jacaerys_Velaryon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Jacaerys Velaryon</a> offered lands, riches, and knighthood to any such ""seeds"" that could master a dragon. A lot of men tried, a lot of men failed. </p>

<p>Those who succeeded were known as dragonseeds, but we don't know for sure if they were all Targaryens/ Velaryons or if it's their alleged Valyrian blood which enabled them to ride a dragon.

"41519","Why did Ser Gregor kill Ser Hugh?","<p>During the Tournament in honour of Ned Starks appointment to Hand of the King (<em><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tourney_of_the_Hand"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Tourney of The Hand</a></em>), Ser Gregor kills <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Hugh"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ser Hugh of the Vale</a> in what seems to be an accident.<br>
However, both Ned Stark and Ser Gregor's brother - Sandor ""The Hound"" Clegane - seem to think that this was not an accident, and we are also lead to believe that it is not. Ned Stark seems to think that Ser Hugh was killed because Ned had wanted to question him.</p>

<p>However, in retrospect (ASOS), we know that it was not Cersei who killed Jon Arryn, we only know that she suspected that Jon Arryn and Stannis knew the secret of who really fathered her children. </p>

<p>I can imagine that Cersei would possibly have had Ser Hugh killed, just in case he actually knew something that she suspected Jon Arryn or Stannis might have suspected, but why would she do it at that time? And why use Ser Gregor in that case? </p>

<p>Looking back at it now, it seems that it is more likely that this was purely coincidental. If Cersei had suspected that Ser Hugh knew <em>anything</em>, she would have had him killed right away. And frankly, it could have been done at any time, and not at the tournament in front of half of King's Landing, done by her own father's bannerman.</p>

<p><strong>What was the reason for Ser Gregor killing Ser Hugh?</strong></p>

<p>Anything is possible, but I prefer having some evidence to support speculation. My personal opinion is that Ser Gregor would not take killing orders from just anyone. The man is not an idiot. It would have to be a Lannister, or someone like Pycelle who is a Lannister loyalist. </p>

<p>It seems that GRRM has left this particular event unexplained, when so many other events were actually explained. For example, we heard who sent the assassin to kill Bran, we have some clue as to what Ned promised Lyanna, we know who poisoned Jon Arryn and who gave the order, we know that Cersei tried to have all of Robert's bastards killed, etc. But no hint as to why this incident happened, besides the obvious?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","42541","<p>This is pure speculation - and based on circumstantial evidence - but I suspect it was actually Littlefinger who was the orchestrator of Hugh's death. Firstly (and this is purely circumstantial), he adequately blocks Ned's first attempt to question Hugh. If you'll remember, when Ned announces his intentions to question Ser Hugh, it is Littlefinger who persuades him that he has to tread carefully. He advises Ned to send a trusted advisor to talk to Hugh, rather than go himself. Now, Littlefinger is an accomplished player of ""the game"" and I'm sure he would therefore have known all about the prickly disposition of Ser Hugh, and that he wouldn't answer the questions put to him by Jory (bit of a stretch here maybe, but I do think it extremely likely that Littlefinger would have known this). </p>

<p>Therefore it is my opinion that what initially appears to the reader to be helpful advice from Littlefinger (that Ned should question Ser Hugh but do so carefully) is now (in view of what we subsequently learn about him) revealed to be a skilful manipulation of someone unaccustomed to the game - and it is a great delaying tactic in terms of preventing Ned from actually learning anything from Ser Hugh. Now Littlefinger knows he has to resolve the situation before Ned can speak to Ser Hugh - and he has just enough time to set up the killing at the Tourney by Ser Gregor. Remember Clegane's status as an unpredictable wildcard here - given his nature it wouldn't have taken much convincing to get Ser Gregor to kill someone, so we needn't assume that he was acting to kill Ser Hugh on the orders of Cersei. Perhaps even the mere suggestion that the (unjustly) arrogant and jumped-up Ser Hugh should be cut down would be enough to get Ser Gregor to carry out the act.</p>

<p>So this leave Littlefinger's motivations as the loose end. Why does he need to do any of this? Well, we know that he wanted Arryn out of the way in order to marry his wife Lisa and later lay claim to the Vale. But we also know that, contrary to what he tells Lisa, Jon is not the only obstacle to his marrying her - what he needs is a title. At this moment he is still lowly Petyr Baelish of the Fingers. He won't become a viable suitor for her hand in marriage until he is nominated as Lord of Harrenhal, and for that to happen he is reliant on Cersei and her offspring maintaining their grip on the throne in the short term. What Arryn might have surmised about the Lannister children thus represented a severe threat to Littlefinger's plans - so perhaps Ser Hugh's killing wasn't necessary to protect Cersei and the Lannisters per se, but rather necessary to protect the Lannisters for the benefit of Littlefinger. A case of interests being aligned rather than the agency of one individual (Cersei) demanding the death of someone like Ser Hugh.</p>

"177498","Is Tobho Mott really Qohorik?","<p>Tobho Mott's name speaks for itself, it simply isn't Westerosi. </p>

<p>From the man's own accounts, he spent his youth in Qohor. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ned sipped his wine and let the man go on. The Knight of Flowers
  bought all his armor here, Tobho boasted, and many high lords, the
  ones who knew fine steel, and even Lord Renly, the king's own brother.
  Perhaps the Hand had seen Lord Renly's new armor, the green plate with
  the golden antlers? No other armorer in the city could get that deep a
  green; he knew the secret of putting color in the steel itself, paint
  and enamel were the crutches of a journeyman. Or mayhaps the Hand
  wanted a blade? <strong>Tobho had learned to work Valyrian steel at the
  forges of Qohor as a boy</strong>. Only a man who knew the spells could take
  old weapons and forge them anew.<br><sub>AGOT - Eddard VI</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now this only mentions that he used to work in Qohor as a boy. It doesn't really establish that he was born and raised Qohorik. Not to mention, Tobho speaks clean Common Tongue as if it was his first language, without any accent or any funny manner of speech, as we see with other foreigner characters in the series. That would make sense if he were let's say a second generation immigrant, born in Westeros who went back to Qohor to learn the arts of metalwork. </p>

<p>But the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tobho_Mott"" rel=""noreferrer"">ASOIAF Wiki</a> is fairly certain that the man is Qohorik. Quoting them:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tobho Mott is a Qohorik master armorer whose shop is at the top of the
  Street of Steel in King's Landing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there any conclusive evidence in the series or George's interviews which establishes his ethnicity?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","177499","<p>We can't be 100% sure where he is from but it seems incredibly likely that he is Qohorik. We know that Qohor is the only place to claim to know how to work Valyrian Steel.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The properties of Valyrian steel are well-known, and are the result of both folding iron many times to balance and remove impurities, and the use of spells—or at least arts we do not know—to give unnatural strength to the resulting steel. Those arts are now lost, though <strong>the smiths of Qohor claim to still know magics for reworking Valyrian steel</strong> without losing its strength or unsurpassed ability to hold an edge.<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice and Fire, Ancient History: Valyria’s Children</sub></p>

<p>We also know it was Tobho that reworked Ice into Widow's Wail and Oathkeeper and from your quote we know that he learnt that in Qohor.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You have done good work, <strong>Master Mott</strong>,"" Lord Tywin told the armorer. ""My steward will see to your payment. And remember, rubies for the scabbards.""<br>
  <sub>A Storm of Swords, Tyrion IV</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And we know he is very good at putting colour into metal, he even got some red into Valyrian steel.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Nor I, my lord,"" said the armorer. ""I confess, these colors were not what I intended, and I do not know that I could duplicate them. Your lord father had asked for the crimson of your House, and it was <strong>that color I set out to infuse into the metal. But Valyrian steel is stubborn.</strong> These old swords remember, it is said, and they do not change easily. <strong>I worked half a hundred spells and brightened the red time and time again, but always the color would darken,</strong> as if the blade was drinking the sun from it. And some folds would not take the red at all, as you can see. If my lords of Lannister are displeased, I will of course try again, as many times as you should require, but—""<br>

  <sub>A Game of Thrones, Eddard VI</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We also know that the smiths in Qohor know how to put colour into steel so the evidence suggests he definitely trained in Qohor. Seeing as he was a boy when he trained it seems likely he is at least from the Free Cities or at least Essos.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Qohorik swords, knives, and armor are superior to even the best castle-forged steel of Westeros, and <strong>the city's smiths have perfected the art of infusing deep color into the metals</strong> of their work, producing armor and weaponry of lasting beauty.<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice and Fire, The Free Cities: Qohor</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Lastly, we hear that those secrets of Qohor are tightly guarded so it seems very unlikely that they'd give them to an outsider, especially a boy. With all this together I'd say it's 99.99% certain he is Qohorik though with no explicit quote I can't say for sure.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Only here, in all the world, has the art of reworking Valyrian steel been preserved, <strong>its secrets jealously guarded.</strong><br>
  ...<br>
  Maester Pol's treatise on Qohorik metalworking, written during several years of residence in the Free City, reveals just <strong>how jealously the secrets are guarded: He was thrice publicly whipped and cast out from the city for making too many inquiries.</strong> The final time, his hand was also removed following the allegation that he stole a Valyrian steel blade. According to Pol, the true reason for his final exile was his discovery of blood sacrifices—including the killing of slaves as young as infants—which the Qohorik smiths used in their efforts to produce a steel to equal that of the Freehold.<br>

<blockquote>
  <p>Petyr ingratiated himself into Jon's services, first as a customs officer at Gulltown, <strong>where he increased the port's revenues tenfold</strong>. Seeing Littlefinger's financial acumen, Jon was easily convinced by Lysa to later bring Littlefinger to the royal court at King's Landing, and make him Master of Coin on King Robert Baratheon's Small Council.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do any of the books explain how this character accomplishes this feat? For sure Petyr Baelish is intelligent and cutthroat, but do the books explain specifically how he increased the revenue of Gulltown, the Vale's greatest port? Did he just optimize a neglected workflow? Did he use force as much as brain (""persuading"" influencing personalities, using extortion, blackmail, etc.)? Did he just use his intelligence and a good use of spies, incentives and bribes? </p>

<p>What did he do specifically when he was controller of the customs to increase the revenue by so much?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","177852","<p>The answer will have to be from the books as the show has no info in this regard as far as I know. </p>

<p>First thing first, There are varying accounts about his earlier performance. Tyrion says Littlefinger increased Gulltown's revenues threefolds and that It was the Crown's revenues which were increased tenfold. Lysa Arryn says he increased Gulltown's revenues tenfolds.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ten years ago, Jon Arryn had given him a minor sinecure in customs,
  where Lord <strong>Petyr had soon distinguished himself by bringing in three
  times as much as any of the king's other collectors</strong>. King Robert had
  been a prodigious spender. A man like Petyr Baelish, who had a gift
  for rubbing two golden dragons together to breed a third, was
  invaluable to his Hand. Littlefinger's rise had been arrow-swift.
  Within three years of his coming to court, he was master of coin and a
  member of the small council, and <strong>today the crown's revenues were ten
  times what they had been under his beleaguered predecessor</strong> . . .
  though the crown's debts had grown vast as well. A master juggler was
  Petyr Baelish.<br><sub><strong>ACOK - Tyrion VI</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My father said he was too lowborn, but I knew how high he’d rise.
  <strong>Jon gave him the customs for Gulltown to please me, but when he increased the incomes tenfold my lord husband saw how clever he was</strong>
  and gave him other appointments<br><sub><strong>ASOS - Sansa VI</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would say he used the same tricks he used when he was master of the coin, if that performance is built and perfected from his previous way of making the dragons breed.</p>

<p>He did not believe in putting gold in a vault and locking it up. He used to invest the revenues in ventures to generate more revenue. Furthermore, he was great at picking the right men for the right job, which enhanced efficiency of bureaucracy and therefore the revenues. He did not care for a man's birth as long as he was fit to do the job. And almost always, these men proved to be more qualified than their highborn counterparts.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh, he was clever. <strong>He did not simply collect the gold and lock it in
  a treasure vault, no. He paid the king's debts in promises, and put
  the king's gold to work. He bought wagons, shops, ships, houses. He
  bought grain when it was plentiful and sold bread when it was scarce.
  He bought wool from the north and linen from the south and lace from
  Lys, stored it, moved it, dyed it, sold it. The golden dragons bred
  and multiplied, and Littlefinger lent them out and brought them home
  with hatchlings.</strong></p>
  
  <p>And in the process, he moved his own men into place. The Keepers of
  the Keys were his, all four. The King's Counter and the King's Scales
  were men he'd named. The officers in charge of all three mints.
  Harbormasters, tax farmers, customs sergeants, wool factors, toll
  collectors, pursers, wine factors; nine of every ten belonged to
  Littlefinger. <strong>They were men of middling birth, by and large;
  merchants' sons, lesser lordlings, sometimes even foreigners, but
  judging from their results, far more able than their highborn
  predecessors.</strong><br><sub><strong>ACOK - Tyrion VI</strong></sub></p>

"177759","How are the Forks connected in the Trident?","<p>In the maps at the beginning of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> books there is something that tickles me: on the map of ""The North"", the Red Fork and the Blue Fork flow into each other and meet the Green Fork downstream; yet on the map of ""The South"", the Green Fork and the Blue Fork flow into each other and meet the Red Fork downstream.</p>

<p>On some unofficial maps, the Trident makes some kind of ""delta"" at the confluence of the three Forks (they look a bit like lakes) so it might be difficult to say where exactly a fork meets another, but that's not the case on the official maps I've found (<em>The Lands of Ice and Fire</em> or at the beginning of each book).</p>

<p>I know George R. R. Martin stated that the maps weren't definitive because he can't (in a way) afford to be too precise since he still have to write the story (so there will be other travel paths that aren't described yet); and because the maps are supposed to be drawn by maesters <em>in-world</em> who don't have the same tools as we do to observe the world (there might as well be unknown places where no one went, or that no one made report of). But the Trident is a well known place and many boats are sailing its forks, so there should not be too much confusion about the confluences.</p>

<p>doesn't/don't invade anytime soon.</p>

<p>In general, what does the small council/High Septon et al do in situations like these?</p>

<p>What about the wardens or other lords and ladies of Westeros? What might they do? Would this affect them?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><politics>","110749","<p>If Tommen and Margaery both die, Stannis is the next in line for the throne (assuming he's also alive). If Stannis is also dead, then the answer depends on which medium you're talking about, (in the books, it's Shireen). Who's in line <em>after</em> Shireen is entirely unknown, because we don't know enough about Robert's family, but for practical purposes, it likely wouldn't matter.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that we know his real parents, Tommen is still legally a Baratheon. His position on the throne comes from his father Robert. As far as we can tell, the Seven Kingdoms use a typical male primogeniture system where the line of succession is basically:</p>

<ul>
<li>The eldest male child of the monarch;</li>
<li>The eldest male child of the eldest male child of the monarch;</li>
<li>The eldest male child of <em>that</em> person, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you've followed the generations all the way down and run out of eldest male children, succession moves to that persons brothers, and then to that persons sisters. If there are none of those, you back up a generation and repeat the process.</p>

<p>So, Robert had two sons and a daughter. The line of succession was Joffrey, then Tommen, then Myrcella. (If Joffrey had given birth to a son, that boy would have been inserted before Tommen). If all three of those children are dead, you move up a generation, back to Robert, and go to the eldest brother.</p>

<p>This is exactly the reason that Eddard Stark claimed Stannis as the legitimate heir in the first place: if none of Robert's children are true-born, they don't count, and Stannis is next in line. If all of Robert's children are dead, then their legitimacy is irrelevant, and Stannis inherits anyway.</p>

<p>If Stannis is also dead, we repeat that process, starting from him as King; his only child is Shireen, who would become Queen. </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Note that she's dead in the show but <em>probably</em> going to die in the books.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After that, things get very complicated. We would need to follow the family tree up to Robert's parents, who are obviously dead, and look for any uncles Robert might have had and track <em>their</em> children down. As far as I know, Robert's father and grandfather were both only children meaning it's going to take a lot of family-tree searching to find a legitimate heir. But at this point, if the line of succession gets this muddled, for all <em>practical</em> purposes it's basically ended. </p>

<p>People who are already close to the throne (particularly Cersei and Margaery's families) would probably begin to press claims for inheritance on their own. <em>Normally</em> a woman can't ""marry into"" the line of succession, Cersei can't be Queen on her own, but her daughter can, but when things get this murky, the rules tend to take a back seat to the people with the biggest armies.</p>

<p>In addition, this is the point where known bastard children would come into play. People like Edric, who is not in line for the throne legally but <em>is</em> Robert's child, become a huge political rallying point when the throne becomes heavily contested. They can make the argument that they're <em>closer</em> to the throne than anyone actually in the line of succession, and a lot of people would back them up.</p>

<p>So, <em>if</em> it happens that Tommen dies without producing an heir, the most likely outcome is various powerful houses (the Lannisters, Tyrells and the Baratheon's sworn houses w/ Edric Storm) going to war, again, until one of them has enough military and political support to simply declare themselves King and everyone will accept it and move on.</p>

<p>I've seen various posts talking about why the Targaryens don't have purple eyes in the show and they all boil down to the following points:</p>

<ul>
<li>They looked fake</li>
<li>Contact lenses were uncomfortable for the actors</li>
<li>CGI for them was too expensive for little gain</li>
<li>Contact lenses obscure ""eye acting""</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>[BENIOFF] I also remember even <strong>at one point we were trying out purple contacts for Daenerys</strong> and [Tyrion] was supposed to have one green eye and one brown eye. The reality of it is that a character who’s in the show as much as Peter is in the show, to be <strong>wearing colored contact lenses every day you shoot is a nightmare.</strong> But sticking to the letter of the books was important enough that that was all on the table. I think by the time Emilia [Clarke] came along we were off that idea. <strong>But in the initial pilot we see what acting with purple contacts can do to somebody and how much time they spend focusing on the fact that their eyes don’t feel right.</strong></p>

<p>However, there are several reasons as to why the Wall won't have nets:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's 700 ft high to successfully stop a suicide it would need more than one row of nets and each would be further out than the last</li>
<li>Suicide = desertion and desertion is punishable by death (though the watch is undermanned now so there's some leniency e.g. Jon)</li>
<li>The Wall is 300 miles long so that's a lot of nets to keep and maintain</li>
<li>The watch is severely undermanned and can't even maintain the trees growing near the Wall or all their castles, the nets are secondary compared to this</li>
<li>Don't want to protect the wildling climbers</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also some reasons as to why it would have them:</p>

<ul>
<li>Someone falling off accidentally or regretting the jump but unable to stop it</li>
<li>Someone being pushed off</li>
<li>They're short on men so someone saved is better than lost</li>

<p><strong>1. Put aside House name</strong></p>

<p><strong>2. Serve the realm</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""He told me that a maester's collar is made of chain to remind him that he is sworn to serve,"" Jon said, remembering. ""I asked why each link was a different metal. A silver chain would look much finer with his grey robes, I said. Maester Luwin laughed. A maester forges his chain with study, he told me. The different metals are each a different kind of learning, gold for the study of money and accounts, silver for healing, iron for warcraft. And he said there were other meanings as well. <strong>The collar is supposed to remind a maester of the realm he serves, isn't that so?</strong> Lords are gold and knights steel, but two links can't make a chain. You also need silver and iron and lead, tin and copper and bronze and all the rest, and those are farmers and smiths and merchants and the like. <strong>A chain needs all sorts of metals, and a land needs all sorts of people.</strong>""<br>
  <sub>A Game of Thrones, Jon V</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>3. Hold no lands or lordships</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Grand Maester Pycelle did not disappoint her. ""Lord Qyburn?"" he managed, purpling. ""Your Grace, this . . . <strong>a maester swears sacred vows, to hold no lands or lordships</strong> . . .""<br>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>4. Father no children</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a maester donned his collar, he put aside the hope of children, yet Cressen had oft felt a father nonetheless. Robert, Stannis, Renly . . . three sons he had raised after the angry sea claimed Lord Steffon. Had he done so ill that now he must watch one kill the other? He could not allow it, would not allow it.<br>
  <sub>A Clash of Kings, Prologue</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also just like the Night's Watch Acolytes and Novices can leave the order before they become a Maester.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That was many years ago, to be sure. The boy of sixteen was a man past forty now, and his legend had grown a deal darker. He had traveled in the Free Cities, learning the poisoner's trade and perhaps arts darker still, if rumors could be believed. <strong>He had studied at the Citadel, going so far as to forge six links of a maester's chain before he grew bored.</strong> He had soldiered in the Disputed Lands across the narrow sea, riding with the Second Sons for a time before forming his own company. His tourneys, his battles, his duels, his horses, his carnality . . . it was said that he bedded men and women both, and had begotten bastard girls all over Dorne. The sand snakes, men called his daughters. So far as Tyrion had heard, Prince Oberyn had never fathered a son.<br>

</blockquote>

<p>Note though that the Citadel has been known to kick a maester out of the order but this still wouldn't conflict with the Night's Watch oath.</p>

"45251","Game of Thrones: Alternate reading order for Books 4 and 5?","<p>I'm still working my way through the third book, but as I understand it, books four and five (<em>A Feast for Crows</em> and <em>A Dance with Dragons</em>) occur at the same time -- both picking up immediately after <em>A Storm of Swords</em> ends -- but taking place in different locations.</p>

<p>I've read that the original publication of a <em>A Feast for Crows</em> was met with some disappointment, with some fans being unhappy having to plough through a whole book before finding out what happened to their favorite characters after <em>A Storm of Swords</em>.</p>

<p>With this in mind, I was wondering if a different reading order might be permissible? For example, could someone chose to read <em>A Dance with Dragons</em> first? Or, even more audaciously, would it be possible to read both books simultaneously? I.e. A chapter from one book, followed by a chapter from the other? </p>

<p>Are either of these viable reading orders, or are there important reasons why <em>A Feast for Crows</em> should be read first?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><suggested-order>","45261","<p>You can certainly read the chapters chronologically, instead of first reading through all of <i>A Feast For Crows</i>. Sean Collins put together a very nice reading order over here: <a href=""http://boiledleather.com/post/25902554148/a-new-reader-friendly-combined-reading-order-for-a"">A proposed A Feast for Crows/A Dance with Dragons merged reading order, with explanation</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""http://towerofthehand.com/essays/reread/afwd.html"">The Tower of the Hand</a> is doing a re-read of the books right now using this proposed reading order. So far the order has not felt forced at all, and feels very natural. However, I could see it being a pain to sit down and do this yourself, as you have to put your book down at the end of each chapter, consult the list, find the next chapter, etc.</p>

<p>Anyway, Sean's order is listed below by book and chapter number. I removed the character names to prevent accidentally revealing any spoilers:</p>

"179271","How did Gendry start to work for Tobho Mott?","<p>While investigating Jon Arryn's death, Eddard Stark comes to learn that Jon and Stannis regularly visited Tobho Mott's weaponsmith to check up on a young boy, Gendry, Robert Baratheon's bastard son.</p>

<p>It is not clear to me how Gendry ended up working there, especially how his identity was initially discovered and why someone (still unidentified?) paid a high price for his internship at the smith.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><character-development>","179272","<p>Gendry came to work for Tobho Mott when an unnamed Lord paid him to take him on as an apprentice. This lord would have known who Gendry was too as he paid double with the second fee being for Tobho to keep his mouth shut.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ned touched the boy's head, fingering the thick black hair. ""Look at me, Gendry."" The apprentice lifted his face. Ned studied the shape of his jaw, the eyes like blue ice. Yes, he thought, I see it. ""Go back to your work, lad. I'm sorry to have bothered you."" He walked back to the house with the master. ""Who paid the boy's apprentice fee?"" he asked lightly.<br>
  Mott looked fretful. ""You saw the boy. Such a strong boy. Those hands of his, those hands were made for hammers. He had such promise, I took him on without a fee.""<br>
  ""The truth now,"" Ned urged. ""The streets are full of strong boys. The day you take on an apprentice without a fee will be the day the Wall comes down. Who paid for him?""<br>
  ""<strong>A lord</strong>,"" the master said reluctantly. ""He gave no name, and wore no sigil on his coat. He paid in gold, <strong>twice the customary sum, and said he was paying once for the boy, and once for my silence.</strong>""<br>
  ""Describe him.""<br>
  ""He was stout, round of shoulder, not so tall as you. Brown beard, but there was a bit of red in it, I'll swear. He wore a rich cloak, that I do remember, heavy purple velvet worked with silver threads, but the hood shadowed his face and I never did see him clear."" He hesitated a moment. ""My lord, I want no trouble.""<br>

</blockquote>

<p>As for who the lord was that paid the fee well we don't know. I believe though that the leading theory is that it was Varys in a disguise. He clearly knows about them as he remarks to Tyrion.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Robert's bastards? What of them?""<br>
  ""<strong>He fathered eight, to the best of my knowing</strong>,"" Varys said as he wrestled with the saddle. ""Their mothers were copper and honey, chestnut and butter, yet the babes were all black as ravens . . . and as ill-omened, it would seem. So when Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen slid out between your sister's thighs, each as golden as the sun, the truth was not hard to glimpse.""<br>
  <sub>A Clash of Kings, Tyrion III</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We know he likes to use disguises too as is evident when again he tells Tyrion.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The work I do does not permit me to travel the streets amid a column of knights. So when I leave the castle, I adopt more suitable guises, and thus live to serve you longer.""<br>

"179340","Why was Robb Stark married under the Light of the Seven?","<p>Throughout the HBO show we see a variety of weddings and wedding ceremonies. My question concerns Robb Stark's wedding to Talisa Maegyr. In the show we see that they are secretly married and say the vows of the Faith of the Seven. Shouldn't Robb have been married under the sight of the Old Gods as they are the Gods of his father? </p>

<p>Maybe there were no Weirwoods nearby to perform the ceremony. Maybe simply being in the south is enough to mandate a wedding by septon. Maybe the Faith of Seven is a quick ceremony so Robb and Talisa can get it on sooner. Maybe there is some actual reason?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","179341","<p>It appears as though Game of Thrones writer Bryan Cogman has already answered this one for us. Essentially they wanted to get married then and there and getting married in the light of the Seven was their best bet. He also alludes to Cat having been of the Seven and so that would play a part in it too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Justin:</strong> <em>Why were Robb and Talisa married in the light of the Seven rather than in front of a Heart Tree?</em></p>
<p><strong>Bryan:</strong> Shotgun wedding! Of sorts. They wanted to get married and there was a septon readily available. At any rate, Robb was raised in an interfaith household — he could very well have spent as much time with with Septon Chayle growing up as he did in the godswood. So I don’t see a problem with him having a Seven wedding. But I guess a lot of people do cuz I get asked that question all the time.</p>
<p>Now the line about Karstark praying to the Father in 208… yeah, I should’ve caught that. Karstark would be strictly Old Gods, I think. If it helps, you could read it as “I’d even break my faith and pray to the bloody FATHER if that’s what it took to bring my sons back”… but I’m not sure that was the intent. But maybe it was. I try my best!</p>

"179375","Who built the main roads in Westeros?","<p>Do we know exactly by whom and when, where the main roads built?<br>
By main roads, I mean named roads, that show on maps such as Kingsroad, Roseroad, Ocean road...<br>
I know the Kingsroad was built by King Jaehaerys, and Roseroad is also probably Targaryen era, as it connects King's Landing, and the ""Rose"" refers to Tyrell instead of ""Garden road"", and that as Kings Landing is new, the road connecting Kings Landing is also probably new, but what about the others?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","179378","<h1>The major roads departing King's Landing were all built by Jaehaerys</h1>
<h3>Kingsroad, Roseroad, Goldroad, Causeway, River road and Rosby Road.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the Conciliator began the construction of the great network of roads that would one day join King’s Landing to the Reach, the stormlands, the westerlands, the riverlands, and even the North—understanding that to knit together the realm it must be easier to travel among its regions. The kingsroad was the greatest of these roads, reaching hundreds of leagues to Castle Black and the Wall.<br />

<p>This most likely includes, the Kingsroad, the Roseroad, the Goldroad, the Causeway, the River road and the Rosby road.</p>
<h3>The high road</h3>
<p>The high road from the Riverlands to the vale has existed for centuries and may have been built at a similar time as the Bloody Gate, in the reign of King Osric V, it may however have been built earlier by the First Men, as they had built an unmortared wall there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The high road from the riverlands through the Mountains of the Moon has seen much blood spilled, for steep and stony as it is, it provides the most likely way for an army to enter the Vale. Its eastern end is guarded by the Bloody Gate, once merely a rough-hewn, <strong>unmortared wall after the fashion of the ringforts of the First Men</strong>. But in the reign of <strong>King Osric V Arryn, this fortress was constructed anew.</strong> Over the centuries, a dozen invading armies have smashed themselves to pieces attempting to breach the Bloody Gates.<br />

<h3>Ocean road</h3>
<p>We do know, at the time of Aegon I conquering Westeros, the Ocean road has already been built:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the west, King Mern of the Reach rode the Ocean Road north to Casterly Rock to meet with King Loren of House Lannister.<br />
<sub>ibid. - The Reign of the Dragons: The Conquest</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Prince's Pass</h3>
<p>Similarly, the Prince's Pass had existed at the time of Aegon's Conquer</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A host of Dornish spearmen guarded the Prince’s Pass, the gateway through the Red Mountains, but Rhaenys did not engage them.<br />
<sub>ibid.</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was however known as the Wide way, before being renamed the Prince's Pass</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a boy, he turned back the Dornish when King Ferris Fowler led ten thousand men through the Wide Way (as the Prince’s Pass was then called), intent on conquest.<br />

<h3>Boneway</h3>
<p>The Boneway had also clearly existed long before the coming of the Targaryens and featured in the Rhoynar invasion of Dorne.</p>

"179529","What is the meaning of House Targaryen's sigil?","<p>House Targaryen is one of the greatest houses of the Westeros which ruled the seven kingdoms for nearly three centuries. The house is associated with the dragons. Their Sigil is a three headed dragon on a black background. </p>

<p>What is the meaning of this Sigil? What does the red three headed Dragon on a black field mean? Is there any significance?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","179531","<h3>The Three Headed Dragon</h3>
<p>It is a three headed dragon which stand for the three conquering dragons which were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Aegon the Conqueror</li>
<li>Visenya Targaryen (Who should be the one called the Conqueror instead of her brother)</li>
<li>Rhaenys Targaryen</li>
</ol>
<p>Since they are born of the same parents, they are one, but three. So therefore, a single dragon with three heads.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The dragon has three heads,” she sighed. “Do you know what that
means, Jorah?”</p>
<p>“Your Grace? The sigil of House Targaryen is a three-headed dragon,
red on black.”</p>
<p>“I know that. But there are no three-headed dragons.”</p>
<p><strong>“The three heads were Aegon and his sisters.”</strong></p>
<p>“Visenya and Rhaenys,” she recalled. “I am descended from Aegon and
Rhaenys through their son Aenys and their grandson Jaehaerys.”<br><sub><em><strong>ACOK- Daenerys V</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But of course we can say that Jorah may have been mistaken about it but there is nothing to indicate that he was.</p>
<p>In any case, there you have it. Three Conquerors, one realm. Three Royals, one Kingdom. Three persons, one family.</p>
<h3>Why choose that device?</h3>
<p>They chose it when they started conquering Westeros just to show their new subjects that they were adopting Westerosi customs and culture. The Targaryens did not have that sigil or any sigil at all prior to the conquest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Heraldic banners</strong> had long been a tradition amongst the lords of Westeros, but such <strong>had never been used by the dragonlords of old
Valyria</strong>. When Aegon’s knights unfurled his great silken battle
standard, with a red three-headed dragon breathing fire upon a black
field, the lords took it for a sign that he was now truly one of them,
a worthy high king for Westeros.<br><sub><em><strong>TWOIAF- The Reign of the Dragons:
The Conquest</strong></em></sub></p>

<p>Since Draconic symbols were associated with Valyria, a Dragon seems like a good choice for a heraldic device.</p>

<p>They did have words prior to that (Fire and Blood), which can be assumed to be, because Princess Meria Martell knew those words when Rhaenys threatened her with them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I will not fight you,&quot; Princess Meria told Rhaenys, &quot;nor will I kneel
to you. Dorne has no king. Tell your brother that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I shall,&quot; Rhaenys replied, &quot;but we will come again, Princess, and the
next time <strong>we shall come with fire and blood.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Your words</strong>,&quot; said Princess Meria. &quot;Ours are Unbowed, Unbent,
Unbroken. You may burn us, my lady...but you will not bend us, break
us, or make us bow. This is Dorne. You are not wanted here. Return at
your peril.&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>TWOIAF- The Reign of the Dragons:
The Conquest</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Must be noted, however, that in ASOS Daenerys mistakenly thought that &quot;Blood and Fire&quot; were the Targaryen words.</p>
<h3>The Colors</h3>
<p>The choice of the colors, Red and Black, may have been due to their Valyrian background. Everything the Valyrians accomplished was due to the fire of their dragons and blood magic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What feeds a dragon's fire? All Valyrian sorcery was rooted in blood
or fire.<br><sub><em><strong>AFFC- Samwell V</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since red is associated with fire/blood and black is the color of soot (And also the fire of Balerion), that choice seems apt. However we must note this is my own speculation, GRRM is silent on the matter.</p>
<h3>Does it have anything to do with Rhaegar's prophecy?</h3>
<p>Presumably not. We still do not know if Rhaegar had full access to the prophecy or understood it properly. He was mistaken about it twice. First he thought he was the Prince that was promised. Then he thought it was his son Aegon. He was wrong the both times. Besides, as Tyrion says, a Prophecy is like a half trained mule, once you start trusting it, it will kick you in the head.</p>
<p>It is very unlikely that Aegon, Visenya and Rhaenys, who just improvised with a sigil out of political needs, read extensively on prophecies and made their sigil according to one, which did not necessarily talk about Valyrians or the Targaryens. Unlike the three conquerors, Rhaegar was so obsessed with books that people used to joke that the Queen must have swallowed some books and candles when she was pregnant with him. The same was never said about the three conquerors.</p>

However, what strikes me as odd is that it seems that <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/5896/65294"">House Stark generally still sees joining the Night's Watch as honorable</a> despite this.</p>

<p>The Starks and other Northern houses are educated and probably know <em>more</em> about the realities of life as a member than other families of Westeros do due to actually having a border with the Watch's lands: They've actually <em>seen</em> all that stuff rather than just hearing about it... so they are most definitely aware that it's a dumping ground for the dregs of society and not some noble cause <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Night&#39;s_Watch#History"" rel=""noreferrer"">like it may be portrayed as in legends</a>. So, then, <strong>why do the Starks and other Northerners still consider joining the Night's Watch  to be an honorable act while it seems that no one else in Westeros does?</strong> Is it just because members of the Stark house invested a lot in it throughout history (e.g. <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Brandon_Stark_(Builder)"" rel=""noreferrer"">Bran the Builder</a>) and they're reluctant to ""give up"" on it as a sort of psychological sunk-cost fallacy?</p>

<p>There is a long history to the Night's Watch, and the North remembers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks to the children, <strong>the first men of the Night's Watch banded together and were able to fight—and win—the Battle for the Dawn</strong>: the last battle that broke the endless winter and sent the Others fleeing to the icy north. Now, six thousand years later (or eight thousand as True History puts forward), the Wall made to defend the realms of men is still manned by the sworn brothers of the Night's Watch, and neither the Others nor the children have been seen in many centuries.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p>That [the Others] became monstrous in the tales told thereafter, according to Fomas, reflects the desire of <strong>the Night's Watch and the Starks to give themselves a more heroic identity as saviors of mankind</strong>, and not merely the beneficiaries of a struggle over dominion.<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice and Fire - Ancient History: The Long Night</sub></p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p>The history of the Night's Watch is a long one. Tales still tell of the black knights of the Wall and their noble calling. But the Age of Heroes is long done, and the Others have not shown themselves in thousands of years, if indeed they ever existed.<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice and Fire - The Wall and Beyond: The Night’s Watch</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Starks and the North remember the history upon which the Night's Watch was born. A brotherhood sworn to protect <em>everyone</em>, regardless of allegiances from the forgotten terror that lies in the forgotten North.</p>

<p>The allegiance of the Night's Watch to the realm is noted on by Visenya, when she models the Kingsguard vows after those of the Night's Watch. However instead of the realm, the Kingsguard are sworn to the King.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She modeled their vows upon those of the Night's Watch, so that they would forfeit all things save their duty to the king.<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice and Fire - The Targaryen Kings: Aegon I</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was the North that was directly in line to get <em>rekt</em> by the Others, and the Nights Watch were the ones protecting them:</p>

  <p>The northern boundary of the Stark domains was protected by the Wall and the men of the Night's Watch<br>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's also a recognition that the wall has helped protect the North from wildling invasions much more recently than when the Others were last seen. It's an honorable (sic) calling for a younger son, who otherwise has few prospects, to take the black because of this history

<p>It is for the most part unclear why they honour it so, but just that they do.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wildling raids may rightly be considered more of a nuisance than a menace; many wise men suggest that they might be better dealt with by allowing the lords of the North to extend their rule beyond the Wall so that they can drive the wildlings back.<br>
  Only the fact that the Northmen themselves greatly honor the Watch has kept it functioning, and a great part of the food that keeps the black brothers of Castle Black, the Shadow Tower, and Eastwatch-by-the-Sea from starving comes not from the Gift but from the yearly gifts these Northern lords deliver to the Wall in token of their support.<br>

<p>The extent to which it was deemed honourable in the days of old is remarked on by Jon, when discussing the Shieldhall. Where the old Shields of knights and nobleman who'd given up their Houses for the black would hang their shields, until their death,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Shieldhall was one of the older parts of Castle Black, a long drafty feast hall of dark stone, its oaken rafters black with the smoke of centuries. <strong>Back when the Night's Watch had been much larger, its walls had been hung with rows of brightly colored wooden shields.</strong> Then as now, when a knight took the black, tradition decreed that he <strong>set aside his former arms and take up the plain black shield of the brotherhood.</strong> The shields thus discarded would hang in the Shieldhall.<br>
  Hundreds of knights meant hundreds of shields. Hawks and eagles, dragons and griffins, suns and stags, wolves and wyverns, manticores, ... , and a hundred other heraldic charges had adorned the Shieldhall walls, blazoned in more colors than any rainbow ever dreamed of.<br>
  But <strong>when a knight died, his shield was taken down, that it might go with him to his pyre or his tomb</strong>...<br>
  <sub>A Dance with Dragons: Jon XIII</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<hr> 

<p>The Southerners have long forgotten the threats of not only the Others, but of the Wildlings, they mostly consider it to be folk stories and old wives' tales. The Southron lords have only known the Northern realm to be their threat from the North (before Aegon's Landing) since the Night's Watch and the North had kept everything else at bay. This ignorance was, however, not always the case, as the description of the Shieldhall states, there were scores of houses once represented on the walls of the Hall.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hawks and eagles, dragons and griffins, suns and stags, wolves and wyverns, manticores, bulls, trees and flowers, harps, spears, crabs and krakens, red lions and golden lions and chequy lions, owls, lambs, maids and mermen, stallions, stars, buckets and buckles, flayed men and hanged men and burning men, axes, longswords, turtles, unicorns, bears, quills, spiders and snakes and scorpions<br>

"112301","In Game of Thrones, how difficult would it be to invade the Vale of Arryn through The Bite?","<p>My idea of the Vale, and the reason why it's considered impregnable without dragons (or maybe boats), is because of the bottleneck in the Bloody Gate; however, looking at a map of the area, it seems that it would be easy to bypass that bottleneck by entering the Vale through The Bite. It would be a longer walk to The Eyrie, but considering it wouldn't be that much longer, it looks like an obvious choice for an attack.</p>

<p>I'm assuming there's more to this than what I know from watching the show and looking at a map, so my question is: are there plausible reasons that would make The Bite a less preferable entry point than it looks at face value?</p>

<p>King <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Harmund_II_Hoare"" rel=""noreferrer"">Harmund II Hoare</a> created that heresy and adopted it. He was born an Ironman but was raised at Casterly Rock by the Lannister Kings so he observed the Andal religion very closely and when he came back to rule Iron Islands after his father died, the Andals had left a deep impression on him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His son Harmund the Haggler shared his love of reading, and became
renowned as a great traveler. He was the first king of the Iron
Islands to visit the green lands without a sword in his hand. Having
<strong>spent his youth as a ward of House Lannister</strong>, the second Harmund
returned to Casterly Rock as a king and took the Lady Lelia Lannister,
a daughter of the King of the Rock and &quot;the fairest flower of the
west,&quot; for his queen. On a later voyage he visited Highgarden and
Oldtown, to treat with their lords and kings and foster trade.<br><sub><em><strong>TWOIAF: The Iron Islands -  The Black Blood</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He formed a blend of both faiths and spoke of Eight Gods which were the seven Gods of the Andal faith plus the Drowned god of the Ironborn. According to him, There were eight Gods and each sept should have a statue of Drowned God as well. This offended both the Ironborn Priests and Septons alike. Seeing the things getting intense, the King later rescinded that proclamation but insisted that Like the Seven were different aspects of the same one God, Drowned God was one aspect of the Andal deity, the Stranger.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though Harmund II accepted the Seven as true gods, <strong>he continued to
do honor to the Drowned God as well, and on his return to Great Wyk
spoke openly of &quot;the Eight Gods,&quot;</strong> and decreed that <strong>a statue of the
Drowned God should be raised at the doors of every sept</strong>. This
pleased neither the septons nor the priests and was denounced by both.
In an attempt to placate them, the king rescinded his decree and
declared that god had but seven faces...but the Drowned God was one of
those, as an aspect of the Stranger.<br><sub><em><strong>TWOIAF: The Iron Islands -  The Black Blood</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Needless to say, his views were not popular and in the reign of his son, Harmund III, all hell broke lose. The Ironborn clergy deposed the King in a popular rebellion and mutilated him in inhuman fashion. This hybrid of the two faiths ended right there and then.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He was considering a measure to end the practice of thralldom on the
isles as well when a <strong>priest known as the Shrike began to preach</strong>
<strong>against him.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Other priests took up the cry</strong>, and the lords of the isles took heed. Only the septons and their followers stood by King Harmund, and
he was overthrown within a fortnight, almost bloodlessly. What
followed was far from bloodless, however. <strong>The Shrike himself tore
out the deposed king's tongue, so he might never again speak &quot;lies and
blasphemies.&quot;</strong> Harmund was blinded as well, and his nose was cut off,
so &quot;all men might see him for the monster he is.&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>TWOIAF: The Iron Islands -  The Black Blood</strong></em></sub></p>

<h3>The Faith of The Moonsingers</h3>
<p>This faith was founded by escaped Slaves of Valyria. They essentially combined the aspects of all the religions observed by the former Slaves who had escaped to Braavos. Quoting GRRM:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>Could you give us any information concerning the moonsingers that were key to the founding of Braavos?</strong></p>
<p>As you know, they were slaves who fled from Valyria and they found a
place as far away from Valyria that they could get. What basically
happened was that a Valyrian fleet, which was rowed by slaves, was
taken over by the slaves after they mutined. And they decided to get
as far away to the north as they could, sailing through the narrow sea
to find a refuge. The founded Braavos and kept the city secret for
about a hundred years. For those first hundred years, practically no
one knew of the city's existence. Because the city is founded by
slaves, it's not a homogenous population, <strong>there were slaves from all
sorts of different places with different ethnicities, different
homelands, different customs, different religions. So they create a
new religion, one with one god that can be applied to all the other
fatihs and is tolerant of all the other faiths.</strong><br><sub><em><strong><a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Asshai.com_Interview_in_Barcelona"" rel=""noreferrer"">So Spake Martin: Asshai.com Interview in Barcelona</a></strong></em></sub></p>

<h3>Why are different sects not found in Planetosi religions</h3>
<p>This part is primarily my own speculation so you may choose to skip this.</p>
<p>The People of Planetos, like people of Medieval world, are very sensitive about the faiths. We see religious wars between Andal and First Men, Civil war fought between the clergy and crown when the crown tried to make an exception for the Royals in the matter of incest, Revolution against Ironborn King who was seen as going against the teachings of his faith.</p>
<p>A new faith cannot really survive and propagate without sufficient Political support. And Political leaders often tend to use the Clerics to their own ends. If common people do end up making a sect somehow, it would have been wiped out by Zealots.</p>
<p>But still it is interesting that we do not see the sects in Planetos really. Take Westeros for example:</p>
<ol>
<li>It has multiple cultures</li>
<li>A vast landmass</li>
<li>Communication difficulties i.e. traveling taking too long.</li>
<li>General populace more or less ignorant about mysteries of their faiths e.g. Commoners thinking that there are really Seven gods in the Faith of Seven when in fact there is only one who has seven aspects.</li>
<li>There is general discontent about corruption rampant in the Faith</li>
</ol>
<p>This is ripe ground for emergence of new sects in the remote and isolated communities. But yet we do not see any such developments. We can assume that's probably because the grip of clergy is tighter than we believe it is. And of course, before Jaehaerys I, the Faith had her own swords to sort out Heretics anywhere at will.</p>
<p>But a more logical reason appears to be the Author's choice. He prefers to write more about secular stuff instead of religious one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q: How important is religion and myth in your stories?</strong></p>
<p>GRRM: Mythos is important and it can also be very difficult. An
author’s beliefs color the character, audience’s beliefs color it.
<strong>Easier for me to write a secular character or someone who mocks and insults the gods than it is to write a sincerely devout character.</strong>
It’s a secular society, especially our sf/fantasy readers.<br><sub><em><strong><a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Odyssey_Con_2008_Madison_WI_April_4_6_20081"" rel=""noreferrer"">So Spake Martin: Odyssey Con 2008 (Madison, WI; April 4-6 2008)

<p>The Northern cavalry appears to be the closest we have to what Knights are in the North. They appear to serve as the same function as Knights do in the Southern armies but just don't carry the title.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""How many knights?""</p>
  
  <p>""Few enough,"" the maester said with a touch of impatience. ""To be a knight, you must stand your vigil in a sept, and be anointed with the seven oils to consecrate your vows. In the north, only a few of the great houses worship the Seven. The rest honor the old gods, and name no knights … but those lords and their sons and sworn swords are no less fierce or loyal or honorable. A man's worth is not marked by a ser before his name. As I have told you a hundred times before.""</p>

<li>Don't create a House/Sigil</li>
<li>Don't have the same social status as actual Knights</li>

<p>It's known that he was knighted by Wyman Manderly after saving his life at the Battle of the Trident and was also given Wolf's Den with the title. <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Manderly"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">House Manderly</a> keeps to the Seven and not the Old Gods despite being a Northern House and so that is why the Wyman did the knighting.</p>

<p>As for why Ser Bartimus could become a knight or did become a knight is unclear as he keeps to the Old Gods. Do we know how/why he is a knight?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","179719","<p>Having found no information online I asked Elio and Linda on twitter and they've come back saying it's a case where the knight and the ""knighter"" probably weren't that bothered about having to follow the Seven.</p>

  <p><strong>@CarrotLethal</strong>: <em>Hello! How is Ser Bartimus a knight if he keeps to the Old Gods? I know the Manderly's keep to the Seven but isn't it the knight that needs to keep to the Seven? Thanks.</em><br>
  <strong>@westerosorg</strong>: Good question. He seems to be an example of someone who was offered knighthood as a reward for his services, was willing to say the words for the value that the honorific gave, but was not really a believer at all. Whoever knighted him did not seem overly picky on the matter.<br>
  <strong>@CarrotLethal</strong>: <em>So it would appear that in modern day Westeros being a believer in the Seven isn't really necessary to become a knight? Either that or this is an edge case?</em><br>
  <strong>@westerosorg</strong>: More an anomaly rather than normal. But given that we know from ""The Sworn Sword"" of unscrupulous knights who'll knight other men who bribe them, it seems like there may be reason to think that there's certainly room for non-Seven following knights here and there.<br>

<p>This can be seen as we see two forms of the oath the formal version which is more religious.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Laughing Storm gave an impatient shake of the head. ""Go to him, Ser Duncan. I'll give squire Raymun his knighthood."" He slid his sword out of his sheath and shouldered Dunk aside. ""Raymun of House Fossoway,"" he began solemnly, touching the blade to the squire's right shoulder, ""in the name of the Warrior I charge you to be brave."" The sword moved from his right shoulder to his left. ""In the name of the Father I charge you to be just."" Back to the right. ""In the name of the Mother I charge you to defend the young and innocent."" The left. ""In the name of the Maid I charge you to protect all women.""<br>
  <sub>The Hedge Knight</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then we have a less formal version which doesn't really seem to touch on religion at all.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This time the lightning lord did not set the blade afire, but merely laid it light on Gendry's shoulder. ""Gendry, do you swear before the eyes of gods and men to defend those who cannot defend themselves, to protect all women and children, to obey your captains, your liege lord, and your king, to fight bravely when needed and do such other tasks as are laid upon you, however hard or humble or dangerous they may be?""<br>

<p>So it's clear some knights and lords are less restrictive about knights having to be followers of the Seven. We also have the case of some more knights in the North but it's unclear if the follow the Old or new Gods personally.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ser Jorah Mormont: Although House Mormont keeps to the Old Gods it's unclear whether Jorah does personally.</li>

<p><strong>Long answer</strong>: </p>

<p>There are some diferences between westerosi and european heraldry, as there are lot of rules in real world that are not followed in westeros: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>No particular jargon: In our world, there is a particular jargon to describe coats of arms, for colors and figures. For example, we don't say ""a golden lion on red background"" but ""gules, a lion or"". Westerosi seems to lack this specific kinds of terms</p></li>
<li><p>Rule of tincture: One basic rule of heraldry is the rule of tincture: metal should not be put on metal, nor colour on colour. Metal refers to gold and silver, while colors are azure(blue), gules(red), sable(black), vert(green) and purpure(purple).

"179894","Which ancestral weapon is the oldest in The World of Ice and Fire (Planetos)?","<p>Some House's proudly bear their ancestral weapon, usually a Valyrian steel made sword even if there are exceptions such as Dawn. </p>

<p>Which one of these ancestral weapons is claimed to be the oldest?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><weapon>","179895","<p>Since your question is about all ancestral swords, not just the Valyrian steel ones, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dawn"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dawn</a> is oldest ancestral sword in Westeros. It is claimed to have been passed down to the greatest Swordsmen of the House for ten thousand years.</p>

<p>Ser Gerold says this about his house:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There was an Arthur Dayne,” Myrcella said. “He was a knight of the
  Kingsguard in the days of Mad King Aerys.”</p>
  
  <p>“He was the Sword of the Morning. He is dead.”</p>
  
  <p>“Are you the Sword of the Morning now?”</p>
  
  <p>“No. Men call me Darkstar, and I am of the night.”</p>
  
  <p>Arianne drew the child away. “You must be hungry. We have dates and
  cheese and olives, and lemonsweet to drink. You ought not eat or drink
  too much, though. After a little rest, we must ride. Out here on the
  sands it is always best to travel by night, before the sun ascends the
  sky. It is kinder to the horses.”</p>
  
  <p>“And the riders,” Spotted Sylva said. “Come, Your Grace, warm
  yourself. I should be honored if you’d let me serve you.”</p>
  
  <p>As she led the princess to the fire, Arianne found Ser Gerold behind
  her. “<strong>My House goes back ten thousand years, unto the dawn of days</strong>,”
  he complained. “Why is it that my cousin is the only Dayne that anyone
  remembers?”<br><sub><strong>AFFC -  The Queen Maker</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The founder of House Dayne, according to the legend, tracked a star to the mouth of Torentine river and constructed a castle, Starfall, where the fallen star was discovered. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the mouth of the Torrentine, House Dayne raised its castle on an
  island where that roaring, tumultuous river broadens to meet the sea.
  <strong>Legend says the first Dayne was led to the site when he followed the track of a falling star and there found a stone of magical powers.</strong>
  His descendants ruled over the western mountains for centuries
  thereafter as Kings of the Torrentine and Lords of Starfall.<br><sub><strong>TWOIAF: Dorne- Kingdoms of the First Men</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sword was forged most likely from <em>the heart</em> of this star. So by that assumption, if the founder of House Dayne forged the sword and the House has been around for 10,000 years, the sword is just as old.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Something his father had told him once when he was little came back to
  him suddenly. He had asked Lord Eddard if the Kingsguard were truly
  the finest knights in the Seven Kingdoms. “No longer,” he answered,
  “but once they were a marvel, a shining lesson to the world.”</p>
  
  <p>“Was there one who was best of all?”</p>
  
  <p>“<strong>The finest knight I ever saw was Ser Arthur Dayne, who fought with
  a blade called Dawn, forged from the heart of a fallen star.</strong> They
  called him the Sword of the Morning, and he would have killed me but
  for Howland Reed.” Father had gotten sad then, and he would say no
  more. Bran wished he had asked him what he meant.<br><sub><strong>ACOK- Bran III</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In any case, TWOIAF confirms that it is likely that the sword has been in the family for several thousand years. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Daynes of Starfall are one of the most ancient houses in the Seven
  Kingdoms, though their fame largely rests on their ancestral sword,
  called Dawn, and the men who wielded it. <strong>Its origins are lost to
  legend, but it seems likely that the Daynes have carried it for
  thousands of years.</strong> Those who have had the honor of examining it say
  it looks like no Valyrian steel they know, being pale as milkglass but
  in all other respects it seems to share the properties of Valyrian
  blades, being incredibly strong and sharp.<br><sub><strong>TWOIAF: Dorne- The Andals arrive</strong></sub></p>

  <sub>A Feast for Crows, Brienne IV</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, Master Hubert seems to believe that Galladon was a man of more recent times from Morne and if this is the case it's likely the sword stayed within the family.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many of the folk of Tarth, highborn and low alike, claim descent from a legendary hero, Ser Galladon of Morne, who was said to wield a sword called the Just Maid given to him by the Seven themselves. Given the role that the Just Maid plays in Ser Galladon's tale, Maester Hubert, in his Kin of the Stag, <strong>has suggested that Galladon of Morne was no rude warrior of the Age of Heroes turned into a knight by singers a thousand years later, but an actual historic figure of more recent times. Hubert also notes that Morne was a royal seat of petty kings on the eastern coast of Tarth</strong> until the Storm Kings made them submit, but that its ruins indicate that the site was made by Andals, not First Men.<br>

<blockquote>
  <p>The rest was a rout. Attacked from front and rear, the last great host of the First Men of the Vale was cut to pieces. Thirty lords had come to fight for Robar Royce that day. Not a one survived. And though the singers say the High King slew foes by the score, in the end he, too, was slain. Some say Ser Artys killed him, whilst others name Lord Ruthermont, or Luceon Templeton, the Knight of Ninestars. The Corbrays of Heart's Home have always insisted that it was Ser Jaime Corbray who dealt the mortal blow, and <strong>for proof they point to Lady Forlorn, reclaimed for House Corbray</strong> after the battle.<br>

"46551","What's the story behind Rhaegar Targeryan and Lyanna Stark?","<p>What is the story behind Rhaegar and Lyanna?</p>

<p>I remember reading in one of the books that Rhaegar won the tourney at Harrenhal and named Lyanna Stark the Queen of Love and Beauty. And there's also a mention elsewhere where Robert Baratheon says ""if Rhaegar hadn't laid eyes on Lyanna, she would have been alive"".</p>

<p>Was Rhaegar responsible for Lyanna's death/suffering directly or indirectly?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><fan-theory>","46571","<p>Clues about Rhaegar and Lyanna, together, or by themselves:</p>

<p>Rhaegar is (presumably) mentioned in Daenerys' perspective, in the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_of_the_Undying""><em>House of the Undying prophecies</em></a> (also <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/Prophecies/Entry/1813"">here</a>) like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Rubies flew like drops of blood from the chest of a dying prince, and he sank to his knees in the water and with his last breath murmured a woman's name.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Presumably this woman is Lyanna. Also noted in the prophecies is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>A blue flower grew from a chink in a wall of ice, and filled the air with sweetness.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which may be a reference to Jon (at the Wall), the presumed love child of Lyanna (blue roses) and Rhaegar (link to Daenerys).</p>

<p>And of course, Daenerys sees Rhaegar as one of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_of_the_Undying#Visions_in_the_House_of_the_Undying"">the visions</a> in one of the rooms in the House of the Undying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The man had her brother’s hair, but he was taller, and his eyes were a
  dark indigo rather than lilac. <em>""Aegon,""</em> he said to a woman nursing a
  newborn babe in a great wooden bed. <em>""What better name for a king?""</em></p>
  
  <p><em>""Will you make a song for him?""</em> the woman asked.</p>
  
  <p><em>""He has a song,""</em> the man replied. <em>""He is the prince that was promised,
  and his is the song of ice and fire.""</em> He looked up when he said it and
  his eyes met Dany, and it seemed as if he saw her standing there
  beyond the door. <em>""There must be one more,""</em> he said, though whether he
  was speaking to her or the woman in bed she could not say. <em>""The dragon
  has three heads.""</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The woman would be his wife, Elia of Dorne. Presumably, the ""third head"" he is talking about is Lyanna.</p>

<p>The prohecy Rhaegar is referring to there is the one foretold about <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/The_prince_that_was_promised""><em>the Prince that was Promised</em></a>, which was retold to Rhaegar's great grandfather <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon_V_Targaryen"">Aegon V Targaryen</a> (aka Egg from the Dunk &amp; Egg novels) by the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ghost_of_High_Heart"">Ghost of High Heart</a> (the little dwarf ghost lady that Arya meets when she travels with Lord Beric's gang). She foretold that The Prince that was Promised should come from the line of the mad king Aerys II, which is something that Rhaegar took to heart. Aegon V's daughter is also coincidentally Robert Baratheon's grandmother.</p>

<p>The propecy of the Ghost of High Heart eventually lead to the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tragedy_of_Summerhall"">Tragedy at Summerhall</a>, the Targaryen summer residence which was the seat of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Maekar_I_Targaryen"">Maekar</a>, the father of Aegon V (Egg). The tragedy was presumably the result of an experiment to hatch dragons by Aegon V. Prince Rhaegar was born on the day of that tragedy, and may be the ""dragon"" that was hatched. Rhaegar was often preoccupied with this tragedy, spending time alone in Summerhall and writing sad songs.</p>

<p>In <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Knight_of_the_Laughing_Tree"">the story of the Knight of the Laughing Tree</a>, we see Rhaegar at the tournament at Harrenhal, where he crowns Lyanna the Queen of love and beauty. A theory about this event is that Lyanna is the mystery knight, and that Rhaegar unmasked her, therefore thinking of her as a great warrior maiden (which she by accounts was). Which may be why he crowned her, and why he felt she would be a suitable ""third head"" in his prophecies.</p>

<p>All in all, Rhaegar was a melancholy man that was preoccupied with prophecies. It does not seem likely that he would abduct and rape a woman, like Robert claimed. </p>

<p>Also, of course, we have the promise that Ned Stark made to Lyanna (<em>Promise me, Ned</em> -- AGOT), when she was in her death bed. What could it possibly have been, that Ned would obsess over it during his time in King's Landing and in the dungeons? A good guess would be something to keep secret from Robert, because Robert swore to ""kill all the dragonspawn [he] could get [his] hands on"", such as a son of Rhaegar: Jon.</p>

"180141","Do spring and autumn last as long as summer and winter?","<p>Westeros's climates is ruled by random-length winter and summer. It is said that summer and winter's lengths are correlated: the longer the summer, the longer the winter. But what about spring and autumn? Do spring and autumn last as long as summer and winter?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","180142","<p><strong>TLDR:</strong>
There are at least two notable examples of long summer followed by a much shorter autumn.</p>

<p><strong>Long answer:</strong></p>

<p>As stated before, there are at least two notable examples of long summer followed by a much shorter autumn:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The summer during the reign of Maekar was quite long (seven years), and so the winter (unknow length but hardly suggested to be quite long). However, the autumn was short.</p>

<p>A Game of Thrones - Eddard V</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The heavy jeweled chain around the old man's neck chinked softly as he shifted in his seat. ""To be sure, King Maekar's summer was hotter than this one, and near as long. There were fools, even in the Citadel, who took that to mean that the Great Summer had come at last, the summer that never ends, but in the seventh year it broke suddenly, and we had a short autumn and a terrible long winter"".</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>The current events: At the beginning of the story(around 298 AC), we are on a long summer. The summer ends in 299AC,in the prologue of ACOK, after ten years, two turns(month), and sixteen days. The winter comes in 300AC, during the epilogue of ADWD. Even if we don't know the exact time lapse between the two, it is much more shorter than the summer.</p>

<p>A Clash of Kings - Prologue</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shireen gave a brave little nod. ""Mother said the white raven means it's not summer anymore.""
  ""That is so, my lady. The white ravens fly only from the Citadel."" Cressen's fingers went to the chain about his neck, each link forged from a different metal, each symbolizing his mastery of another branch of learning; the maester's collar, mark of his order. In the pride of his youth, he had worn it easily, but now it seemed heavy to him, the metal cold against his skin. ""They are larger than other ravens, and more clever, bred to carry only the most important messages. This one came to tell us that the Conclave has met, considered the reports and measurements made by maesters all over the realm, and declared this great summer done at last. Ten years, two turns, and sixteen days it lasted, the longest summer in living memory.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A Dance with Dragons - Epilogue</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not silver. White. The bird is white.
  The white ravens of the Citadel did not carry messages, as their dark cousins did. When they went forth from Oldtown, it was for one purpose only: to herald a change of seasons.
  ""Winter,"" said Ser Kevan. The word made a white mist in the air. He turned away from the window.</p>

"180248","Are there any real-life parallels to the Night's Watch and their fall from prestige?","<p>In <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> (and also in the series <em>Game of Thrones</em>), the Night's Watch is a peculiar institution: Regardless of its <em>actual</em> usefulness, it serves a supposedly ""vital"" function which was originally considered an honorable endeavor by all cultures which partook in the tradition. In other words, the Night's Watch was considered a vital and beneficial institution, and joining the watch was considered a very honorable thing to do. Over time, however, the practical function of the Night's Watch changed from ""guarding the realms of men"" to being a last resort for criminals, the disinherited and the disgraced. Over time, it gained a stigma among most people, but this stigma failed to gain much traction in one place &mdash; namely, <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/179594/65294"">in the North</a>. Likewise, although the Watch is pretty much considered by Southerners to serve <em>only</em> as an alternative to death and/or (even greater) disgrace, it seems that some Northerners still willingly join (such as <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/ConQuest_Kansas_City_MO_May_27_294"" rel=""noreferrer"">Benjen Stark</a> did).</p>

<p>Visualizing the practical function of the Night's Watch for respective regions compared to their perception of the Night's Watch in a table suggests that the perception of the Night's Watch is correlated with the function of it over time: As all the non-Northern kingdoms used the Watch for ever less-reputable reasons, it begins to be perceived as less reputable as well... but this trend doesn't hold with Northern culture(s) as far as the books seem to portray it/them (albeit that nearly all information provided is from the point of view of noblemen rather than the common folk):</p>

<pre><code>        | The North                           | Elsewhere                   |
        |-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
Era     | Function               | Perception | Function     | Perception   |
--------| -----------------------|------------|--------------|--------------| 
Earlier | Reputable              | Reputable  | Reputable    | Reputable    |
Later   | Reputable/disreputable | Reputable  | Disreputable | Disreputable |
</code></pre>

<p>It strikes me as very much... fantasy that such a well-established tradition can exist and ""degrade"" so much and yet be ""tolerated"" for so long while one significant group remains an ""outlier"" in still valuing it. However, <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/143522/65294"">G.R.R. Martin takes liberal inspiration from history</a>, so it may be possible that the Night's Watch was inspired by some parts of real-world history... knowingly or otherwise. So, <strong>are/were there any real-life institutions/orders/traditions which originally served a highly-respected function to everyone but became stigmatized over time to everyone except for a certain subculture and yet continued to exist for a long time<sup>&dagger;</sup>?</strong></p>

<p>The only (very weak) parallel I can think of is that of monastic orders such as the Benedictines, but it doesn't fit very well because they're not <em>stigmatized</em> but simply entail a career path and lifestyle that not many aspire to following these days. Is there <em>any</em> institution in real-world history which has gone from holding an esteemed function in society to being heavily stigmatized and its function degraded... and yet continued to exist for so long? </p>

<p>This made me think whether there is a legal age to drink wine or ale in Westeros. In Winterfell, there is a hint regarding this because Sansa Stark says in the earlier seasons to Joffrey that her father didn't allow more than two cups of wine. </p>

<p>So, is there a legal age to drink wine in Westeros or is it a bad writing?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><age>","180470","<p><strong>Unlikely any official age.</strong></p>

<p>The common theory is that during medieval times water sources were not particularly clean and therefore beer, wine, and mead were common beverages during meal times. </p>

<p>However, they were not like the alcoholic beverages of today. Typically children were served what is known as a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_beer"" rel=""noreferrer"">small beer</a> which has a lower alcohol content than normal beers such as ale. The same is true of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mead"" rel=""noreferrer"">mead</a>, which had widely varying degrees of alcohol by volume (ABV) but was easily watered down. It is even possible that the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wort"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wort</a> (the mixture of sugar before fermenting) might have been used as a beverage which while still sanitary had no alcohol.</p>

<p>Although, children would obviously be more susceptible to getting drunk on even smaller amounts of alcohol and parents would have to regulate how much their children consumed. This well explains Sansa's quote about being allowed only one or two cups while she was still in the 12-14 age range. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They dined on trout fresh from the river, and Sansa <strong>drank more wine than she had ever drunk before.</strong> ""My father only lets us have one cup, and only at feasts,"" she confessed to her prince.
  ""My betrothed can drink as much as she wants,"" Joffrey said, refilling her cup.</p>
  
  <p>They went more slowly after they had eaten. Joffrey sang for her as they rode, his voice high and sweet and pure. <strong>Sansa was a little dizzy from the wine.</strong> </p>
  
  <p><em>A Game of Thrones - Sansa I</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Arya is allowed to have beer in small quantities even at age 9.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Her father sometimes let them have a cup of beer, she remembered. Sansa used to make a face at the taste and say that wine was ever so much finer, but Arya had liked it well enough.</p>
  
  <p><em>A Clash of Kings - Arya II</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would take the solider asking Arya about if she old enough to drink, not as bad writing but perhaps as, ""Are you old enough to handle the alcohol."", much like she was by a common-folk;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Sharna's husband, and an orphan boy they took in. They won't harm you. <strong>There's ale, if you think you're old enough.</strong> Fresh bread and maybe a bit of meat."" Tom glanced toward the cottage. ""And whatever you stole from Old Pate's garden besides.""</p>

These can be created by forming an industry with focus on a certain kind of goods i.e. 300 skilled smiths working for one employer together as a team to produce swords.</p>

<p>We know there are some guilds such as Tourmaline Brotherhood, Ancient Guild of Spicers, the Thirteen, etc. However they appear to be more like councils/alliances of traders who buy goods from local producers and move them around. </p>

<p>Hypothetically, it is plausible that some rich merchant might decide to produce goods in an industrial fashion i.e. hire/buy some pot-makers to make fancy pots for him to fill the market with while providing them with tools and resources needed by them to do their jobs. Based on that hypothesis, are there any industries that we know of in Westeros or Essos?</p>

"180824","How much creative independence are the Show runners accorded in Game of Thrones?","<p>Since Season 3, we have been observing that the show was taking a different direction than the books. Many important characters never made it into the show, others who are still alive were killed off. </p>

<p>As we know the show is supposed to be based on the books, not to be direct adaption of the books from print to television media, there's bound to be a certain degree of creative independence accorded to them by the author of the series, George R.R. Martin. </p>

<p>The question is, how much independence do they have? Do they still have to take GRRM on board with whatever changes they might intend to make? By ""they"" I mean D&amp;D and the whole writers crew for the show. Given the number of significant changes they have made, I reckon the answer would be a lot. Has GRRM or HBO ever commented on that?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>How independent are the showrunners from you?</strong> Simply put: could they save the life of a character you’ve decided to kill? Or
  could they kill someone who’s still alive in your books?</p>
  
  <p><strong>GRRM:</strong> <strong>They are independent. They can do whatever they want. I don’t have any power… any contractual right to [stop them]. I consult
  with them. I talk to them on a regular basis. Of course, years ago, we
  had a series of very long meetings, where I told them some of the big
  twists and turns and huge events that were coming in the last few
  books. So they’ve been touching [on] some of these, and doing some of
  the reveals, but they have also been departing in various ways.</strong></p>
  
  <p>The biggest one is one that you just mentioned: probably right now,
  right as we talk, there are close to 20 characters who are dead on the
  show, who are still alive in the books. Some of them are very minor
  characters, but also there are major characters, like Rickon Stark,
  Barristan Selmy, Myrcella Baratheon. All of them — dead on the show,
  but alive in the books.</p>
  
  <p>There are also a number of characters in the books — fairly important
  characters — who have never been in the show at all. Characters who
  were omitted totally. It’s not a question of killing them; they’re
  just not there. They were never a part of it: Lady Stoneheart is one
  of them; Arianne Martell, the heir to Dorne, who’s a viewpoint
  character; and Victarion Greyjoy, one of the sons of Quellon Greyjoy
  and brother to Balon and Euron. All of these characters are quite
  important in the books and missing totally in the show.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> How has your involvement in the show changed over time?</p>
  
  <p><strong>GRRM:</strong> I’m a co-executive producer on the show; David and Dan are the showrunners. Right from the first, <strong>we knew that they were going
  to do the lion’s share of the work</strong>, but I did wanted to be involved.
  I<strong>nitially, I was involved in all the casting</strong> — I wasn’t physically
  present — I was here in Santa Fe. But through the wonders of the
  internet, I was able to look at all of the actors reading and to write
  them long letters and to have phone calls where I discussed which
  actors I like and which actors I didn’t like. <strong>And in the early
  seasons, I wrote one script per season.</strong> I would have gladly done
  more, but there just wasn’t time. I’m still trying to do these books.
  <strong>It takes me about a month to write a script and I didn’t have a month to spare, so I said, I think I’ll sit out season 5. I’ve sat out
  seasons 6 and 7 too</strong>, just trying to concentrate on this book, which
  as you know is massively late. So in that sense, <strong>my involvement in
  the show has diminished over time</strong>, though, I’m still here whenever
  they want to talk to me, and I’m always glad to weigh in. David and
  Dan have come to Santa Fe and we’ve discussed many of the ultimate
  developments, those landmarks that I spoke to at the end of the road
  that we’re both driving for. <strong>So I don’t need to be quite as involved

"181009","Does it matter what religion a king follows?","<p>King Robert Baratheon and several Targaryen Kings before him adhered to the Faith of the Seven. </p>

<p>The crown/throne and the High Septon are on really good terms with each other and most people of the Seven Kingdoms are followers of the Faith of the Seven, Except for the Northmen who believe in the Old gods and the Ironborn who believe in the Drowned God.</p>

<p>What would happen if someone (like Stannis Baratheon), who doesn't follow the Seven, the Old gods or the Drowned god, were to (or try to) become the new King of Westeros?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","181073","<p>Other than what TLC has covered, religion is a sensitive issue in Westeros. </p>

<p>Majority of the people in Westeros adhere to the Faith and followers of other religions are in minority, specifically limited to the North and Iron Islands disregarding small exceptions like Blackwoods in Riverlands and Manderleys in the North. Ever since Aegon took the throne and converted to the Faith, it has been generally accepted that the King must be from the majority religion i.e. the Faith. It is implied due to the fact that Northmen and Ironborn kept their vows for most of the times. That can be attributed to the internal autonomy of the both regions, neither of them answer to anyone other than the King and are free to rule themselves as they wish as long as they keep faith with the Crown and do not break the King's laws. These responsibilities lie on shoulders of the Lords Paramounts of both regions. </p>

<p>But that does not mean that People in Westeros do not generally care about the religion. </p>

<p>When King Aenys I tried to marry his daughter to his son, he was denounced as ""King abomination"" by the High Septon and was soon fighting a rebellion. This Valyrian tradition was not welcome at all in the faith of the Seven.  Lords and Commons alike took sides with thousands rallying to the Sept to protect the Faith. It would end only in the reign of King Jaehaerys I who disbanded the faith militant and vowed that the Crown shall always defend the Holy Mother Sept, a vow all Targaryens kept. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some counselors urged the Old King to deal with the remnants of the
  Faith Militant harshly—to stamp them out once and for all before their
  zealotry could return the realm to chaos. Others cared more for
  ensuring that the septons were answerable to the same justice as the
  rest of the realm. But Jaehaerys instead dispatched Septon Barth to
  Oldtown, to speak with the High Septon, and there they began to forge
  a lasting agreement. <strong>In return for the last few Stars and Swords
  putting down their weapons, and for agreeing to accept outside
  justice, the High Septon received King Jaehaerys's sworn oath that the
  Iron Throne would always protect and defend the Faith</strong>. In this way,
  the great schism between crown and Faith was forever healed.<br><sub><strong>TWOIAF -Targaryen Kings : Jaehaerys I</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So while the Faith is happy to be peaceful as long as a follower of the Faith, in this case the King, guarantees to always defend the Faith against religious threats, why should they believe vows of a non-believer to be genuine? If someone who kept other gods than the Seven took the throne, that would force the Sept to reconsider their arrangement with the Crown naturally. How long before the heathen outlaws their one true faith eh? Or persecutes them? Or forces people to convert to their superstition?</p>

<p>The religious minorities were forced to tolerate the Faith once Aegon converted and took the throne, given the Targaryen power. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And <strong>since Aegon had accepted the Seven as his gods and been anointed
  by the High Septon in Oldtown, Lord Vickon allowed the septons to
  return to the islands once again to preach the Faith</strong>.</p>
  
  <p><strong>This angered many pious ironborn and provoked the wroth of the priests of the Drowned God, as it always had before</strong>. ""Let them
  preach,"" Lord Vickon said, when told of the unrest. ""We have need of
  winds to fill our sails."" He was Aegon's man, he reminded his son
  Goren, and no man but a fool would dare rise against Aegon Targaryen
  and his dragons.<br><sub><strong>TWOIAF -The Iron Islands : The Greyjoys of Pyke</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>They let them preach because as long as the Throne did not force the conversion, there was no reason to risk a confrontation with the Crown. But Goren got rid of the Faith soon.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These were words that Goren Greyjoy would remember. When Lord Vickon
  died in 33 AC, Goren succeeded him as Lord of the Iron Islands,
  putting down a clumsy conspiracy to restore the black line by crowning
  Qhorin Volmark's son in his stead. He faced a more serious test four
  years later, when Aegon the Conqueror died of a stroke on Dragonstone,
  and his son Aenys was crowned king in his stead. Though amiable and
  well-meaning, Aenys Targaryen was widely perceived as a weakling,
  unfit to sit the Iron Throne. The new king was still on his royal
  progress when rebellions began to break out all across the realm. One
  such revolt convulsed the Iron Islands, led by a man claiming that he
  was the priestking Lodos returned at last from visiting his father. </p>
  
  <p>But Goren Greyjoy dealt with it decisively, going so far as to send
  the priestking's pickled head to Aenys Targaryen. <strong>His Grace was so
  pleased with the gift that he promised Lord Goren any boon that was
  within his power to grant</strong>. As sage as he was savage, <strong>Greyjoy asked
  the king to give him leave to expel the septons and septas from the
  Iron Islands</strong>. King Aenys was forced to agree. A century would pass
  before another sept was opened on the islands.<br><sub><strong>TWOIAF -The Iron Islands : The Greyjoys of Pyke</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the Septons did return, that shows that the minorities, while willing to accept the Crown's authority, were not okay with influence of the other religions on them. If minorities feel that way, Majority would feel that as well and more strongly if follower of some other faith was to rule them. </p>

<p>Lannisters used exactly that against Stannis when he took the faith of the Red Priests.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tyrion made a show of glancing over the writing again. There had been
  some niggling phrase . . . ""Done in the Light of the Lord,"" he read.
  ""A queer choice of words, that.""</p>
  
  <p>Pycelle cleared his throat. ""These words often appear in letters and
  documents from the Free Cities. They mean no more than, let us say,
  written in the sight of god. The god of the red priests. It is their
  usage, I do believe.""</p>
  
  <p>""Varys told us some years past that Lady Selyse had taken up with a
  red priest,"" Littlefinger reminded them.</p>
  
  <p>Tyrion tapped the paper. ""And now it would seem her lord husband has
  done the same. We can use that against him. <strong>Urge the High Septon to
  reveal how Stannis has turned against the gods as well as his rightful
  king</strong> . . .""<br><sub><strong>ACOK - Tyrion III</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since the High Septon is considered to be voice of the gods on Earth by the majority, his words will carry great weight. </p>

<p>Cersei tried to use the same support for Tommen:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Most have lost their homes. Suffering is everywhere... and grief, and
  death. Before coming to King’s Landing, I tended to half a hundred
  little villages too small to have a septon of their own. I walked from
  each one to the next, performing marriages, absolving sinners of their
  sins, naming newborn children. Those villages are no more, Your Grace.
  Weeds and thorns grow where gardens once flourished, and bones litter
  the roadsides.”</p>
  
  <p>“War is a dreadful thing. <strong>These atrocities are the work of the
  northmen, and of Lord Stannis and his demon-worshipers</strong>.”</p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <p>“<strong>The realm is full of kings</strong>. For the Faith to exalt one above the
  rest we must be certain. Three hundred years ago, when Aegon the
  Dragon landed beneath this very hill, the High Septon locked himself
  within the Starry Sept of Oldtown and prayed for seven days and seven
  nights, taking no nourishment but bread and water. When he emerged he
  announced that the Faith would not oppose Aegon and his sisters, for
  the Crone had lifted up her lamp to show him what lay ahead. If
  Oldtown took up arms against the Dragon, Oldtown would burn, and the
  Hightower and the Citadel and the Starry Sept would be cast down and
  destroyed. Lord Hightower was a godly man. When he heard the prophecy,
  he kept his strength at home and opened the city gates to Aegon when
  he came. And His High Holiness anointed the Conqueror with the seven
  oils. I must do as he did, three hundred years ago. I must pray, and
  fast.”</p>
  
  <p>“For seven days and seven nights?”</p>
  
  <p>“For as long as need be.”</p>
  
  <p>Cersei itched to slap his solemn, pious face. I could help you fast,
  she thought. I could shut you up in some tower and see that no one
  brings you food until the gods have spoken. “<strong>These false kings
  espouse false gods,</strong>” she reminded him. “<strong>Only King Tommen defends
  the Holy Faith.</strong>”<br><sub><strong>AFFC - Cersei VI</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But Zealotry is a two-way street. Luckily, most of the Kings, even Aerys II, had the wisdom to tread carefully in the matters of faith and did not vex the religious minorities in the North and Iron Isles. Baelor the Blessed was however not that wise and in his reign, the relations were set to be soured between the Crown and the minorities due to his zealotry. Thanks to the alleged intervention of his uncle Viserys, the King could not begin his project to force conversion of all his subjects and the Targaryen dynasty did not face a revolt in the North and the West.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Malicious rumors that followed in the wake of Viserys's
  ascension—begun, some say, by the pen of the Lady Maia of House
  Stokeworth—suggested that Viserys poisoned the king in order to
  finally gain the throne after a decade and more of waiting. Others
  have suggested that <strong>Viserys poisoned Baelor for the good of the
  realm, since the septon-king had come to believe that the Seven called
  on him to convert all the unbelievers in his realm. This would have
  led to a war with the North and the Iron Islands that would have
  caused great turmoil</strong>.<br><sub><strong>TWOIAF -Targaryen Kings : Baelor I</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in conclusion, yes it definitely matters which religion does the King follow. The King is the defender of Holy Mother Sept and therefore cannot espouse any other religion if he is to be seen that way. Furthermore, given the demographics of the realm, it is imperative that the King must have the same religion as the majority of the People. That being said, it is also equally important for the King to refrain from antagonizing the powerful minorities in the West and North and act like a symbol of unity for all the Westerosi people, regardless to their faith. </p>

The Martells never forgot that it was the Lannister bannermen who did it and Prince Oberyn suspected it was Tywin's payback for Aerys choosing Elia to be Rhaegar's bride instead of Cersei. </p>

<p>When the War of the Five Kings began, it is curious that Doran did not declare for any side. It makes sense why he would not join the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Balon Greyjoy - Too distant, small chances of success.</li>
<li>Robb Stark - Too distant, small chances of success. </li>
<li>Stannis Baratheon - Little to no chance of success. </li>
<li>Joffrey Baratheon - Cersei's son, Grandson to Tywin, supported by might of the Rock.</li>
</ol>

<p>That leaves one man, Renly Baratheon. Renly was right next to Dorne and had a huge army, was beloved by the commons and had the wealth of Tyrells behind him. He had the best chance of victory. If Doran were to support him, he could finally get revenge for Elia and get the new King to destroy House Lannister. Yet, he did not. </p>

<p>If avenging Elia was all that he wanted, why not join Renly?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","181099","<p>While there certainly was a blood feud between Lannisters and Martells, they did not exactly believe the Baratheons to be innocent of the murders. After all, Robert was the leader of the Rebels. And given the sour relations between the two, Doran never came to KL and Robert never visited Dorne. </p>

<p>In addition, there are centuries of enmity between the Stormlander and the Dornish which was not going to end magically. Not to mention, Renly's chief allies were the Tyrells, another one of traditional enemies of the Martells. </p>

<p>GRRM personally commented on why Doran did not consider joining Renly:</p>

  <p>Q:  [Why did Doran not join Renly against the Lannisters?]</p>
  
  <p>GRRM: Doran plays to win, whether at cyvasse or the game of thrones. Likely
  he did not see Renly as a winner. The emnity[sic] between Dorne and

<p>Since Targaryen funeral rites were respected, it seems likely that the loyalists managed to recover the corpse whether via force or as a gesture of respect from the Rebels. Given how much Robert hated Rhaegar, it is unlikely that he would have returned the corpse had he gotten his hands on it. He may have preferred to mutilate his corpse or something of that sort. It seems more plausible that the loyalists recovered the corpse before fleeing or someone among the Rebel lords quietly handed over the corpse while Robert was recovering from the wounds he took.</p>

<p>There is however no canon evidence about any of that. We just know that Rhaegar's end was writ in flames, like all Targaryens before him.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The master of ships is the king on the Iron Throne's advisor charged with commanding the royal fleet and is a member of the small council in King's Landing. Duties of the master of ships include arranging for the building and maintenance of warships, obtaining crews for the warships, and commanding naval operations. (<a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Master_of_ships"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A Wiki of Ice and Fire</a>)</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The master of ships position dates to the Conquest. </p>

<p>However, the Seven Kingdoms doesn't have a standing army; all armies are drawn from a lord's warriors and their vassals'. The lords of the Crownlands are sworn directly to the king, but to my understanding, there is no royal army. </p>

<p>Why does the king have a personal navy but not a personal army? Is this a historical truism? </p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","181120","<p>Looking among the fleets in Westeros,</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Highgarden</strong> does not have a navy, however the <strong>Arbor Navy</strong>, one of the largest naval force in Westeros answers to Lord of Highgarden through Lord of Arbor.</li>
<li><strong>The North</strong> does not have any navy, however the <strong>White Harbor Navy</strong> is under the North command through Lord Manderly.</li>
<li>It is not specified if <strong>Riverlands</strong> has a navy other than its river capable boats, however, <strong>Mallisters</strong> have a navy to protect themselves from Iron Islands.</li>
<li><strong>Dorne</strong> has a formidable naval force, however it is not specified if it answers directly to the Prince of Dorne or through vassals under Dorne.</li>
<li>To the best of my knowledge, <strong>Westerlands</strong> lost their navy during the Greyjoy Rebellion. Whether vassals under Westerlands have a navy is not specified.</li>
<li><strong>Gulltown</strong> had a small navy during Robert's Rebellion, however it is unknown if it still has one. Also, it is unknown if vassals under <strong>Vale</strong> or the Vale itself have any navy.</li>
<li>The navies of <strong>Stormlands</strong> or its vassals are not specified.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, the most important one:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lords in <strong>Iron Islands</strong> have their own navies, some of which are more formidable than navies of the Great Houses. Moreover, <strong>the Iron Fleet</strong> is directly commanded by the Seastone Chair, i.e., Pyke.</li>
</ul>

<p>In conclusion, some of the great houses have navies through their vassals and some of them have their own navies. Crownlands in principle is similar to other great houses so it may or it may not have its own navy. One more point is that Crownlands, just like any other great house, can summon its own army. In the non-canon RPG game, their military capability is specified as 15k, however considering the population of the King's Landing, it can be much more.</p>

<p><strong>Real World Examples</strong></p>

<p>Most of the great empires had drawn most of their land forces from local lords, however, many of them had their own standing navy in medieval ages. I know English Navy and Ottoman Navy are two examples proving that point. The only example I know where vassals provide naval force is Vikings.</p>

<p>I believe it is due to two reasons.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ships are very expensive and building navies require careful planning for extended periods, which may not be available to local lords.</li>
<li>Naval personnel is much harder to train, i.e., you can expect a peasant to form a three deep spear formation, but you cannot expect a peasant to operate on a ship. For example, after the disastrous <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lepanto"" rel=""noreferrer"">Battle of Lepanto</a>, Ottomans rebuilt their navy in six months. However, since they did not have experienced seamen they did not engage in any battle in spite having one of the greatest navies in Mediterranean. </li>

"181182","Are there any transgender characters in Westeros?","<p>We have seen a myriad of sexual orientations and genders in the world GRRM has created. </p>

<p>One thing however seems virtually unheard of, that's transgender people.</p>

<p>Are there any characters from the current timeline or history who have shown indications that they might be transgender? I know some people argue that Brienne is transgender given how she feels awkward about feminine identity but I think they are wrong. Brienne has shown us that she is a female down there, when she thinks about the life she might have had, had she been married off to Blackhaven to wed Lord Dondarrion's heir. She pictures herself as a mother there. And then she pours her heart out in front of the Elder brother of the monastery, which pretty much confirms that she is a female both by birth and deep down in her heart. And of course, she was attracted to Renly Baratheon as well, so she is straight. Another candidate often presented is Lysono Maar, a sellsword associated with the Golden Company who looks like a woman and paints his nails. But Lysono has explicitly said in TWOW preview chapters that he is not a woman. He just appears to be a guy born with feminine looks, who is confident about the way he looks. Then of course we have Cersei who has shown resentment that she should have been born a man over a number of times but that's mostly when someone denies her something they wouldn't deny a man or when she regrets that she could have been Lord Tywin's heir if she were born with a penis. Therefore, she doesn't seem like someone with trans tendencies either.</p>

<p>Those three aside then, do we have anyone else?</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I am not the most well-versed person around regarding the modern take on sexuality and gender. My question is about people who are born in one gender but want to be another. Keeping that aim in mind, If you believe that I may have used some terms or labels incorrectly in the question, please feel free to correct that by editing. Thank you. </p>

<p>He was grandson to King Loreon IV, known as Loreon the Lackwit. It is unclear if Loreon IV's son (Loreon V's father) ever inherited the throne or not but nevertheless, Loreon V took the throne either on his father's death or his grandfather's death.</p>

The Emperor is described to have been ""delighted to be called the mistress, the wife, the queen of Hierocles"". It is said that he also used to pretend to be a prostitute in the Palace where the courtiers and guards would play the role of the patrons. He also reportedly offered large sums of money to any physician who could equip him female Genitalia. Which is why some modern historians argue that he may have been a transwoman.</p>

<p>We see the decisive Rhoynar influence in the way Dornish look, the way their succession laws work and the way their rulers are styled as Prince/Princess.</p>

<p>But those were not the only things Nymeria brought, she also brought the Rhoynar religion with her based on worship of Mother Rhoyne, the Old man of the River etc.</p>

<p>But we don't see that religion being followed by the Dornish today. How did the Andal religion come to dominate Dorne?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","181192","<p>When Nymeria came to Dorne, it wasn't exactly an empty land.</p>

<p>First Men were the first to settle Dorne and after them, came the Andal invaders with their seven gods.</p>

<p>Nymeria and Rhoynar were the last to migrate to Westeros. When she came, Faith of the Seven was already established in Dorne. Most of the Rhoynar refugees were women and young men who intermarried with the Dornish when their Princess did.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is said that, <strong>amongst the Rhoynar who came to Dorne with Nymeria,
  eight of every ten were women</strong> … but a quarter of those were
  warriors, in the Rhoynish tradition, and even those who did not fight
  had been hardened during their travels and travails. As well,
  thousands who had been boys when fleeing the Rhoyne had grown into
  manhood and taken up the spear during their years of wandering.</p>
  
  <p>By joining with the newcomers, the Martells increased the size of
  their host by tenfold. <strong>When Mors Martell took Nymeria to wife,
  hundreds of his knights, squires, and lords bannermen also wed
  Rhoynish women, and many of those who were already wed took them for
  their paramours</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>Thus were the two peoples united by blood. These unions enriched and
  strengthened House Martell and its Dornish allies.<br><sub><strong>TWOIAF: Ancient History - 10,000 Ships</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it was by marriages that the Rhoynar in Dorne converted to the Faith of the Seven over the course of the coming years. That however does not mean all Rhoynar gave up their religion, the Orphans of the Greenblood still worship the Rhoyne.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""It is a long journey,"" Arianne said, ""but it will go easier once we
  reach the Greenblood. <strong>Some of Garin's people will meet us there, the
  orphans of the river</strong>. They live on boats, and pole them up and down
  the Greenblood and its vassals, fishing and picking fruit and doing
  whatever work needs doing.""</p>
  
  <p>""Aye,"" Garin called out cheerfully, ""and we sing and play and dance on
  water, and know much and more of healing. My mother is the best
  midwife in Westeros, and my father can cure warts.""</p>
  
  <p>""How can you be orphans if you have mothers and fathers?"" the girl
  asked.</p>
  
  <p>""<strong>They are the Rhoynar</strong>,"" Arianne explained, ""<strong>and their Mother was
  the river Rhoyne.</strong>""</p>
  
  <p>Myrcella did not understand. ""<strong>I thought you were the Rhoynar. You
  Dornishmen</strong>, I mean.""</p>
  
  <p>""<strong>We are in part, Your Grace. Nymeria's blood is in me</strong>, <strong>along
  with that of Mors Martell, the Dornish lord she married</strong>. On the day
  they wed, Nymeria fired her ships, so her people would understand that
  there could be no going back. Most were glad to see those flames, for
  their voyagings had been long and terrible before they came to Dorne,
  and many and more had been lost to storm, disease, and slavery.
  <strong>There were a few who mourned, however. They did not love this dry red land or its seven-faced god, so they clung to their old ways,
  hammered boats together from the hulks of the burned ships, and became
  the orphans of the Greenblood</strong>. The Mother in their songs is not our
  Mother, but Mother Rhoyne, whose waters nourished them from the dawn
  of days.""<br><sub><strong>AFFC: The Queenmaker</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>George R.R. Martin also attributes this religious change to intermarriages:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Linda</strong>: <strong>Do (or did) the Dornishmen follow gods other than those of the</strong> <strong>First Men or the Andals, because of the Rhoynar?</strong> If so, does this
  have anything at all to do with the ruling Martell of Dorne calling
  him or herself Prince or Princess?</p>
  
  <p><strong>George_RR_Martin</strong>: The Dornishmen may have a few odd gods lying about, <strong>but they were pretty much assimiliated by intermarriage</strong>, so
  the Seven dominate down there too. The ""prince"" was the style of the
  ruler of their original cities, along the Rhoyne River.<br><sub><a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20001210110800/http://www.eventhorizon.com:80/sfzine/chats/transcripts/031899.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Web Chat with Fans</a> - Citadel link <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Event_Horizon_Chat"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unlike Dorne however, North was never conquered by the Andals and the dominion of the first men continued there until the day Aegon the Conqueror decided to unite Westeros. There was no major change in demographics even before or after that and that's why the Old Gods still hold sway in the North unlike Dorne where the Rhoynar were mostly absorbed into the locals. </p>

<p>This leads the the question of why this is? Is it explained anywhere in the novels and I simply missed it? Or is it inferred that suicide is treated as a sin from the viewpoint of the various gods/religions that exist in-universe (as it is in certain religions that exist in reality)?<br>
Alternatively, please provide an example of such a situation if I have simply forgotten an instance/discussion of suicide?</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Lady is killed very early on </p>
</blockquote>

<p>we cannot know whether Sansa would have had the warg dreams like Arya, Bran and Jon Snow. Are we meant to infer that <em>all</em> of the Stark children are wargs (or have the potential to be so) or is this exclusive to Arya, Bran and Jon.</p>

<p>We never get a chapter from the point of view of Robb or Rickon, but throughout the book there is common mention of how dissimilar Sansa and Arya are and how alike Arya and Jon are. I am wondering if this is due to the Stark (as opposed to the Tully) blood. We are constantly reminded of how similar Sansa is to her mother - at least in terms of appearance.</p>

<p>Are we meant to infer that it is the Stark genes that are responsible for this or is this an over simplification?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","48178","<p>When I read the title of this question, my first and foremost thought was: Does it matter? In the grand scheme of things, we shall see what we shall see: Bran is doing his thing, Arya her thing, Sansa her thing, and Jon his thing. What Rickon does, we do not know (yet). </p>

<p>My second thought was, yes, of course it <em>did</em> matter way back when, when I first read the series. </p>

<p>I've had a while to think about this, so perhaps I can review my thoughts.</p>

<p>In <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, the very first book, the very first chapter, the very first few pages, Jon Snow says to Lord Eddard Stark, regarding the direwolf pups found in the snow:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You have five trueborn children,"" Jon said. ""Three sons, two daughters. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then we find out that there is another pup, one that is all white.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""An albino,"" Theon Greyjoy said with wry amusement. ""This one will
  die even faster than the others.""</p>
  
  <p>Jon Snow gave his father's ward a long, chilling look. ""I think not,
  Greyjoy,"" he said. ""This one belongs to me.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is clear from the very start of the book that this is supposed to mean something. I believe the first person to know how special this bond is is Bran, although I cannot safely say what order this happened. But I do remember the moment when Bran woke up after his long coma dreams, scaring a serving woman to death:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When his brother Robb burst into the room, breathless from his dash up the tower steps, the direwolf was licking Bran's face. Bran looked up calmly. ""His name is Summer,"" he said. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We get countless examples of Bran dreaming ""wolf dreams"", which makes it redundant to elaborate on Bran/Summer. We also know that Jon has some intense moments where he and Ghost are connected in some otherworldly way, such as when he sees the huge wildling camp at the Milkwater through Ghost's eyes.</p>

<p>We also know that Arya has vivid dreams of Nymeria, such as when Nymeria swims out into the river and drags Catelyn Stark's body to the shore, and the next morning, Arya knows her mother is dead.</p>

<p>We also see Arya in Braavos, seeing through the eyes of a cat when <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Kindly_Man"">the kindly old man</a> is playing tricks on her, and know that she still is having wolf dreams.</p>

<p>Sansa is the only one who never has any wolf dreams, or visions through <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lady_%28direwolf%29"">her direwolf Lady</a>. We do know that Lady, like all the other direwolves, reflected her owners personality in her own: She was well-behaved and ladylike. She was killed rather early on, through Sansa's own cowardice, so we do not know much of that. We do know, however, that Sansa tamed another large and dangerous canine: <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/The_Hound"">Sandor ""The Hound"" Clegane</a>. Read the chapters, I am sure you will see what I am talking about.</p>

<p>Then there is Robb. The forlorn lord, who lost the north. We do not know what goes on in Robb's mind. But we do know that the extra sensory perception that was evident in all the wolves: The ability to sense evil or betrayal in people, the ability to sense danger, or grief, was also present in <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Grey_Wind"">Grey Wind</a>. But Robb pushed aside his intuition and his trust in Grey Wind, when the untrue rumour of his brothers' demise reached him.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Catelyn] ""Any man Grey Wind mislikes is a man I do not want close to you.
  These wolves are more than wolves, Robb. You must know that. I think
  perhaps the gods sent them to us. Your father's gods, the old gods of
  the north. Five wolf pups, Robb, five for five Stark children.""</p>
  
  <p>""Six,"" said Robb. ""There was a wolf for Jon as well. I found them,
  remember? I know how many there were and where they came from. I used
  to think the same as you, that the wolves were our guardians, our
  protectors, until . . . ""</p>
  
  <p>""Until?"" she prompted.</p>
  
  <p>Robb's mouth tightened. "" . . . Until they told me that Theon had
  murdered Bran and Rickon. Small good their wolves did them. I am no
  longer a boy, Mother. I'm a king, and I can protect myself."" He
  sighed. ""I will find some duty for Ser Rolph, some pretext to send him
  away. Not because of his smell, but to ease your mind. You have
  suffered enough.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Robb chooses not to believe. He is a King, and he lacks the confidence to believe in supernatural things. Despite Grey Wind being almost a part of him at this time, fighting beside him in battles, he allows <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Westerling"">the Westerlings</a> and <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Frey"">the Freys</a> to get between him and his wolf. When he should have trusted his wolf, he does not, and suffers for it. An event that is also shadowed in the events surrounding Jon in ADWD.</p>

<p>Last but not least is Rickon and Shaggydog. It is clear to me that Shaggydog is very much in touch with Rickon's feelings. Rickon is the ""wild wolf"" in the family, and spending all this time with Osha and the wildlings (and unicorns!), the next time we see him, it is sure to be a lively event. The most remarkable event in this context is, I think, in Bran's POV, when Bran convinces Maester Luwin to take him down into the crypts to see if Lord Eddard is, in fact, down there. And instead they find Rickon and Shaggydog, and it turns out Rickon had the same dreams as Bran.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Shaggy,"" a small voice called. When Bran looked up, his little
  brother was standing in the mouth of Father's tomb. With one final
  snap at Summer's face, Shaggydog broke off and bounded to Rickon's
  side. ""You let my father be,"" Rickon warned Luwin. ""You let him be.""</p>
  
  <p>""Rickon,"" Bran said softly. ""Father's not here.""</p>
  
  <p>""Yes he is. I saw him."" Tears glistened on Rickon's face. ""I saw him
  last night.""</p>
  
  <p>""In your dream . . . ?""</p>
  
  <p>Rickon nodded. ""You leave him. You leave him be. He's coming home now,
  like he promised. He's coming home.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I would say, yes, all of the Stark children have some of the ""wolf blood"" in them. Bran the most, and Sansa the least. But Jon and Arya have strong experiences as well, and while we do not know the inner thoughts of Robb or Rickon, they do seem to share the same kind of bond with their wolves.</p>

"181561","How much Valyrian steel is there that is unused for link making and why aren't people making weapons out of it?","<p>I was reading <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/51275/53771"">an answer by Valorum</a> that stated Maesters can have Valyrian steel links:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Valyrian Steel links (for the study of Magic + the Occult) are exceedingly rare and held by less than one Maester in a hundred. Ironically, they aren't seen as especially prestigious but rather viewed with suspicion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This made me wonder how much Valyrian steel there is lying around for Maesters to be adding them to their chains. It seems like such <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Valyrian_steel"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a rare and valuable</a> resource like this would be used for crafting weapons not being kept as ingots ready for Maesters to make links.</p>

<p>Indeed the Wiki I linked above claims:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the amount of Valyrian steel in the world is finite and extremely rare</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How much of his extremely rare resource is being kept in reserve for link making and why hasn't it been used for more useful stuff like making weapons?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","181573","<p>The real canon answer is, We don't know as of yet much about the Valyrian reserves Citadel have. So it is impossible to provide a definite answer as of now. We can however make informed speculation based on what George has provided us for.</p>

<p>It can be argued that the Valyrian steel is not lying around. It appears that there are pre-existing links at the Citadel which are under the custody of the Archmaesters. When a Maester learns enough about Higher Mysteries, he may request the Archmaesters to grant him one of the link. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Now the question. Do maesters fully forge the links of their chokers from raw metal, or do they take strips of existing metal and
  forge it into the links?</p>
  
  <p><strong>GRRM:</strong> <strong>When he said a maester ""forges"" his chain, it is more metaphorical. They do study metals, but that doesn't necessarily
  include training as blacksmiths.</strong></p>
  
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> I had assumed the former, but the latter would be simpler. I ask, of course, because of the link of Valyrian steel in Maester
  Luwin's chain. Did he know the spells, or did he take an existing
  strip and beat it into shape?</p>
  
  <p><strong>GRRM:</strong> <strong>He studied magical tomes and histories, and mastered enough of the arcane lore to impress an archmaester into granting him
  a link.</strong> He did not necessarily have to make the steel himself.<br><sub>The Citadel - So Spake Martin: <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Maester_Chains_and_Valyrian_Steel_Links"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MAESTER CHAINS AND VALYRIAN STEEL LINKS</a></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But there can be varying interpretations. It is possible that Archmaesters could commission a smith to create a new link for the grant, from some deposit of Valyrian steel at the Citdael.</p>

<p>As you noted, the steel itself is very rare and the art of creating more has been lost. Older steel can be reworked but no one has been able to forge new since fall of Valyria. Also, thanks to <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/68872/edlothiad"">Edlothiad</a>, see what George says about forging Valyrian steel swords:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q: A brief question about Valyrian steel - is it the metal that makes
  the sword so special (provenance, age, etc), or is it the forging
  (spells, techniques)</p>
  
  <p>GRRM: Forging techniques and spells, actually. <strong>There is magic
  involved in the making of Valyrian steel.</strong></p>
  
  <p>Q: In other words, <strong>if a smith knew how, could he take some fresh,
  high-quality steel and produce an equally fine sword?</strong></p>
  
  <p>GRRM: <strong>Not unless he could work the magic.</strong></p>
  
  <p>Q: Or <strong>is it something like Aragorn's Anduril in the Lord of the
  Rings, which could be re-forged but not made from scratch</strong>, or so it
  seemed to me.</p>
  
  <p>GRRM: <strong>That's pretty much been the situation since the Doom of
  Valyria.</strong><br><sub>The Citadel - So Spake Martin: <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1153/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PRODUCING VALYRIAN STEEL</a></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q: I hope all goes well with you and this finds you in good health. I
  was just wondering if you could settle something for me in relation to
  Valyrian steel and I I [sic] just wondering if I have taken you up
  correctly on the matter. <strong>I belive I'm right in saying it differs
  from say Mithril (from LOTR) in that it is not a material which in
  itself bears advantageous properties but rather ordinary steel which
  has been subjected to a process</strong> (the physical manipulation of the
  steel combined with spells) which embues it with the desired elements.</p>
  
  <p>GRRM: <strong>Yes, that is correct</strong>. You don't mine Valyrian steel
  (actually, you don't mine any steel), you make it.</p>
  
  <p>Q: What I'm less sure of is <strong>whether Valyrian steel ever exists as a
  raw</strong> material.</p>
  
  <p>GRRM: <strong>It does not.</strong></p>
  
  <p>Q: I believe it doesn't but only as a finished blade, what <strong>I mean is
  that it is the actual process of making the sword from run of the mill
  steel which gives us a Valyrian weapon rather than Valyrian steel
  being made beforehand</strong> and then this product being used to make an
  item.</p>
  
  <p>GRRM: The closest real life analog is Damascus steel, but <strong>Valyrian
  steel is a fantasy metal. Which means it has magical characteristics,
  and magic plays a role in its forging.</strong><br><sub>The Citadel - So Spake Martin: <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Category/C91./P525"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">THE PROCESS OF MAKING VALYRIAN STEEL</a></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it seems clear that the art of creating new Valyrian Steel weapons from the scratch has been lost since the Fall of Valyria but old ones can be reworked.</p>

<p>Given that, The whole process of the link-award is feasible only if the links return to the Citadel on the awardee Maester's death or expulsion. Given that Maesters do not surrender their chains to anyone while they live (unless expelled by the order) and Samwell took Aemon's chain back to the Citadel, that seems likely.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The captain wanted Aemon’s chain as well, but there Sam had refused. It was a great shame for any maester to surrender his chain</strong>, he had
  explained. Xhondo had to go over that part three times before Quhuru
  Mo accepted it. By the time the dealing was done, Sam was down to his
  boots and blacks and smallclothes, and the broken horn Jon Snow had
  found on the Fist of First Men. I had no choice, he told himself.<br><sub>AFFC - Chapter 35</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But that is my own speculation, there's nothing in canon to suggest that it works that way. We will know soon enough, we have just started learning about the Citadel after all. Sam's sojourn there will teach us a lot about their way of life.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Why would Citadel hand over their rare links to other people to make weapons? It's their property. We don't even know how many links do the Citadel have? Do they even have enough to make a sword? We only know two Maesters who have those links. If they had enough links, why didn't any Targaryen monarch ask them to hand them over when Blackfyre was lost? Why didn't the Lannisters make some ludicrous offer, specially as Tywin is known to have made generous offers to impoverished houses with Valyrian swords?</p>

<p>So in conclusion:</p>

<ol>
<li>There might not be ""unused"" Valyrian steel at the Citadel. </li>
<li>Even if there is, New Valyrian Steel weapons cannot be created as the art is lost so there is really no point in procuring the links from the Citadel.</li>
<li>The Maesters do not work the steel. </li>
<li>The links presumably return to the Citadel on Maester's demise or expulsion. </li>
<li>There is no indication if there are even enough links at the Citadel to forge a longsword. We only know two Maesters who have such a link, Marwyn and Luwin.</li>
<li>The Citadel would have to be utter fools to sell the rare resources to bidders. They like to horde their treasures. </li>
<li>Given the continued patronage and protection of mighty Hightowers, They can easily defy other Lords who might demand them to hand over the links.</li>

<p>Drawing partly from my answer to <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/109798/do-lands-other-than-westeros-suffer-from-long-winters-and-live-under-the-threat/109813#109813"">Do lands other than Westeros suffer from long Winters and live under the threat of Others?</a>, Westeros extends further north than other known continents. Here's a low res version of the latest official map. The landmass on the left is Westeros, the much larger land mass on the right is Essos where the free cities are. The Wall is across where the completely white section (&quot;<a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Land_of_Always_Winter"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Lands of Always Winter</a>&quot; and, closer to the Wall, the various lands where the wildlings live) joins the pale white section (The North):</p>

<p>As you can see, there's nothing but sea and tiny ice islands north of Essos. There's that one island, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ibben"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ibben</a>, populated by Neanderthal-esque hairy humanoids who hunt whales, but it's not as far north as Winterfell.</p>
<p>As for north of the Wall in Westeros, you have:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Haunted_forest"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Haunted Forest</a>, which runs up to the wall and is where most of the Wildlings live</li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Frostfangs"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Frostfangs</a>, the mountain range further northwest where Mance took the wildlings and where Jon Snow joined them</li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Thenn_(region)"" rel=""noreferrer"">Thenn</a>, due North of the Haunted Forest, where the Thenns live - the closest thing to an organised nation north of the Wall.</li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Skagos"" rel=""noreferrer"">Skagos</a>, a little-known island just off the East of the Wall, rumoured to be full of cannibals and unicorns...</li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Land_of_Always_Winter"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Lands of Always Winter</a>, the white icy wastes beyond Thenn and the Frostfangs - unknown, uncharted, unexplored, described in a dream of Bran's as:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>the dead plains where nothing grew or lived</p>
<p><sub>A Game of Thrones, Bran III</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beyond that, off the top of the map, the only clue I'm aware of is from the same dream of Bran's:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the curtain of light at the end of the world, and then beyond that curtain. He looked deep into the heart of winter, and then he cried out, afraid.</p>
<p><sub>ibid</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doesn't sound very nice.</p>
<hr />
<p>That's everything north of the Wall, which is what the question seemed to be asking for.</p>
<p>There's also plenty of interesting other lands south and east (no mention of anything to the west). The premise is similar to Medieval Europe - people in Westeros are aware of other, exotic, distant lands, and occasionally encounter people from them, but don't know much about them. Check out:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Summer_Isles"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Summer Isles</a> south of Westeros. We meet a few summer islanders - extravagantly dressed, black skin, with a progressive and relaxed attitude to love, and the world's fastest, most technologically advanced ships. I suspect these are based on a mix of African trading kingdoms like the Ashanti, and early Pacific Islanders; possibly with a little Carthage too.</li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Yi_Ti"" rel=""noreferrer"">Yi Ti</a>, an advanced, once-great empire to the far east with technology including telescopes. Seems to be loosely based on medieval perceptions of China and is highly regarded - wine from here is talked about as a valuable luxury, and in Qarth when Xaro Xhoan Daxos tried to convince Dany to go with him, one of the desirables he promised was a honeymoon tour of Yi Ti on a pleasure barge.</li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Shadow_Lands"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Shadow Lands</a>, mysterious, dangerous wastes beyond Yi Ti, and <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Asshai"" rel=""noreferrer"">Asshai</a>, a mysterious city on the border, where Melissandre and Qaithe come from.</li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Sothoryos"" rel=""noreferrer"">Sothoryos</a>, the continent south of Essos. Little is known about it but the general impression is &quot;a large continent, covered in jungles, plague-ridden, and largely unexplored&quot;. <a href=""http://www.vulture.com/2014/11/george-rr-martin-new-book.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">GRRM's said</a> it's based loosely on medieval European perceptions of sub-saharan Africa - somewhere unknown and largely unexplored due to the fear of diseases like malaria.</li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ulthos"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ulthos</a>, south of the Shadowlands, and the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bone_Mountains"" rel=""noreferrer"">Bone Mountains</a> on the Eastern edge of Essos, exist but aren't even mentioned in the books. Apparently GRRM has confirmed they exist largely as an indication that the &quot;Known world&quot; isn't the whole world.</li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Sunset_Sea"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Sunset Sea</a>, west of Westeros. Like the Atlantic in medieval Europe, there's speculation that there might be land the other side (and an Iron Islander proposed an expedition), but nothing is known.</li>

"181999","Who destroyed the Sept in Lordsport, Iron Islands?","<p>The Citadel Concordance <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/Concordance/Section/2.2.6./"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">says</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sept of Lordsport was also destroyed by Robert Baratheon's forces,
  but unlike the stronghold of the Botleys and the village it was never
  rebuilt</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This squarely lays the blame on Robert's forces (Which is curious, given that the bulk of the Royal Forces were followers of the Seven, but that's not the point of the question.)</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lordsport#History"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ASOIAF wiki</a> makes no mention of the forces responsible:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During Greyjoy's Rebellion, Lordsport and its timber and wattle keep
  were the first places on Pyke to fall when King Robert I Baratheon and
  his forces landed on the island. The keep and the village were razed
  and the sept was burned to the ground.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The cited chapter itself does not make any mention of who destroyed the sept:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When last he’d seen Lordsport, it had been a smoking wasteland, the
  skeletons of burnt longships and smashed galleys littering the stony
  shore like the bones of dead leviathans, the houses no more than
  broken walls and cold ashes. After ten years, few traces of the war
  remained. The smallfolk had built new hovels with the stones of the
  old, and cut fresh sod for their roofs. A new inn had risen beside the
  landing, twice the size of the old one, with a lower story of cut
  stone and two upper stories of timber. <strong>The sept beyond had never
  been rebuilt, though; only a seven-sided foundation remained where it
  had stood</strong>. Robert Baratheon’s fury had soured the ironmen’s taste
  for the new gods, it would seem.<br><sub><strong>ACOK - Theon I</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This only mentions that the town was burnt and the people rebuilt it, with the exception of the Sept. So why does the Citadel blame Robert's forces in no ambiguous terms?  What proof do they have that it was Robert? Given that the Faith was barely tolerated in the Isles and Balon only fanned the religious/ethnic tensions before and after the rebellion, it is entirely possible that the Ironborn may have done it themselves, to send a message of sorts that there was no place for New gods on the Isles any more.</p>

<p>Who actually burnt down the sept?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","182001","<p>As far as I can see nothing explicit has been said either way in canon material apart from the quote you link. The problem with that is it can be interpreted in one of two ways.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robert Baratheon’s fury had soured the ironmen’s taste for the new gods, it would seem.<br>
  <sub>A Clash of Kings, Theon I</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
<li>Robert's forces had burnt down the sept and the unhappy Ironborn took it as 
an opportunity not to rebuild a new one.</li>
<li>The Ironborn, already unhappy with the Faith, took their opportunity when Lordsport was burnt down and burnt the sept.</li>
</ol>

<p>The Citadel page on <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/Concordance/Entry/The_Botleys_of_Lordsport"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Botleys of Lordport</a> mentions the sept being burnt down but points no fingers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The old sept of Lordsport was destroyed in the rebellion, but it was never rebuilt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, lacking an explicit quote of who it was I think we can assume it was Robert's forces. The Citadel and the wiki both seem to assume that's the case too which strengthens the point.</p>

<p>It's worth noting though that even in today's times when a fire get's going it's very hard to stop, put that back into medieval times and it's next to impossible. Considering that the whole of Lordsport was burnt to the ground and had to be rebuilt I think it's safe to assume that Robert's forces burnt the sept whether intentionally or otherwise. If this is the case, and with the Ironborn unhappy with the Faith, it's safe to assume if the flames did catch onto the sept they probably didn't try to stop them.</p>

"115364","Why does the Golden Company raise the banners for a Targaryen?","<p>The Golden Company, as we discover in the tales of Dunk &amp; Egg, was created by exiled knight Aegor ""Bittersteel"" Rivers, the <em>legitimized bastard</em> of King Aegon IV Targaryen, after they tried to place Daemon I Blackfyre on the throne instead of the King Daeron II Targaryen.</p>

<p>Their rebellion had failed. And so the Golden Company was created by the knights and Lordlings that were exiled by Targaryens.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Now, the golden company is raising banners and fighting for another
 Targaryen (Griff aka Aegon) and support his claim for the throne.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there any in-universe explanation for this change of heart?</p>

<p>P.S.: What is also fueling my hunger for answer is the fact that the Golden Company never broke a contract. It is the reputation they maintained for so long, yet now, for Illyrio and the sake of this mission, they've easily broke their contract with Myr.</p>

<p>P.S. 2:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Daenerys recalls that when she was a girl her brother Viserys
  Targaryen once feasted with the captains of the Golden Company in the hopes
  they might take up his cause. They ate his food and heard his pleas
  and laughed at him. ""<br> 
  <sub> ~ A Dance with Dragons, Chapter 16, Daenerys III, page 210</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>P.S. 3:
When Tyrion asked Illyrio Mopatis on how he convinced the Golden Company to break contract with Myr the answer was </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Some contracts are writ in ink, and some in blood. I say no more."" <br> 
  <sub>~ A Dance with Dragons, Chapter 5, Tyrion II</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which shows that whatever task they're off to instead of the contract was something promised before and linked with a blood oath or something of the like. </p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","131317","<p><strong>Warning:</strong> This answer may contain serious spoilers for those who have not read ADWD. This is not the official position of GRRM but is derived from Canon evidence in favor of this very popular theory. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> They did not! They did it for a Blackfyre. Aegon is a Blackfyre thus Golden Company is honor bound to answer his call to arms. And no, Aegon and Jon Connington don't know that. Illyrio, Varys &amp; <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Myles_Toyne"" rel=""noreferrer"">Blackheart Toyne</a> knew that. </p>

<p>Toyne most likely instructed his successor <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Harry_Strickland"" rel=""noreferrer"">Homeless Harry Strickland</a> in this matter before his demise. Despite being a cautious and somewhat craven man, Strickland could be trusted because his family was with the GC for four generations. </p>

<p>Harry may have later revealed the plan to his officers when the time came and this is why GC officers were aware of who Aegon VI ""Targaryen"" really was and absolutely willing to obey him. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Blood Contract of Golden Company</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Some contracts are writ in ink, and <strong>some in blood</strong>. I say no more.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This quote says it all. </p>

<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Golden_Company"" rel=""noreferrer"">Golden Company</a> never broke a contract once during all their years of service. Yet suddenly they break off a profitable contract and refuse many others because a ""Targaryen"" pretender had called for them.</p>

<p>Golden Company did not care a fig about Targaryens. They spent their whole history fighting against the Targaryens. When Aerys II was killed and his heirs forced into exile, what did GC do? Did they rush to offer their allegiance to Viserys Targaryen? No, they did not. When Viserys invited them to a feast and requested their support, they laughed at him. As Dany recalls:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They ate his food and heard his pleas and laughed at him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later they claim that the plan was that Viserys would join GC with Dothraki screamers on his back. Why laugh at someone you mean to take as your king eventually? Why reject his request for aid when your plan is to help him eventually?</p>

<p>This begs the question, Who are the Golden Company bound to in Blood? The answer is, <strong><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Blackfyre"" rel=""noreferrer"">House Blackfyre</a></strong>. Golden Company was founded by exiled Blackfyre loyalists with the sole purpose of one day seating a Blackfyre on the Iron throne and take possession of their own holdings which they had lost in the failed rebellions. Why would they laugh at one undoubtable Targaryen and swear allegiance to another Targaryen whose claim of parenthood are doubtful? Because they know he is not a Targaryen even if he does not know himself. </p>

<p>Even today Golden Company's motto is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Beneath the gold, <strong><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegor_Rivers"" rel=""noreferrer"">Bittersteel</a></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which implies that beneath all the gold, Bittersteel is still alive in men of his company and so is his mission. That is the ultimate mission of GC, that is their contract written in blood of many generations who died for House Blackfyre. This is the contract which trumps everything else in the world for them.</p>

<h2>Dany's visions about a fake dragon and people cheering for it</h2>

<p>Daenerys has seen this in her visions in House of the Undying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Glowing like sunset, a red sword was raised in the hand of a blue-eyed
  king who cast no shadow. <strong>A cloth dragon swayed on poles amidst a
  cheering crowd</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Granted a dragon is still a dragon, be it black or red but our little dragon here is pretending to be a different sort of dragon, which makes him no better than a mummer's dragon. The ""Mummer's dragon"" is how Dany describes it to Jorah the Andal. Oh and fun fact, Varys was a mummer in Myr. Aegon is his dragon. Which makes him a mummer's dragon.</p>

<h2>Female Line of House Blackfyre</h2>

<p>When confronted by Tyrion, Illyrio gave away more than he would have liked:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Illyrio brushed away the objection as if it were a fly. “Black or red,
  a dragon is still a dragon. When Maelys the Monstrous died upon the
  Stepstones, it was the end of the <strong>male line of House Blackfyre</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok Fine Illyrio, Male Line is dead. Do you mean you know someone descended from <em>female line of House Blackfyre</em>?</p>

<p>Illyrio definitely knows, he married one of them after all.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Illyrio thrust his right hand up his left sleeve and drew out a silver
  locket. Inside was a painted likeness of <strong>a woman with big blue eyes
  and pale golden hair streaked by silver</strong>. “Serra. I found her in a
  Lysene pillow house and brought her home to warm my bed, but in the
  end I wed her. Me, whose first wife had been a cousin of the Prince of
  Pentos. The palace gates were closed to me thereafter, but I did not
  care. The price was small enough, for Serra.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some may argue that a lot of people in Lys have such features. But wait. Why does Illyrio show such fondness for the boy pretender? </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Good fortune,” Illyrio called after them. “Tell the boy I am sorry
  that I will not be with him for his wedding. I will rejoin you in
  Westeros. That I swear, by my sweet Serra’s hands.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why does he have so much personal interest vested in Aegon's success? </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are you quite certain that Daenerys will make good her brother’s
  promises?” “She will, or she will not.” Illyrio bit the egg in half.
  “I told you, my little friend, not all that a man does is done for
  gain. Believe as you wish, but even fat old fools like me have
  friends, and debts of affection to repay.” <strong>Liar, thought Tyrion. There</strong>
  <strong>is something in this venture worth more to you than coin or castles.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why did he have chests full of rich clothes for a young boy at home which he used to dress Tyrion? Why did he have a statue which looks a lot Like Aegon at his manse?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>A naked boy stood on the water, poised to duel with a bravo’s blade in hand. He was lithe and handsome, no older than sixteen, with
  straight blond hair that brushed his shoulders.</strong> So lifelike did he
  seem that it took the dwarf a long moment to realize he was made of
  painted marble, though his sword shimmered like true steel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Could it be that the boy is actually Illyrio and Serra's son? Illyrio claims that the statue is actually his own from his youth. If the claim is true, then it is possible that Aegon inherited his looks and physique from Illyrio. If it is false, then why would someone have Aegon's statue in their manse unless they were related by blood and loved each other?</p>

<p>Illyrio was right after all when he said that ""Not everything a man does is for personal benefit"". Yup somethings are done to avenge ancestors of your wife and help your son claim his  rights. </p>

<h2>Holes in Varys' Story</h2>

<p>And we can not discount that the pretty story that Varys tells about Aegon's escape has a huge flaw. Flaw named, Aegon's death. Aegon believes that Varys smuggled him out of KL and replaced him with a common born child. It was that child whose head got squashed by Gregor Clegane which made the corpse unidentifiable. How did Varys know that Mountain will kill the boy in such a way that his corpse would not be able to be identified? Can he see the future? </p>

<p>If Mountain had not squashed the head of the child, It would have been obvious for Ser Jaime Lannister at least that the babe was not Aegon Targaryen. Ser Barristan Selmy was not present at that time otherwise he would have known as well about the fake child. Kingsguard spent their lives in presence of Royal family. It is unlikely that they would not know the child prince by sight. Pycelle would also be able to figure out that the child was not the prince since he was the grand maester and most likely saw to the birth of the prince and his later medical care. </p>

<h2>What's up with Varys?</h2>

<p>So why on Earth is Varys helping Aegon? We know the story of how Varys was cut.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With a long hooked blade, he sliced me root and stem, chanting all the
  while. I watched him burn my manly parts on a brazier. The flames
  turned blue, and I heard a voice answer his call, though I did not
  understand the words they spoke.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From Melisandre's antics we know that sorcerers use people with Royal blood to perform certain forms of magic. Why did that sorcerer choose Varys? What was so special about him? Royal Blood? Where would he get that? He can't be a lost descendant of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daemon_I_Blackfyre"" rel=""noreferrer"">Daemon I Blackfyre</a> who was son of King Aegon IV Targaryen, can he? Does Varys' hair grow a distinctive color of silver and gold which marks those with Valyrian blood in them? Oh wait, yes he is bald. How convenient! </p>

<p>Varys, is most likely, a Blackfyre. Since he is an eunuch, he can't hope to take the throne and continue house Blackfyre. Which is why he is helping a fellow blackfyre who can procreate and rule. That fellow Black dragon is our little Aegon. </p>

<p>Another theory is that Varys is brother of Serra, alleged mother of Aegon. Varys is also matrilineally descended from house Blackfyre. So he is helping his nephew Aegon take the throne which their great ancestor Daemon I Blackfyre had fought for. </p>

<h2>Meribald's rusted Red dragon</h2>

<p>There is also something that Septon Meribald said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He forged a new sign for the yard, <strong>a three-headed dragon of black
  iron</strong> that he hung from a wooden post.</p>
  
  <p>.</p>
  
  <p>.</p>
  
  <p>One of the dragon’s heads washed up on the Quiet Isle many years
  later, <strong>though by that time it was red with rust</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Three headed Black Dragon is the sigil of House Blackfyre. This could possibly be an euphemism for Aegon. A black dragon washed up across the water [Narrow sea in this case] and with time and rust [time and falsehood], it started looking red. [Red dragon is sigil of House Targaryen]. </p>

<h2>Why pose the rusted Black Dragon as Red Dragon?</h2>

<p>But why use the Targaryen ruse? Why not go and claim the throne as a Blackfyre? </p>

<p>Because it's been too long. Nobody in Westeros cares about Blackfyres now. The generation that knew and loved Daemon Blackfyre is long dead. For people now, they are just a part of history about which no one except the maesters care about.That is why they need Aegon to pose as a Targaryen and take this secret to their graves.</p>

<p>Aegon himself does not know his true lineage because Illyrio and Varys kept it a secret from him. What he does not know, he cannot let slip.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Aegon is still from a cadet branch of House Targaryen. People may still call him a fraud but if Daenerys takes Aegon in her arms as a nephew, no one will ever need to doubt his parentage. As Harry Strickland said in ADWD Chapter ""The Lost Lord"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""We need the girl. We need the marriage. If Daenerys accepts our
  princeling and takes him for her consort, The seven kingdoms will do
  the same"".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But What if Daenerys challenges him to claim a dragon to prove his blood? No problem, Aegon is also blood of the dragon, he can claim a dragon just as much as Daenerys can after which even Dany would not doubt his parentage. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>So in all probability, Aegon is a Blackfyre and thus Golden company is honor bound to answer his call to arms. The question however remains that do the men of the company know that? I think not. It's too sensitive sort of information to entrust common men-at-arms with. Do high officers know? They most probably do. They probably know even more than Aegon and Jon Connington do themselves. </p>

<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Myles_Toyne"" rel=""noreferrer"">Myles Toyne</a> who belonged to an old house loyal to Blackfyres made the pact to support Aegon on behalf of GC. He was an old man and had most likely fought in <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/War_of_the_Ninepenny_Kings"" rel=""noreferrer"">last Blackfyre rebellion</a> in which <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Barristan_Selmy"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ser Barristan Selmy</a> killed <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Maelys_Blackfyre"" rel=""noreferrer"">Maelys the Monstrous</a> and ended the male line of House Blackfyre. No man would be a bigger Blackfyre loyalist than him.</p>

<p>The officers had probably conferred among themselves before meeting Aegon because that is  what happened when Jon Connington announced that Aegon is son of Rhaegar Targaryen.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Silence greeted his announcement. Someone cleared his throat. One of
  the Coles refilled his wine cup from the flagon. Gorys Edoryen played
  with one of his corkscrew ringlets and murmured something in a tongue
  Griff did not know. Laswell Peake coughed, Mandrake and Lothston
  exchanged a glance. They know, Griff realized then. They have known
  all along. He turned to look at Harry Strickland. <strong>“When did you tell</strong>
  <strong>them?""</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A Wiser man would have asked <strong><em>""What did you tell them?""</em></strong>.</p>

<p>It was clear that it was Jon who was in the dark, not the captains of the Golden Company. They were already aware of who Aegon was and were acting on a plan. There was a reason that GC officers conferred among each other before receiving Jon Con and Aegon. </p>

<p>So of course when Aegon asked for Golden Company's help, This is what the stalwarts of house Blackfyre replied:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Prince Aegon"", said Tristan Rivers. ""We are your men. Is this your
  wish that we sail West instead of East?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Remember, these men who are soul of obedience in front of Aegon are the same men who mocked Viserys and laughed at him. But of course neither Aegon nor Jon Connington know about that.</p>

<p>What does reputation as Sell Swords mean when you have the chance to follow your true purpose and your true king? A chance to fulfill dreams of your forefathers? The dream of marching into Red Keep with Bittersteel's skull on top of a spear and a Blackfyre King climbing the stairs to the Iron Throne at last. The dream of getting back everything that was lost because of their loyalty to House Blackfyre. That dream is more important than any contract with Cheese Lords of Essos. </p>

<p>And What better time for fulfilling that dream than now? A Child King who is a suspected bastard with allegedly no claim sits on the Iron throne. The realm is ruined by horrific warfare. Lords and nobles are divided. There is chaos in the whole realm. What would happen when people learn that a Messiah has finally come from across the narrow sea? A Messiah who is none other than son of their beloved Prince Rhaegar &amp; the only (alleged) true heir to the throne? Someone who will restore order and bring justice and peace to realm like his noble ancestors did? </p>

<p>However, Daenerys would have suspected something odd with GC giving Targaryens their allegiance since she knows how they reacted to the request before.......... Unless of course, the Plan of Varys and Illyrio never had any place for Daenerys anyways except gaining her endorsement of Aegon's lineage. After that they would have removed Dany from Aegon's path, leaving no other rival claimants to the throne....or dragons.</p>

<p>As per <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K8DJTFUUIZvQsgnkxv3d-142SXTcmnTV4YuHsNubHjA/edit?pref=2&amp;pli=1#gid=688707816"" rel=""noreferrer"">this full list</a>, which also includes characters named in <em>The Hedge Knight</em>, <em>The Princess and the Queen</em>, and <em>The Rogue Prince</em> (bringing the total to <strong>2302</strong>).</p>

<p>Very big tip of the hat to Reddit user <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/Mynotoar"" rel=""noreferrer"">Mynotoar</a> for compiling this list!</p>

<p>Here are all the names in order of appearance (the full list contains much more detail, but no more will fit the 30,000 character limit).

"182889","Do we know the names of the Stepstones?","<p>The <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Stepstones"" rel=""noreferrer"">Stepstones</a> are a group of islands off of the east coast of Westeros. They connect The Broken Arm in Dorne to The Disputed Lands in Essos. According to The Lands of Ice and Fire two of the islands have been named as Bloodstone and Grey Gallows.</p>

<p>The island of Tyrosh is sometimes considered to be a part of the Stepstones by the common folk but isn't technically one of them.</p>

<p>Do we know the names of any of the other islands?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","182892","<h1>We Do Not Know</h1>

<p>I haven't found any information on the names of any of the other islands in the Stepstones but I have found out that George R. R. Martin once commented that he hadn't named one of the islands yet (although I haven't confirmed this it's likely this post is referring to the most south western island). If he hadn't named one of them it's likely he hadn't named more than that one too. Though the post is from 2006 it's likely he still hasn't named any of the others.</p>

  <p>I never got to ask a question during the Q&amp;A. But i sliped in a quick one during the book signings. I asked about the unmarked island near the Dorne. <strong>His answer was that it was just one of the stepstones and he hadn't even come up with an actual name for it. And it didn't have a lord as of yet.</strong> And apparently there are several more islands of simalar size that are extend further east. So now i'm not even sure it is part of westeros.<br>

<p>It's worth noting that the Stepstones are fairly recent, geographically, as they are the remnants the Land Bridge that connected Westeros with Essos.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Dornishmen boast that theirs is the oldest of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. This is true, after a fashion. Unlike the Andals, who came later, the First Men were not seafarers. They came to Westeros not on longships but afoot, over <strong>the land bridge from Essos—the remnants of which exist today only as the Stepstones and the Broken Arm of Dorne.</strong> Walking or riding, the eastern shores of Dorne would inevitably have been where they first set foot upon Westerosi soil.<br>

"182954","What region/group controls the Stepstones","<p>In a recent <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/182889/58193"">question of mine</a> I asked if we knew the names of the Stepstones. They are quite an interesting area having once been the land bridge between Westeros and Essos and since then having been involved in a few major events in Planetos history.</p>

<p>One thing I can't seem to work out is what region do they belong too? They were once a part of Westeros and Essos and are close to both depending on which island you are on. They also seem to have potentially been independent at some point but I'm not sure if they still are.</p>

<p>Do we know what region/group controls the Stepstones?</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>I am more interested in asking this from a political perspective but if there's any information from a geographical perspective I welcome that discussion too.</sup></p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","182955","<p>No state entity controls Step stones as of now. I am at work so can't find references right now, will do when I am free.</p>
<h3>Migration Era</h3>
<p>As you noted, Stepstones used to be the land bridge which connected Essos and Westeros. It is the very land bridge which the First Men used during their great Migration. So it stands to reason that along the way, some First Men clans may have chosen to settle right there instead of taking the roads further inside Westeros. We already know that Westeros at that point was devoid of any humans and was populated solely by Giants and Children of the Forest.</p>
<p>With the First Men advancing rapidly and exterminating settlements of the Children, they decided to strike back by breaking the land bridge to stem the flood of new comers using their brand of Water magic. But it was too little and too late. There were already enough First Men inside to wage war and the bridge itself wasn't broken completely, it just turned into a series of isles between the two continents, aptly named as Stepstones.</p>
<h3>Importance of the Isles</h3>
<p>The location of the Isles gave them strategic importance in the Naval &quot;Great Game&quot; of Planetos. The Isles sit right on the sealanes from Narrow Sea to Summer Sea, controlling all the trade flowing from West to East and vice versa. Which is why the Isles changed hands a number of times.</p>
<h3>Valyrian Freehold and her Daughters</h3>
<p>Valyrian Freehold, the first example, didn't show much interest in the Stepstones as they already had a naval base to control the said sealanes in the neighbouring Island of Tyrosh. After the fall of the Freehold, her daughters fought over the possession of the strategic Islands because whoever controlled them, practically controlled the trade flowing from East to West and Vice versa. Given that the Free Cities are mostly merchant cities, it was particularly important for them to gain control of the Islands. Neighboring Myr and Lys clashed a number of times for the Isles and they changed hands rapidly.</p>
<h3>Haaar! There be Pirates!</h3>
<p>Capitalising over exhaustion of the Free Cities due to inter-war and century of blood, Bands of Pirates moved in and established their control on the Isles and started making riches by looting the trading ships.</p>
<p>Of course then Essos was plagued with ambitions of Volantis to become new Valyria and the Essosi were too busy to pay attention to the Isles any more. And the Westerosi mostly stayed out of that part of the world. And then by the end of that era, Westeros was conquered by Aegon the Conqueror.</p>
<h3>Westerosi Campaigns</h3>
<p>Before the conquest, Given the nuance caused by the pirates and due to importance of the Isles, the neighbouring Westerosi realms from Stormlands and Dorne also engaged in warfare over the Isles but like the Free Cities, they too failed to make their gains permanent and Isles once again became hub of Piracy.</p>
<p>After the conquest, As raids continued from the Isles on Westerosi land and shipping, Prince Maegor (Later King Maegor) retaliated by a punitive campaign against the pirates. But he did not annex the Isles into the domain of Iron Throne.</p>
<h3>The Triarchy</h3>
<p>When the Free Cities got done with Volantis, three of them, Lys, Myr and Tyrosh united to form the Triarchy to contain Volantis in future. They looked West and invaded the Isles to end piracy. Westerosi nobles were generally in support of the actions of the Triarchy.</p>
<h3>Kingdom of Stepstones and the Narrow Sea</h3>
<p>Losing all hopes of inheriting the Iron Throne due to birth of three sons and two daughters to his elder brother King Viserys II, Prince Daemon Targaryen, with support of Westerosi Lords now disgruntled by heavy tolls imposed by the Triarchy, invaded the Isles with his band of adventurers, who like him were seeking lands and riches. Daemon crowned himself King of the Stepstones and the Narrow Sea. But now Dorne got involved because they were absolutely not going to let the Targaryens forge another Kingdom right across their shores. The tables turned when Dorne and Triarchy joined forces. Daemon, sensing the inevitable doom of his Kingdom while there were interesting prospects rising in Westeros which culminated into Dance of the Dragons, abandoned his Kingdom. But the Kingdom lived on with his followers taking the place. Five men ruled in that capacity until Dorne and Triarchy completely obliterated the Kingdom.</p>
<p>When Triarchy collapsed, another pirate claimed the title of King of the Stepstones during reign of Aegon III after the Dance of the Dragons.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>But eventually, the Kingdom collapsed once again with Pirate Lords ruling their own independent Islands. This state continues to this day however in light of the recent events, there are reports that another man has claimed the title of the King of the Step Stones. Rumors are that he might be the fugitive Admiral Aurane Waters who deserted King Tommen's navy with his newly made dromonds.</p>
<p>So in conclusion:</p>
<ol>
<li>No region has any de-jure claim on the Islands as of now except perhaps Lys and Myr but they are not interested in pressing their claims any longer.</li>
<li>The Isles are independent.</li>
<li>The population of the Isles seems to be a mix of Rhoynar (Different from their Dornish Kins as they did not join Nymeria on her way to Dorne), Westerosi and Essosi settlers, mainly pirates.</li>

"183037","Did Arthur Dayne give Dawn to the Smiling Knight?","<p>Discussing a <a href=""https://movies.stackexchange.com/questions/86223/how-is-one-deemed-worthy-to-acquire-the-greatsword-dawn/86224?noredirect=1#comment147058_86224"">recent question on M&amp;TV</a>, It occurred to me that the duel between Ser Arthur Dayne and the Smiling Knight isn't all that clear. </p>

<p>The passage says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And he'd held his own against the Smiling Knight, though it was Ser
  Arthur who slew him. What a fight that was, and what a foe. The
  Smiling Knight was a madman, cruelty and chivalry all jumbled up
  together, but he did not know the meaning of fear. And Dayne, with
  Dawn in hand . . . </p>
  
  <p><strong>The outlaw's longsword had so many notches by the end that Ser Arthur had stopped to let him fetch a new one. ""It's that white sword
  of yours I want,"" the robber knight told him as they resumed, though
  he was bleeding from a dozen wounds by then. ""Then you shall have it,
  ser,"" the Sword of the Morning replied, and made an end of it</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>The world was simpler in those days, Jaime thought, and men as well as
  swords were made of finer steel.<br><sub>ASOS - Jaime VIII</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When reading this, I always thought it meant that Arthur handed over his sword to his foe but still won. But there are those who read it as Arthur Dayne killing the Smiling Knight right there, denying his request for Dawn. My understanding is based on the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Arthur Dayne had the reputation of being the finest and most chivalrous Knight who ever lived. </li>
<li>Jaime remembers both men and their fight with admiration. It would have been very dishonourable and unchivalrous of him to mislead his opponent that he was considering his request. Jaime would have made some cynical comment about it then. Like he made about Ser Gerold Hightower on his response to Jaime on Aerys burning Rickard Stark to death and Ser Oswell Whent on his refusal to do something about protecting the Queen from savagery of the King. As he notes right after his recollection of the duel, men were made of finer steel back in those days, there is nothing fine about relying on superior quality of your sword rather than your skill. That too in face of an enemy bleeding from a dozen wounds taken from that very sword, who also happens to be more or less equally chivalrous. </li>
<li>It makes no sense for Arthur Dayne to stop the fight to allow his opponent to rearm himself if he was just going to kill him anyways. </li>
</ol>

<p>So is there any official, explicit indicator as to what really happened there? Did Arthur Dayne really give his sword to the Smiling Knight and finish the job with a new sword? Or did he just kill the robber Knight with Dawn?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","183038","<p>There are three interpretations from the quote ""Then you shall have it, ser"" and they are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Here, take it, I don't like it anymore</li>
<li>You will have to pry it from my dead body!</li>
<li>You will get it but it will be buried in your skull!</li>
</ol>

<p>Now from the initial quote alone they all appear to be equally likely. However, you need to take into the surrounding words of the quote to work out what happened. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ser Arthur had stopped to let him <strong>fetch a new one</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If he was going to give him Dawn for the rest of the duel, even as a slither of a thought, I doubt he would have told the other knight to fetch a new sword.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""It's that white sword of yours I want,"" the robber knight told him <strong>as they resumed</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Arthur told the knight he ""can have it"" they'd already resumed their fighting, I doubt they'd pause again to trade swords. This is also similar to the Tower of Joy with Ned saying ""Noh nowy tends"" (No, now it ends).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>and made an end of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the fact that Dayne killed the knight after he said he can have it I find it highly likely he was meaning it by interpretation number 3.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting if Dayne had given the knight Dawn for the rest of the fight it would highly likely have been retold in the stories. Such a big event missing from the story seems very unlikely to me. It's also worth noting that Dawn is a very superior sword to normal ones and so Dayne putting himself at a disadvantage is also unlikely.</p>

<p>As I understand it, Robb, as first born male, would inherit the titles of Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, and all the land of Winterfell to go with it. The girls, Sansa and Arya, would most likely be married to secure alliances with other powerful houses.

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","183572","<p>These were rumours and no one really knew what happened. </p>

<p>For example, Eddard, who actually was at King's Landing when (Or just a few hours later) this happened. Even he thinks of it as rumours.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unlike his brother, Ser Gregor did not live at court. He was a
  solitary man who seldom left his own lands, but for wars and tourneys.
  He had been with Lord Tywin when King's Landing fell, a new-made
  knight of seventeen years, even then distinguished by his size and his
  implacable ferocity. <strong>Some said it had been Gregor who'd dashed the
  skull of the infant prince Aegon Targaryen against a wall, and
  whispered that afterward he had raped the mother, the Dornish princess
  Elia, before putting her to the sword</strong>. These things were not said in
  Gregor's hearing.<br><sub><strong>AGOT - Eddard VII</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If even people who were there to observe the immediate aftermath of the act don't know it for sure, we can safely assume that no one did. But of course Gregor's own men must have known, his comrades too possibly who may have had the opportunity to witness the Princess' corpse. And we know that Mountain's men are prone to bragging about his rapes as they did with him raping the daughter of an innkeeper after the Hand's Tourney in front of Arya and other soldiers. So word naturally spread, which we can expect was especially fast as the rumour was about the former Queen-to-be, A Princess of Dorne and her tragic death.</p>

<p>Robert later ordered an inquiry but it was just a show, he was not going to break off his Lannister alliance, so it's not a surprise that it did not establish anything.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Wars and weddings have kept us well occupied, Prince Oberyn. <strong>I fear
  no one has yet had the time to look into murders sixteen years
  stale</strong>, dreadful as they were. We shall, of course, just as soon as
  we may. <strong>Any help that Dorne might be able to provide to restore the
  king's peace would only hasten the beginning of my lord father's
  inquiry—</strong>""</p>
  
  <p>""Dwarf,"" said the Red Viper, in a tone grown markedly less cordial,
  ""spare me your Lannister lies. Is it sheep you take us for, or fools?
  My brother is not a bloodthirsty man, but neither has he been asleep
  for sixteen years. <strong>Jon Arryn came to Sunspear the year after Robert

  Him, and a hundred more. I did not come for some mummer's show of an
  inquiry. I came for justice for Elia and her children, and I will have
  it. <strong>Starting with this lummox Gregor Clegane . . . but not, I think,

<p>Here, as you can notice, Tyrion does not mention the rape when he speaks of a new inquiry, neither does Oberyn. Elia and her children being murdered was undisputed, the rape however remained just a rumour. Oberyn still could have insisted on investigation of those charges as well but for some reason it did not happen.</p>

<p>Between themselves, when discussing the justice, Tyrion and his father talked only as if the murder charges were the only ones that Oberyn knew of for sure and even at that, he did not have any evidence as to who was the real culprit. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Very well, as you ask so pleasantly. The Red Viper is not going to be
  pleasant, I fear... nor will he content himself with Ser Gregor’s head
  alone.”</p>
  
  <p>“All the more reason not to give it to him.”</p>
  
  <p>“Not to... ?” Tyrion was shocked. “I thought we were agreed that the
  woods were full of beasts.”</p>
  
  <p>“Lesser beasts.” Lord Tywin’s fingers laced together under his chin.
  “Ser Gregor has served us well. No other knight in the realm inspires
  such terror in our enemies.”</p>
  
  <p>“<strong>Oberyn knows that Gregor was the one who</strong>...”</p>
  
  <p>“<strong>He knows nothing. He has heard tales. Stable gossip and kitchen
  calumnies. He has no crumb of proof. Ser Gregor is certainly not about
  to confess to him. I mean to keep him well away for so long as the
  Dornishmen are in King’s Landing.</strong>”</p>
  
  <p>“And when Oberyn demands the justice he’s come for?”</p>
  
  <p>“I will tell him that Ser Amory Lorch killed Elia and her children,”
  Lord Tywin said calmly. “So will you, if he asks.”</p>
  
  <p>“Ser Amory Lorch is dead,” Tyrion said flatly.</p>
  
  <p>“Precisely. Vargo Hoat had Ser Amory torn apart by a bear after the
  fall of Harrenhal. That ought to be sufficiently grisly to appease
  even Oberyn Martell.”<br><sub><strong>ASOS - Tyrion VI</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the rape did happen, Tywin Lannister, Commander of the men who did it, is confident that it happened. He however claims that he never intended to harm Elia and she should have been unharmed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>His father shrugged. “I grant you, it was done too brutally. <strong>Elia
  need not have been harmed at all, that was sheer folly. By herself she
  was nothing</strong>.”</p>
  
  <p>“Then why did the Mountain kill her?”</p>
  
  <p>“Because I did not tell him to spare her. I doubt I mentioned her at
  all. I had more pressing concerns. Ned Stark’s van was rushing south
  from the Trident, and I feared it might come to swords between us. And
  it was in Aerys to murder Jaime, with no more cause than spite. That
  was the thing I feared most. That, and what Jaime himself might do.”
  He closed a fist. “Nor did I yet grasp what I had in Gregor Clegane,
  only that he was huge and terrible in battle. <strong>The rape... even you
  will not accuse me of giving that command, I would hope.</strong> Ser Amory
  was almost as bestial with Rhaenys. I asked him afterward why it had
  required half a hundred thrusts to kill a girl of... two? Three? He
  said she’d kicked him and would not stop screaming. If Lorch had
  halfthe wits the gods gave a turnip, he would have calmed her with a
  few sweet words and used a soft silk pillow.” His mouth twisted in
  distaste. “The blood was in him.”<br><sub><strong>ASOS - Tyrion VI</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But later, Tyrion admitted in front of Oberyn that the rape did happen and who was the rapist, confirming his doubts. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""How sad for him,"" said the Red Viper. ""And for you. Do all noseless
  men lie so badly, I wonder?""</p>
  
  <p>""I am not lying. Ser Amory dragged Princess Rhaenys out from under her
  father's bed and stabbed her to death. He had some men-at-arms with
  him, but I do not know their names."" He leaned forward. ""<strong>It was Ser
  Gregor Clegane who smashed Prince Aegon's head against a wall and
  raped your sister Elia with his blood and brains still on his
  hands</strong>.""</p>
  
  <p>""<strong>What is this, now? Truth, from a Lannister</strong>?"" Oberyn smiled
  coldly. ""Your father gave the commands, yes?""<br><sub><strong>ASOS - Tyrion IX</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So by the time Oberyn met Gregor, he was certain and he needed only Gregor's confession, which he did receive. </p>

<p>In Conclusion:</p>

<ol>
<li>There were only rumours. </li>
<li>Lannisters believed Martells had no proof.</li>
<li>Rape did happen. </li>
<li>By the time Oberyn met Gregor in combat, he was certain about the rape and that Gregor had done it, thanks to Tyrion.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>grrm</em></strong>: I suspect that ""Maegor III"" was a mistake, though I cannot say for certain. Perhaps a flubbed line, as you suggest. It is true that the Targaryen succession on the series is different than the one in the novels; <strong>most notably, the Mad King's father Jaehaerys II was dropped, as was established way back in season one.</strong> In much the same way as the Rhoynar have been dropped from the royal titles, ""King of Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men,"" etc.<br>
  <strong>These changes were simplifications, however.</strong> The books are very complex, but the practical limits of a television series call for a bit more simplicity. Dropping a king or two accomplishes that.</p>

The Wiki can't draw a full Targaryen family tree until we know that"" and his simple answer was <strong>""yes, Jaehaerys II has been removed""</strong>. Ack.

<blockquote>
<p>Roose Bolton removed a ragged strip of leather from the pouch at his belt. &quot;My son sent this with his letter.&quot;</p>

"49923","Why does Magister Illyrio have slaves if they're not allowed in Pentos?","<p>In <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, Daenerys mentions that slavery didn't exist in Pentos, yet, the women who were going to bathe her were Illyrio's slaves.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There came a soft knock on her door.</p>
  
  <p>""Come,"" Dany said, turning away from the window. Illyrio's servants
  entered, bowed, and set about their business.</p>
  
  <p>They were slaves, a gift from one of the magister's many Dothraki
  friends. There was no slavery in the free city of Pentos. Nonetheless,
  they were slaves.</p>
  
  <p>The old woman, small and grey as a mouse, never said a word, but the
  girl made up for it. She was Illyrio's favorite, a fair-haired,
  blue-eyed wench of sixteen who chattered constantly as she worked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it mentioned if he is at risk of being caught or punished for having the slaves?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","49935","<p>Politics and money.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: if you have not completed the series, SPOILER ALERT.</strong></p>

<p>First, politics: Illyrio's refusal to bow to the law of Pentos is symbolic of his character. He believes himself above those laws. Second, money: Illyrio is probably a slave trader, so the household slaves aren't necessarily the extent of his slaveholdings.</p>

<p>The matter is revisited twice in <em>A Dance With Dragons</em>. First, in chapter 2:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Slaves?"" the dwarf asked pointedly.
  The fat man stroked one of the prongs of his oiled yellow beard, a gesture Tyrion found remarkably obscene. ""Slavery is forbidden in Pentos, by the terms of the treaty the Braavosi imposed on us a hundred years ago. Still, they will not refuse you.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Illyrio is allied with the Targaryens, and believes that their rule is the future. In other words, he believes that he is bigger than Pentos. Further, pointing out that the law comes from Braavos, not from Pentos, implies that the law is unnatural to Pentos. That then is justification for ignoring it.</p>

<p>Illyrio's relationship with slavery is expanded on in chapter 5:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tyrion pondered all that he knew of Volantis, oldest and proudest of
  the Nine Free Cities. Something was awry here. Even with half a nose,
  he could smell it. ""It's said that there are five slaves for every
  free man in Volantis. Why would the triarchs assist a queen who
  smashed the slave trade?"" He pointed at Illyrio. ""For that matter, why
  would you? <strong>Slavery may be forbidden by the laws of Pentos, yet you
  have a finger in that trade as well, and maybe a whole hand</strong>. And yet
  you conspire for the dragon queen, and not against her. Why? What do
  you hope to gain from Queen Daenerys?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Emphasis added)</p>

<p>Illyrio responds with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The Beggar King swore that I should be his master of coin, and a
  lordly lord as well. Once he wore his golden crown, I should have my
  choice of castles... even Casterly Rock, if I desired. [...] My manse
  is large enough for any man, and more comfortable than your drafty
  Westerosi castles. Master of coin, though...""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This exchange reveals why Illyrio is helping the Targaryens. It also, however, reveals that Illyrio is not only a slaveholder, but also probably a slave <em>trader</em>. It is, then, a source of his wealth - and as the passage just illustrated, Illyrio will go very far, and take many risks, for money. Even defying Pentos law.</p>

<p>In answer to your second question, no: the danger/consequences of discovery are never mentioned. This supports the reader's impression of Illyrio as a powerful man, to have no concern about breaking the law.</p>

"49949","Why wasn't Ned Stark king instead of Robert Baratheon?","<p>I haven't read the books yet, but my question is why wasn't Ned Stark king instead of Robert Baratheon? Was it because House Baratheon was more powerful than House Stark?</p>

<p>How could Ned trust him? I mean, in the books he is pretty much free in Winterfell to do anything he likes. </p>

<p>Could Ned not suspect that he might want revenge or something from the Starks?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","50009","<p>The idea was to raise Theon as a member of the Stark family, so that he would come to understand and respect the ways of Winterfell. That included allowing him to ride around the woods and handle weapons. This was common practice with ancient and medieval hostage taking. From <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage</a> :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The practice of taking hostages is very ancient, and has been used
  constantly in negotiations with conquered nations, and in cases such
  as surrenders, armistices and the like, where the two belligerents
  depended for its proper carrying out on each other's good faith. The
  Romans were accustomed to take the sons of tributary princes and
  educate them at Rome, thus holding a security for the continued
  loyalty of the conquered nation and also instilling a possible future
  ruler with ideas of Roman civilization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Theon <em>could</em> have tried to kill Eddard or one of the Stark children to avenge his brothers. But if he did so, he would probably be hunted down by the surviving Starks or their bannermen. It's a very long way from Winterfell to the Iron Islands; Theon's chances of making the journey as a fugitive who was wanted for murdering a Stark would be rather slim. </p>

<p>Not only that, he would have dishonoured his father and likely provoked a war between the Iron Islands and the rest of the Seven Kingdoms -- a war which, prior to the death of Robert Baratheon, the Iron Islands would almost certainly lose. So he would have been less than welcome if he reached the Iron Islands. Theon knew all this, and in any event he seems to have liked and respected Eddard and his children, having been taken to Winterfell at a very young age.</p>

<p>Finally, there is no indication in the books that Eddard fully trusted Theon. Eddard was never alone with Theon, and he didn't send Theon far away from Winterfell, much less order him to visit the Iron Islands. As Thundergr points out, that was Robb's mistake.</p>

<p>What indications or evidence, if any, are provided in the books so far that this will be Sansa, the source of her undoing, rather than Margaery Tyrell or Daenerys Targaryen who may seem more obvious choices?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","116739","<p><strong>Summary</strong>: All three meet the criteria equally well, in terms of description, motivation, and means. There are two other possible candidates too, but they look pretty unlikely. Margaery and Sansa are, arguably, making similar amounts of progress towards actually <em>achieving</em> the prophecy, with Margaery in the lead (Dany needs to really raise her game here). There aren't any obvious clues from other prophecies. I'd personally edge Sansa over Marge as the most likely candidate, purely because it seems like more of a GRRM-esque twist; but it's too close to call.</p>

<hr>

<p>They all have the right <strong>motivation</strong>, they all have (or, are on course to have) an <strong>army</strong> and powerful backers capable of casting down Cersei, they all are (or, are on course to be) some kind of <strong>queen</strong> (I'd say this requirement is strongly implied in ""Queen you shall be... until there comes another""; but it's debatable), and they are all described as young and beautiful:</p>

<p><sub>Spoiler tags contain summaries of differences on where they each are in the TV show. According to <a href=""http://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewtopic.php?f=67&amp;t=17753"" rel=""nofollow"">this transcript</a>, the TV show wording is almost the same: <em>""You'll be queen. For a time. Then comes another, younger, more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold dear""</em></sub></p>

<ul>
<li>Sansa has <strong>motivation</strong> (avenging her family) and is getting an <strong>army</strong> and powerful backers (the knights of the vale, thanks to Baelish's plotting). It's easy to see how she could become a <strong>queen</strong> (""Queen of the North"", if Baelish's plan to use her to take Winterfell is a success), and she's described as young and beautiful.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> In the TV show: she's kinda in the same position, assuming she continues her escape. Baelish has manipulated the knights of the Vale into wanting to support Sansa, and has secured a royal decree to take them North to take Winterfell, on Sansa's behalf.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Margaery has <strong>motivation</strong> (personal ambition and rivalry) and has an <strong>army</strong> and powerful backers (the Tyrells are among the most powerful families, with many potential allies). She's already a <strong>queen</strong>, and she's described as young and beautiful.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> In the TV show: I think she's in a similar position, assuming she can talk her way out of the tricky situation with the Sparrows (seems likely)</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>Daenerys has <strong>motivation</strong> (considers herself rightful queen of Westeros and the Lannisters treacherous usurpers) and... kinda probably has one or more <strong>armies</strong> (new dothraki? unsullied if she can re-unite with them?) and powerful backers (Illyrio and chums, various sellsword companies, and let's call her dragons backers). She already calls herself a <strong>queen</strong>, and she's described as young and beautiful.</p>

<p>This is all assuming she doesn't just die of cholera on some hillside (don't do it GRRM, seriously! Yes, I know it would be a brave move and unpredictable...)</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> In the TV show: She's in the same situation - it all hinges on whether the giant dragon is impressive enough for her to convince these dothraki to follow her.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So they're all pretty much precisely equal on this front. Almost like the author planned it this way... </p>

<p>Since they're all possibilities, from here it's just future events, to which the only relevant clue is prophetic visions. I don't think any of Dany's, Melisandre's or Bran's are obviously relevant - the closest I can think of is the throne room covered in snow - but that could mean any number of things.</p>

<hr>

<p>Those are the obvious three candidates. There are also two possible ""surprise"" candidates:</p>

<ul>
<li>Val, Mance Rayder's sister-in-law, has <strong>motivation</strong> (she's smart, uncompromising, ambitious, wants the wildlings to sweep south). Assuming Castle Black goes to chaos, she's in the best position to unite whatever's left of the wildlings, Jon Snow in whatever form he might have, and whatever's left of Stannis's faction (who consider her a ""princess"" and who Stannis tried to use to build alliances) - which could give her an <strong>army</strong> - and Melisandre is potentially a powerful backer. If Mance is dead, then according to the logic of Stannis's backers, she's <strong>Queen</strong> of the Wildlings, and she's described as young and beautiful.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> In the TV show: she doesn't exist. Bit of an obstacle. But they've parachuted in characters at the last minute before (e.g. Ser Dontas, and it sounds like they're doing the same with the Iron Islanders next series)</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Arianne Martell, princess of Dorne, has <strong>motivation</strong> (she's already been involved in one conspiracy to stoke war), has an <strong>army</strong> (Dorne) and powerful backers (with Quentin's plot failed, it'd be natural for her to ally with - possible by marriage - Young Griff and company). This would make her arguably a <strong>queen</strong>, and she's described as young and beautiful.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> In the TV show: she doesn't exist, and it seems impossible to parachute her in: we've met Doran Martell and there was nothing to suggest he has a daughter. So, seems unlikely.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I also briefly considered Asha Greyjoy, who has the motivation and could conceivably end up becoming a reaving Queen of the Iron Islands - but there's nothing to suggest she's <em>more</em> beautiful than Cersei, and the manoeuvring it'd take to get her in a suitable position would take another 5 books...</p>

<p>One more fun possibility, especially if we're not strict about the ""queen"" part:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Arya, wearing a beautiful young woman's face. Disguising herself as Taena Merryweather would make for an easy assassination, for example... This also gives us the fun possibility of her <em>literally</em> taking all that Cersei holds dear, via Jaqen/Pate style identity theft.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>There's just one more thing to differentiate them: how many steps they've taken towards achieving the prophecy already. </p>

<p>Things Cersei holds dear:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Her children:</strong>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Joffrey.</em></strong> Marge was involved in this plot, whether she knew it or not. Sansa was indirectly involved. Too late for anyone else, probably (<em>maybe</em> Arianne was involved in supplying the poison somehow, with Baelish opportunistically ensuring Dorne also owed him a favour... seems needlessly complicated, even for ASOIAF!).</li>
<li><strong><em>Tommen.</em></strong> Marge is doing a good job of weaning the lad away from his mother, but hasn't finished the job.</li>
<li><strong><em>Myrcella.</em></strong> Arianne has certainly complicated things here, but hasn't finished the job. I can't think of any way Sansa or Marge could have been a factor in Tyrion sending her away to Dorne.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Her power.</strong> The Tyrells and particularly Marge have been working on separating this from her for a long time.</li>
<li><strong>Her dignity.</strong> Cersei arguably lost this as a result of her failed scheming against Margaery.</li>
<li><strong>Jaime.</strong> Arguably, Sansa is a factor in him leaving King's Landing and re-thinking his life (via his promise). Brienne ""the beauty"" might be about to finish this job (in one of at least three possible ways), but I think she misses too many of the main criteria to be a candidate.</li>
</ul>

<p>So if we take the prophecy very literally, I'd say this suggests the candidates could be narrowed to Sansa and Margaery: </p>

<ul>
<li>For it to be <strong>Sansa</strong>, she needs to somehow do something about Tommen and Myrcella, and then destroy Cersei's power and standing for good. Possible (though it's hard to see how or why she'd separate Cersei from Tommen and Myrcella). </li>
<li>For it to be <strong>Marge</strong>, she needs to do something about Myrcella and Jaime, then continue what she's doing. Very possible: Jaime's starting to become a capable threat, and Marge seems ambitious enough that, if Myrcella became any kind of rival somehow (maybe if Tommen looked likely to die before giving her a half-Tyrell heir?), she might do whatever was necessary. Not necessarily killing: could be, arranging for her to be exiled, manipulating her into unwisely eloping, contriving some scandal, etc etc.</li>
<li>The others are lagging way behind. If Arianne in any way helped procure Joffrey's poison, she could be a surprise challenger, but she'd need to get busy. For Dany, her only (indirect) influence on Cersei so far actually arguably helped her (Ned and Rob falling out over whether to send an assassin).</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>I'm aware of only one real-life clue - GRRM has said repeatedly that he works very hard to make his writing unpredictable. This is may be a small nudge in favour of Sansa over Dany and Marge, but it's only a small nudge:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cersei seems to believe that it's Marge, and her point-of-view leads readers down this path. Main characters misleading readers about how to read a prophecy is a pretty common GRRM trick.</li>
<li>Daenerys is the obvious alternative candidate, and GRRM's been toying with leading readers to expect her to retake Westeros any book now for the whole series.</li>
<li>There's no overt clues to prompt a reader to think of Sansa (with the possible exception of the vision of the throne room covered in snow, but there are hundreds of possible interpretations of this). In fact, Cersei has always viewed Sansa as harmless and easily manipulated. She'd therefore be a good surprise twist.</li>

"50235","What was Littlefinger's motivation for the Purple Wedding?","<p>As realized in the second half of A Storm of Swords and early in Season 4 of the TV series, Littlefinger conspires to </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> kill Joffrey at his wedding to Margaery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Afterwards, he discusses this with Sansa:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> ""Why should I wish him dead?"" Littlefinger shrugged. ""I had no motive ... Sometimes the best way to baffle [your foes] is to make moves that have no purpose, or even seem to work against you.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But is Littlefinger being entirely truthful? Surely he had some motivation for the plot, beyond just confusing his opponents?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","50274","<p>It's very hard to come up with why Littlefinger does anything, since he's very private with his true intentions. All we can come up with are a few guesses. As I see it, there are only two reasons Littlefinger might do anything: to advance his power and political position, and for pure personal reasons.</p>

<h2>Political Agenda</h2>

<p>Littlefinger lost the hand of the love of his life because his name had no power behind it, and ever since he has been working hard to change that. In the span of 15 years or so, he went from the son of an impoverished lord to the Master of Coin of Westeros, Lord Paramount of the Trident, the Lord Protector of the Vale and Lord of Harrenhal. And it's quite obvious he doesn't have plans to stop. </p>

<p>Assassinating Joffrey accomplished several things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Removed Joffrey, who was by all accounts hard to control. In his place is now young Tommen, who has no real power of his own yet. Making the throne much easier to influence.</li>
<li>Get the favor of Tyrells who now wield great power in the council through Mace Tyrell, the Kingsguard through Loras Tyrell, and the throne itself through Queen Margaery. </li>
<li>Gained control of Sansa Stark, who is (as far as everyone knows) the heir to the North. Now if Littlefinger's scheme of marrying Harry the Heir to Sansa works, he will gain control of the North and the Vale.</li>
</ul>

<p>So through all these machinations Littlefinger can potentially control the North, the Vale and the Riverlands, as well as having considerable influence with the Tyrells who control the South and are largely the power behind the Iron Throne (now that Tywin and Cersie have been neutralized). So one can argue that Littlefinger is now, or is going to be, one of the most powerful men in Westeros if not <em>the</em> most powerful. </p>

<h2>Personal Agenda</h2>

<p>Here it is pure speculation, since we have no insight on how Littlefinger thinks. I can't think of Littlefinger having any daggers to hone with Joffrey. However, we do know he still retained his love for Cat, and he thinks she was killed by the Lannisters. </p>

<p>More likely, I think, is that Littlefinger harbors a grudge with <em>all</em> the Great Houses. After all, he lost Cat to the heir of House Stark. But even with House Stark all but extinguished, his machinations continue. Which hints that his revenge plot (if it does indeed exist) encompasses all the families that have looked down on him in the past.</p>

"116417","How do bastards name their children?","<p>If a bastard has a child from marriage. What would be the child's surname? If it was their fathers it would be confusing and probably most 'natural names' would be held by legitimately born children.</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><names>","116421","<p>For lack of tangible proof of ""rules"" of naming (at least so far), I am going to resort to examples to try to answer this question:  </p>

<p><strong>Case 1:</strong> The bastard is female, and marries a nobleman. </p>

<p>The female takes the man's name (if she chooses) and so the children take the man's name.<br>
(currently seeking an example of this, closest case is Raynald Westerling
promised wedding to a Lannister bastard, however the marriage didn't occur because, well Raynald died.)</p>

<p><strong>Case 2:</strong> The bastard is male, and marries a highborn woman.</p>

<p>The children take the father's name, which would be the regional bastard name.<br>
This can be illustrated by the case of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Walder_Rivers"" rel=""noreferrer"">Walder Rivers</a>, who married a Charlton noblewoman - his children Aemon and Walda both remained Rivers.<br>
Despite keeping the bastard name, they may be intent on maintaining reminders of their noble status - for instance, Walder Rivers has his own variation of the Frey coat of arms.</p>

<p><strong>Case 3:</strong> A noble bastard marries a lowborn.</p>

<p>Now if a noble's bastard marries a non-noble, their children still have bastard names even though technically they aren't bastards. The inheritance of the bastard name is an indication that they are both of noble lineage, but not in line to inherit in any way.<br>
This is the case with <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aemon_Rivers"" rel=""noreferrer"">Aemon Rivers</a>.</p>

<p>In cases 2 and 3, the legitimate children may choose to alter their surname to reflect their legitimate status.
For example, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Longwaters"" rel=""noreferrer"">House Longwaters</a> is descended from Jon Waters, a Targaryen bastard. Jon Waters' legitimate son changed his surname from the inherited bastard name Waters to Longwaters.</p>

<p><strong>Case 4:</strong> Lowborn bastard marries a lowborn.</p>

<p>Generally, lowborn folk don't even bother with surnames.<br>
For example, Ser Duncan the Tall doesn't even know his own name (although his example is a bit extreme).<br>
But some don't bother, because it doesn't mean anything anyway, so either they take a name of their choosing or not. </p>

<p>P.S.: All the bastards in question here are have obviously not been legitimized.</p>

<p>Given that Littlefinger has never openly acknowledged Daenerys as a player in the Game of Thrones, who are the three queens that Littlefinger is referring to?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","50284","<p>The first two queens are quite obvious of course. Queen Margaery and Queen Mother Cersei. The third is a bit problematic, but we have a few candidates:</p>

<li><p><strong>Asha Greyjoy</strong>, who has crowned herself queen of the Iron Isles. She has no real power and a heavily contested title, but it could be her that Littlefinger means.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Myrcella Baratheon</strong>. The most likely candidate. As a claimant to the Iron Throne, and backed by the spears of House Martell, she is a viable threat. Though how Littlefinger would know about this is problematic.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sansa Stark</strong>. As far as everyone knows, she is the heir to the kingdom of the North. But as of now she still has no real power, so I think it's unlikely it was her Littlefinger meant.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Selyse Florent</strong>. Rather unlikely. While her husband King Stannis remains a threat (a minor one), she wields little to no influence on him.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jeyne Westerling</strong>. Very unlikely. King Robb is dead, however, his cause in tatters and the Westerlings proven complicit in his fall. So I find it unlikely that she was whom Littlefinger was talking about.</p></li>

<p>Given what we know today (prior to the release of TWOW), did Roose Bolton blunder in sending out a large portion of his forces, or was it a tactical necessity given the deteriorating situation of the men under his command?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","50412","<p>Did he blunder? Perhaps, we don't know how his call-to-arms went until the next book. However, it is fairly easy to imagine how things could have gone indefinitely worse if they had simply remained where they are.</p>

<p>Secondly, Bolton can't risk himself getting caught in a siege. Despite the fact that he has the alliance of several Northern families, his grip on them is less than stunning. Most of them only do as they are told because their family is held hostage. If Stannis is allowed to set up a blockade, Bolton will have a difficult time getting supplies, where as Stannis will most likely gain the support from more northern tribes.</p>

<p>The first two points pretty much forced his hand, but then there's a third part and quite possibly the most important reason as to why Bolton decided to switch for an attack, he got <em>overconfident</em>. It had been snowing and storming for days on end and as several men pointed out, Stannis would likely be vulnerable, hungry, cold and disorientated, unable to see their enemy approaching. Bolton figured that rather than wait and risk morale dropping even further, he'd be able to go out and crush Stannis.</p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","52603","<p>As there have not been (as of A Dance With Dragons) any Roose PoV chapters or any chapter where he talked about this battle, we may only speculate on his reasoning.</p>

<p>Regarding this specific battle, we can see two interesting quotes from the book that show that Bolton's forces haven't suffered so much in this defeat:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He glimpsed the bull moose of the Hornwoods, the Karstark sunburst, Lord Cerwyn’s battle-axe, and the mailed fist of the Glovers ... and the twin towers of Frey. (AGOT, Tyrion VIII)</p>

  <p>“My liege, we have taken some of their commanders. Lord Cerwyn, Ser Wylis Manderly, Harrion Karstark, four Freys. Lord Hornwood is dead, and I fear Roose Bolton has escaped us.” (AGOT, Tyrion VIII)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This has not been the last time Roose Bolton's forces had separated from the remaining bannermen's, to their loss. At the Battle of Duskendale, which was Roose Bolton's idea (to which he did not commit any forces), he had similarly sacrificed the lives of his ""allies"" as opposed to his own:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Tell him to put the captives to the sword and the castle to the torch, by command of the king. Then he is to join forces with Robett Glover and strike east toward Duskendale. Those are rich lands, and hardly touched by the fighting. It is time they had a taste. Glover has lost a castle, and Tallhart a son. Let them take their vengeance on Duskendale.” (ACOK, Arya X)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""As for Stark, the boy is still in the west, but a large force of northmen under Helman Tallhart and Robett Glover are descending toward Duskendale. I’ve sent Lord Tarly to meet them, while Ser Gregor drives up the kingsroad to cut off their retreat. Tallhart and Glover will be caught between them, with a third of Stark’s strength.”
  “Duskendale?” There was nothing at Duskendale worth such a risk. Had the Young Wolf finally blundered? (ASOS, Tyrion I)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The result was a large defeat for the North:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The eunuch smiled a silken smile. “I have such delicious tidings for you all, my lords. Yesterday at dawn our brave Lord Randyll caught Robett Glover outside Duskendale and trapped him against the sea. Losses were heavy on both sides, but in the end our loyal men prevailed. Ser Helman Tallhart is reported dead, with a thousand others. Robett Glover leads the survivors back toward Harrenhal in bloody disarray, little dreaming he will find valiant Ser Gregor and his stalwarts athwart his path.” (ASOS, Tyrion III)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When they brought him word of the battle at Duskendale, where Lord Randyll Tarly had shattered Robett Glover and Ser Helman Tallhart, he might have been expected to rage. Instead he’d stared in dumb disbelief and said, “Duskendale, on the narrow sea? Why would they go to Duskendale?” He’d shook his head, bewildered. “A third of my foot, lost for <em>Duskendale</em>?” (ASOS, Catelyn IV)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only that, when Roose Bolton left Harrenhall to rejoin the Starks, more loyal bannermen fell:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two-thirds of my strength was on the north side when the Lannisters attacked those still waiting to cross. Norrey, Locke, and Burley men chiefly, with Ser Wylis Manderly and his White Harbor knights as rear guard. I was on the wrong side of the Trident, powerless to help them. Ser Wylis rallied our men as best he could, but Gregor Clegane attacked with heavy horse and drove them into the river. As many drowned as were cut down. More fled, and the rest were taken captive.” (ASOS, Catelyn VI)</p>

<p>The key part being that they're castrated, often at a very young age.

<p>The other clue might be the nature of the building that Daenerys was entering. If it was the chambers for a woman, or a number of women, it's more likely that the guard outside would be a eunuch. The lack of sexual urges means there's no worry about them consorting with the women at all.</p>

<p>Renly also showed that he didn't feel that the normal rules of succession were too important. He made it clear that it was strength and power that won the throne.

Clearly he felt that he would make a better king, had the army to take it, and therefore deserved the crown.</p>

<p>The song of ice and fire is a subject of a prophecy and is eponymous for the ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series of book. The song of ice and fire is said to be <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/The_prince_that_was_promised"">the prince that was promised</a>'s but <strong>the content of the actual song remains unknown</strong>.</p>

<p>At the House of the Undying, Daenerys Targaryen sees a man (Rhaegar Targaryen) and overhears him talking to a woman (Elia Martell) nursing a baby; ""Aegon… What better name for a king… He is the prince that was promised, and <strong>his is the song of ice and fire</strong>""</p>

<p>However, neither Daenerys nor Ser Jorah Mormont know what the song of ice and fire means. It is implied that there is a connection between the song, the promise, and Daenerys herself. </p>

<p>The phrase ""ice and fire"" is also mentioned in the Reeds' oath of loyalty to Bran Stark. The phrase ""ice and fire"" appears two more times in the books as an example of opposites however, the song and the promise are never mentioned again, and the song itself remains a mystery.</p>

<p>However in Norse Mythology where the word originates from, it’s Anglicized from “Vargr” to “Warg” or “Varg” (a fact backed up by research online). This is also backed up in Lord of the Rings among other things about the Warg Riders.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Alleras would make a maester. <strong>He had only been at the Citadel for a

<p>and ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Game_of_Thrones"" rel=""noreferrer"">A Game of Thrones</a>"";</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“He told me that a maester’s collar is made of chain to remind him
  that he is sworn to serve ....A maester forges his chain with study,
  he told me. <strong>The different metals are each a different kind of
  learning, gold for the study of money and accounts, silver for
  healing, iron for warcraft</strong>""<br>
  <sub>A Game of Thrones, Jon V</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In order to earn sufficient links to call oneself a 'maester', it seems likely that you would need to study as an apprentice for around 10 years but potentially up to 20 before you are awarded the title. This is borne out by the advanced ages of the vast majority of maesters seen as well as our own <em>contemporary</em> understanding of the time needed to achieve multiple doctorates.</p>

<h2>How many links are needed...</h2>

<p>From the TV series, we can see that the chains seem to contain approximately 20 links and from <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Dragon_Limbs_and_Gender_Valyrain_Weapons_and_Maesters_Chains/"" rel=""noreferrer"">a quote</a> from GRRM we know that maesters can be awarded <em>multiple</em> links of the same metal if they are especially proficient in a particular area of knowledge. This suggests that a maester never finishes learning or earning links.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>[Can a maester's chain include multiple links of the same metal?]</em><br>
  Mulitple links are possible, and signify that the maester is especially accomplished in that area.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Certain links, such as ravenry can only be awarded by an ""<em>Archmaester</em>"" whereas other links can be granted by the mutual assent of other maesters or presumably even be self-awarded.</p>

<h2>Whether some are more prestigious than others...</h2>

<p><a href=""http://wiki.westeros.org/index.php/Maesters#The_collar"" rel=""noreferrer"">Some links</a> such as Black Steel (Ravenry), Copper (History), Silver (Medicine), Pewter (unknown) and Bronze (Astronomy) seem common and relatively easy to attain since they're held by first and second-year students. Others such as Gold (Economics), Iron (Warfare) and Electrum (unknown) are particularly rare and seem to mark the passage into becoming a full-fledged Maester. </p>

<p>Valyrian Steel links (for the study of Magic + the Occult) are <em>exceedingly</em> rare and held by less than one Maester in a hundred. Ironically, they aren't seen as especially <em>prestigious</em> but rather viewed with suspicion.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Luwin slid a finger up under his collar and began to turn it, inch by inch. He had a thick neck for a small man, and the chain was tight, but a few pulls had it all the way around. ""This is Valyrian steel,"" he said when the link of dark grey metal lay against the apple of his throat. ""<strong>Only one maester in a hundred wears such a link.</strong> This signifies that I have studied what the Citadel calls the higher mysteries—magic, for want of a better word. A fascinating pursuit, but of small use, which is why so few maesters trouble themselves with it.<br>

"185223","Where do small folks' surnames come from?","<p>So, we know nobles get their surnames from their house (Stark, Greyjoy, etc), which could include commoners with names from  fallen houses (Brown Ben Plumm).   We know acknowledged bastards get a regional surname (Snow, Waters, Flowers, etc). We know that subsequent offspring of acknowledged bastards might create a hybrid surname (Longwaters, possibly Bywater). </p>

<p>In concept, I could see them coming from a craft like in real life (Miller, Tanner, etc), though I can't think of a character from the books with that kind of name. </p>

<p>What I'm curious about is where do the rest come from? Surnames like Slynt or Deem. They don't seem to fit any of the above patterns, and seems sporadically applied. Any insight into how these names came to be?  </p>

<p>Note that the other answer cannot be correct unless someone can explain how Slynt and Deem are Noble (before Janos' elevation) or Bastard names. </p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","185226","<p>The short answer to this is that the small folk do not have surnames. As George R. R. Martin says himself.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bastard names are given only to bastards with at least one parent of high birth. <strong>So the bastard child of two peasants would have no surname at all.</strong><br>
  Thus a bastard name like ""Snow"" or ""Rivers"" is simultaneously a stigma and a mark of distinction. <strong>The whole thing with bastard names is custom, not law.</strong><br>

</blockquote>

<p>However, the whole thing is a bit more relaxed than that, as can be seen above with bastard surnames being custom not law. As such it's likely that ""rules"" around noble surnames are more of a custom and not law though likely held to a higher degree of scrutiny given the weight they carry.</p>

<p>For what it's worth Janos Slynt was definitely a Slynt before becoming Lord of Harrenhall and founding House Slynt. Though he is already the commander of the City Watch at this point.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lord Renly Baratheon was less sympathetic. ""If you cannot keep the king's peace, Janos, perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can.""<br>
  Stout, jowly Janos Slynt puffed himself up like an angry frog, his bald pate reddening. ""Aegon the Dragon himself could not keep the peace, Lord Renly. I need more men.""<br>
  <sub>A Game of Thrones, Eddard VI</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I haven't been able to tie anything down to why this was the case so it could be any one of the following (speculation though of course):</p>

<ul>
<li>High ranking members of the City Watch can use names</li>
<li>Names are custom not law so as long as no one questions it you're fine</li>
<li>GRRM goofed</li>
</ul>

<p>As for Allar Deem the same sort of thing is likely considering he was Slynt's ""right arm"" and so high up again.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Truly."" Tyrion filled Lord Slynt's cup to the brim. ""I have been glancing over the names you put forward to take your place as Commander of the City Watch.""<br>
  ""Good men. Fine men. Any of the six will do, but I'd choose Allar Deem. My right arm. Good good man. Loyal. Pick him and you won't be sorry. If he pleases the king.""<br>
  <sub>A Clash of Kings, Tyrion II</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another option for this appears to be that there is a middle class in Westeros that aren't quite Noble yet but are also not common folk. This would appear to match with Slynt and Deem but there is no concrete case for this. It could also be that they just use the last name as a nickname or that no one questions it of course.</p>

<p>As for Jeyne Poole, well, House Poole are a noble House of the North.</p>

  <strong>Armory Lorch:</strong> My apologies, my lord.<br>
  <sub>Game of Thrones, Season 2 Episode 6, ""The Old Gods and the New""</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As @DariM points out later in the same episode Tywin tells Arya of Jaime struggling to read and so Tywin taught him himself. It also appears from the below that Jaime is dyslexic.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tywin Lannister:</strong> Who taught you to read?<br>
  <strong>Arya Stark:</strong> My father, my lord.<br>
  <strong>Tywin Lannister:</strong> Hmm. I taught my son Jaime to read. The maester came to me one day, told me he wasn't learning. He couldn't make sense of the letters. He reversed them in his head. The maester said he'd heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it. Ha! After that, I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned. He hated me for it, for a time. For a long time. But he learned.<br>
  <sub>ibid</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>From this we can infer that low or high born in Westeros not everyone will be able to read even if they have access to a maester's teachings. Jaime can only read now because Tywin did not give up when the maesters had already done so.</p>

<p>In the Dunk and Egg stories we also learn that Dunk, later Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, is illiterate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The old man had ridden with some of these knights; others Dunk knew from tales told in common rooms and round campfires. <strong>Though he had never learned the magic of reading or writing</strong>, the old man had been relentless when it came to teaching him heraldry, often drilling him as they rode.<br>
  <sub>The Hedge Knight</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dunk the lunk, thick as a castle wall. He felt his cheeks reddening again. <strong>Gingerly he took the parchment from the maester and scowled at the writing. Not a word of it was intelligible to him</strong>, but he knew the wax seal beneath the ornate signature; the three-headed dragon of House Targaryen. The king's seal. He was looking at a royal decree of some sort. <strong>Dunk moved his head from side to side so they would think that he was reading.</strong> ""There's a word here I can't make out,"" he muttered, after a moment. ""Egg, come have a look, you have sharper eyes than me.""<br>

"118125","Has anyone known married for love in Westeros?","<p>Do we have knowledge of someone relatively important (not necessarily a faction heir but neither a peasant) that married only for love?</p>

It is ironic that the hardest man in Westeros, one who feels nothing is more important than solidifying his family's heritage and rank; marries for love, and his own cousin no less. This is what makes their marriage a loving one, there was no advancement, not pact, no alliance to be made; just love.</p>

<p>Tyrion tells us this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lord Tywin seldom spoke of his wife, but Tyrion had heard his uncles talk of the love between them. In those days, his father had been Aerys’s Hand, and many people said that Lord Tywin Lannister ruled the Seven Kingdoms, but Lady Joanna ruled Lord Tywin.<br /><sup><em>-A Song of Ice and Fire: Book 3 - A Storm of Swords, Chapter Thrity-Eight (<a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Storm_of_Swords-Chapter_38"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tyrion V</a>).</em></sup></p>

It's true, they're estranged now, but they were married for love (or at least <em>they</em> thought it was love). You see, they were attracted to each other, they had found something they thought was love; which we now know as infatuation.</p>

<p>The author, George R. R. Martin <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Asshai.com_Interview_in_Barcelona"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">says this</a> of their marriage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It wasn't a good marriage. They married because of an attraction to something new and exotic. Sometimes, attraction happens when you least expect it. He was a prince of a distant country, and she was a woman full of life, who was very appealing, who came from a very different culture. When she comes to Dorne, she finds that there are customs that are different from those of Norvos, especially regarding the fostering away of children to others. This wasn't a political marriage, nor a magical one, it was simply an example of human nature. Sometimes relationships start on a good foot: you become acquainted, there's a great sexual attraction, you establish a relationship, you marry... and then in four or five years you realize that you don't really have anything in common, that at best you've made a mistake and are in a situation that doesn't have any easy solution in a society such as that of the Seven Kingdoms, where divorce simply isn't common. This is an example that it's not only marriages of convenience that fail, but even the marriages for love can fail.<br /><br />

<p>Tom of Sevenstreams sings it with Hot Pie on the ride to the Inn of the Kneeling Man. When Tom wants someone to sing with, Hot Pie tells him he knows the song about the bear. Tom starts to sing it and Hot Pie joins in lustily, even bouncing in his saddle a little on the rhymes. Arya Stark is astonished; Hot Pie has a good voice and sings well, she thought all he could do was bake. </p>

Sam knows a hundred songs but is so terrified he cannot think of any.

<p>Greatjon Umber sings it, drunkenly, at the Red Wedding.</p>

<p>During the Battle of Yunkai Ser Barristan Selmy tells Daenerys Targaryen that Robert Baratheon liked songs that made him laugh. Barristan adds that Robert only sang when he was drunk, and then by that point one of the songs was likely to be the ""The Bear and the Maiden Fair"". </p>

<li><strong>Balon Greyjoy:</strong>

<li>Wanted freedom for the Iron Islands, so that they could rape, pillage and be total douche-bags in peace. Also wanted to annex The North, because, why not?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Renly Baratheon:</strong>

<ul>
<li>For the lulz</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The War of The Five Kings isn't necessarily defined by the number of kings, especially given that there were never actually exactly five kings at the same time<sup>1</sup>; it's defined by their ""cause"".</p>

<h2>Causes</h2>

<p><strong>Stannis</strong> hasn't given up, he very openly hasn't accepted defeat and hasn't made peace<sup>2</sup>. He's currently working his <a href=""http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/stannis-the-mannis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">magic</a> against the Boltons in The North, believing that he must first save the Kingdom to win The Crown.</p>

<ul>
<li>Threat: ongoing.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Greyjoys</strong> haven't abandoned their cause either. Even after the death of Balon Greyjoy a new king is elected in a <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Kingsmoot#A_Feast_for_Crows"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kingsmoot</a>. In fact, after electing a new <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Euron_Greyjoy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mental case</a> as king, they increase their scope slightly and decide to take over all of Westeros.</p>

<ul>
<li>Threat: impending</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Daenerys</strong> is still threatening to return with her dragons and stuff. She's taken a small break to go on holidays with Drogon and hang out with <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jhaqo#A_Dance_with_Dragons"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Khal Jhaqo</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Threat... Umm, we'll see.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of the above, the <strong>Iron Throne</strong> has had to continue their campaigns against the pretenders. </p>

<h2>Entering Phase II</h2>

<p>No, really, we've <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/War_of_the_Five_Kings#New_hostilities"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">entered Phase II</a>. There are ""new hostilities"" which have re-ignited the War of the Five Kings. The new belligerents are:</p>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>When will it end?</strong><br>
There are many factors playing upon this clash of kings (lol, get it?). The main one being that Winter is Coming, and it has been geared to be a long winter, most probably followed by a <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Long_Night"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Long Night</a>.

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Varys releases Tyrion from prison, and Tyrion takes the opportunity to kill Lord Tywin. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>But a few things seem off at the surface. </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Tywin supposedly hates whores, but apparently has taken Shae to bed. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Shae doesn't seem at all surprised by seeing Tyrion. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This implies to me that Varys may have manipulated things to get Tyrion into a certain emotional state to become his unwitting tool. Granted, it wouldn't be a sure thing but Varys always seems to have a few irons in the fire. </p>

<p>Is there any evidence beyond what I've said to support this?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","186175","<p>It's unclear if Varys indeed set Tyrion up to go to the Tower of the Hand, however, I will challenge a few things with your assumptions for why Varys set him up.</p>

<h3>Tywin may not have hated whores</h3>

<p>As explained in <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/64576/58193"">this answer</a> to a related question it would appear that Tywin didn't have anything against whores only being publicly seen with them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You will <em>not</em> take the whore to court, Lord Tywin had commanded.</p>
  
  <p><sub>A Clash of Kings, Tyrion I</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""As was your mother."" Lord Tywin rose abruptly, to tower over his dwarf son. ""Go back to your bed, Tyrion, and speak to me no more of your rights to Casterly Rock. You shall have your reward, but it shall be one I deem appropriate to your service and station. <strong>And make no mistake—this was the last time I will suffer you to bring shame onto House Lannister. You are done with whores. The next one I find in your bed, I'll hang.</strong>""</p>
  
  <p><sub>A Storm of Swords, Tyrion I</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically Tywin is saying if I ever find/find out about a whore with you I will not be impressed but there's no objection to him just visiting one. In fact there's even speculation that Tywin was the one who had the tunnel dug to Chataya's.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""How is it a brothel happens to have a secret entrance?""</p>
  
  <p>""The tunnel was dug for another King's Hand, <strong>whose honor would not allow him to enter such a house openly.</strong> Chataya has closely guarded the knowledge of its existence.""</p>
  
  <p><sub>A Clash of Kings, Tyrion III</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>George R. R. Martin has also said that it is an ""interesting theory"" that Tywin was the Hand who had this tunnel built.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<h3>Shae did appear to be surprised at finding Tyrion</h3>

<p>Her reaction is one very much at surprise, though her not knowing Varys might plan to send Tyrion doesn't mean it wasn't Varys' intention.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""<strong>M'lord?</strong>"" a woman's voice called.</p>
  
  <p>That might have hurt me once, when I still felt pain. The first step was the hardest. When he reached the bed Tyrion pulled the draperies aside and there she was, turning toward him with a sleepy smile on her lips. <strong>It died when she saw him. She pulled the blankets up to her chin, as if that would protect her.</strong><br>
  ""Were you expecting someone taller, sweetling?""</p>
  
  <p><sub>A Storm of Swords, Tyrion XI</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Varys protested?</h3>

<p>Now as for if Varys had planned for Tyrion to go there. It could be a case that Varys protested too much for Tyrion going there whilst also giving detailed instructions for how to get to Tywin's chambers in the tunnels. It seems to be left open to interpretation if Varys was really trying to stop Tyrion or if that's what he wanted.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Yes."" Frozen hinges screamed in protest as Varys pulled open a long-closed door. Flakes of rust drifted to the floor. ""This will take us out to the river.""<br>
  Tyrion walked slowly to the ladder, ran his hand across the lowest rung. ""This will take me up to my bedchamber.""</p>
  
  <p>""Your lord father's bedchamber now.""</p>
  
  <p>He looked up the shaft. ""How far must I climb?""</p>
  
  <p>""My lord, you are too weak for such follies, and there is besides no time. We must go.""</p>
  
  <p>""I have business above. How far?""</p>
  
  <p>""Two hundred and thirty rungs, but whatever you intend—""</p>
  
  <p>""Two hundred and thirty rungs, and then?""</p>
  
  <p>""The tunnel to the left, but hear me—""</p>
  
  <p>""How far along to the bedchamber?"" Tyrion lifted a foot to the lowest rung of the ladder.</p>
  
  <p>""No more than sixty feet. Keep one hand on the wall as you go. You will feel the doors. The bedchamber is the third."" He sighed. ""This is folly, my lord. Your brother has given you your life back. Would you cast it away, and mine with it?""<br>
  ""Varys, the only thing I value less than my life just now is yours. Wait for me here."" He turned his back on the eunuch and began to climb, counting silently as he went.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>The room was prepared</h3>

<p>Now whilst not being proof it does seem lucky that Tywin's dagger was left on the bedside table and the crossbow had a box directly underneath it so Tyrion could reach it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Afterward he found Lord Tywin's dagger on the bedside table</strong> and shoved it through his belt. A lion-headed mace, a poleaxe, and a crossbow had been hung on the walls. The poleaxe would be clumsy to wield inside a castle, and the mace was too high to reach, but <strong>a large wood-and-iron chest had been placed against the wall directly under the crossbow.</strong> He climbed up, pulled down the bow and a leather quiver packed with quarrels, jammed a foot into the stirrup, and pushed down until the bowstring cocked. Then he slipped a bolt into the notch.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>Jaime was the catalyst</h3>

<p>As is pointed out in <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/186173/58193"">@JAD's answer</a> Jaime telling Tyrion the story of how Tysha wasn't actually a whore seems to be what pushed Tyrion over the edge.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Tysha?"" His stomach tightened. ""What of her?""</p>
  
  <p>""<strong>She was no whore. I never bought her for you. That was a lie that Father commanded me to tell.</strong> Tysha was... she was what she seemed to be. A crofter's daughter, chance met on the road.""</p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <p>""Oh, you've earned more than that, Jaime. <strong>You and my sweet sister and our loving father, yes, I can't begin to tell you what you've earned. But you'll have it, that I swear to you.</strong> A Lannister always pays his debts."" Tyrion waddled away, almost stumbling over the turnkey again in his haste. Before he had gone a dozen yards, he bumped up against an iron gate that closed the passage. Oh, gods. It was all he could do not to scream.</p>
  
  <p><sub>A Storm of Swords, Tyrion XI</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And as is pointed out Jaime certainly didn't want to his father dead nor did he know where Varys was so it seems unlikely he had any part in the plan.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>He never said he meant to kill our father. If he had, I would have stopped him.</strong> Then I would be the kinslayer, not him.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Jaime wondered where Varys was hiding. Wisely, the master of whisperers had not returned to his own chambers</strong>, nor had a search of the Red Keep turned him up. It might be that the eunuch had taken ship with Tyrion, rather than remain to answer awkward questions. If so, the two of them were well out to sea by now, sharing a flagon of Arbor gold in the cabin of a galley.</p>
  
  <p><sub>A Feast for Crows, Jaime I</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Varys the opportunist</h3>

<p>It could just be that Varys didn't plan any of this but seeing the opportunity for someone to take out a great military leader of the enemy, he took it. This could seem likely as he would undoubtedly not have prepped Jaime for telling Tyrion about Tysha.</p>

<hr>

<p>In conclusion there is nothing pointing either way for if Varys wanted Tyrion to visit his father or not but there are a few signposts that could look like he wanted him to.</p>

<p>Letters/correspondence in Westeros are sealed with 1) the house sigil in wax or 2) the emblem of the position (e.g. the Hand of the King). </p>

<li>Would other Lords recognize his personal sigil? I know Baelish is infamous as Master of Coin, but do all the Lords know his name directly?  Would it matter, since once the letter is opened it is also signed?</li>

"120238","Is there any evidence Jon was legitimized?","<p>Ned Stark has five legitimate children (in order of age) Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran, and Rickon. Up through the events of A Dance With Dragons we end up with the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Robb - dead</p>

  <p> Sansa - Alive, at the Eyrie, under the protection of Littlefinger who is plotting <em>something</em>.</p>

  <p> Rickon - Alive, MIA (Davos has been sent to see if he is hiding on Skagos)</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>Sansa and Rickon would have the best claims based on the above information. This would also mean that the Boltons will have to be stripped of their titles over the North as well. I do not see this as a major problem as the other Lords of the North believe only a Stark can rule Winterfell. </p>

<p>Sansa seems to be in a position to claim sooner, but Rickon is liable to just pop out of nowhere (much like Aegon VI). Littlefinger will not have wanted all his hard work to go to waste, so I would imagine he will do anything to install Sansa. The other Lords of the North may back Rickon as he is male... given the general rules of succession in Westeros, male heirs are given priority over females. However, with the state of turmoil most of these rules are subject to all kinds of interpretations and ignorance.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>However, there is final option... Jon Snow.</strong> If Jon was able to secure a royal decree making him a true Stark his claim would be better than both Sansa (Jon is male) and Rickon (Jon is older). <strong>Is there any evidence that this has happened?</strong></p>

","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><jon-snow>","120261","<p>It's Jon. Robb legitimised him before his death, which he was legally able to do as King in the North, and so Jon is Ned Stark's legitimate heir and the rightful Lord of Winterfell and King in the North. Even his Night's Watch vows are no longer an obstacle, since they only bound him until death, and he has now died (presumably to be resurrected in some way).</p>

<p>In <em>A Storm of Swords</em>, Robb and Catelyn have the following conversation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Mother.” There was a sharpness in Robb’s tone. “You forget. My father
  had four sons.”</p>
  
  <p>She had not forgotten; she had not wanted to look at it, yet there it
  was. “A Snow is not a Stark.”</p>
  
  <p>“Jon’s more a Stark than some lordlings from the Vale who have never
  so much as set eyes on Winterfell.”</p>
  
  <p>“Jon is a brother of the Night’s Watch, sworn to take no wife and hold
  no lands. Those who take the black serve for life.”</p>
  
  <p>“So do the knights of the Kingsguard. That did not stop the Lannisters
  from stripping the white cloaks from Ser Barristan Selmy and Ser Boros
  Blount when they had no more use for them. If I send the Watch a
  hundred men in Jon’s place, I’ll wager they find some way to release
  him from his vows.”</p>
  
  <p>He is set on this. Catelyn knew how stubborn her son could be. “A
  bastard cannot inherit.”</p>
  
  <p>“Not unless he’s legitimized by a royal decree,” said Robb. “There is
  more precedent for that than for releasing a Sworn Brother from his
  oath.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Robb then has a council with his lords as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He picked up a sheet of parchment. “One more matter. Lord Balon has
  left chaos in his wake, we hope. I would not do the same. Yet I have
  no son as yet, my brothers Bran and Rickon are dead, and my sister is
  wed to a Lannister. I’ve thought long and hard about who might follow
  me. I command you now as my true and loyal lords to fix your seals to
  this document as witnesses to my decision.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's not clear what has happened to that sheet of parchment. Robb then sent Galbart Glover and Maege Mormont to Howland Reed at Greywater Watch, but the written messages they carried were false, in case they were captured.</p>

<p>It is claimed in <a href=""https://www.quora.com/Does-Robb-Stark-declare-Jon-Snow-his-heir"">an answer on Quora</a> that the <em>World of Ice and Fire</em> companion volume, which was written with the approval of George R R Martin, confirms that Jon <em>was</em> legitimized by Robb.

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","53580","<p>The main features are that they are stronger and lighter than normal steel blades. Also, the Valyrian steel has been lost along with Valyria, meaning that there only a few Valyrian Steel blades left in the world.

  <p>Only the greatest weaponsmiths can reforge swords from existing
  Valyrian steel, but the secret of creating such an alloy was
  apparently lost with Valyria, making those remaining weapons highly
  treasured and extremely rare. The blacksmiths of Qohor claim to know
  how to reforge Valyrian steel, and Tobho Mott did reforge Ice at the

"121048","In A Clash of Kings, why does Cersei initially oppose marrying Joffrey to Margaery?","<p>In <em>A Clash of Kings</em>, when the Small Council hears of the assassination of Renly Baratheon, Tyrion realizes that the Lannisters can no longer depend on the Baratheon brothers decimating each other in battle before either of them reaches King's Landing. He proposes marrying Joffrey to Margaery Tyrell in order to win the support of the Tyrells and other southron lords that were formerly sworn to Renly, and Cersei immediately objects, stating that Joffrey is betrothed to Sansa.</p>

<p>Cersei is no Ned Stark, so I doubt she is trying to preserve the betrothal out of respect or honour. She despised her late husband, who made the match, and she despises the Starks as well. Tyrion is also quick to point out that a marriage to Sansa is worth peanuts after Ned's death and Robb's march against the Lannisters. </p>

<p>Why is Cersei against marrying Joffrey to Margaery when there are next to no disadvantages?

"121143","Why do Hoster and Edmure Tully not rally their forces?","<p>Raiders swoop in from the Westerlands, emboldened by Tywin's promises of sweet, sweet loot. Robb Stark calls his banners. What do the noble lords of Riverrun do? Disband their forces along the entire length of their border. When Tywin invades, they struggle to regroup their forces, and what they do manage to gather gets shattered by a Lannister army much larger than their own. Robb Stark is still in Moat Cailin. While Edmure and Hoster seem to care about their people, disbanding their forces is something I would imagine our sweet Robert Arryn doing, not the lords of Riverrun.</p>

<p>Surely they had at least heard of the many Kings of the Trident who ended up dead after attempting to defend their entire realm? Next, Edmure manages to rally his troops, though not before taking heavy losses. He harasses Jaime Lannister in his siege of Riverrun. Stark arrives and shatters the Westerlander host. What does Edmure do? He disbands his forces <strong>AGAIN</strong>! At this point, I start to question both his sanity and his intelligence.</p>

<p>The Westerland armies outnumbered both the Stark and Tully hosts, probably even combined as Tywin had bolstered his own manpower with sellswords. What got into the minds of the Tully's with disbanding their armies? I know for the latter case, Edmure said something along the lines of ""I can't ask them to fight for me when their families and people are being slaughtered and their keeps put to the torch,"" but keeping his lords rallied to Stark would have ended the slaughter a whole lot sooner and possibly given him enough men to challenge Tywin's main host. Did Edmure see this and ignore it? What about Hoster?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><warfare>","127924","<h2>Sworn swords of the Rock</h2>

<p>First of all, the raiders from Westerlands were <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Gregor_Clegane"" rel=""nofollow"">Clegane troops</a> who did not need any persuasion from Tywin about looting. They were sworn to Casterly Rock as regular levies/soldiers, they weren't Mercenaries like Lord Goat or Clansmen from the Vale. (But Clegane did promise them riches however.)</p>

<h2>Robert I Baratheon's influence</h2>

<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Robert_I_Baratheon"" rel=""nofollow"">Robert</a> was a strong Monarch who had recently broken <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Greyjoy&#39;s_Rebellion"" rel=""nofollow"">rebellion of Balon Greyjoy</a>. No doubt Riverrun did believe that in event of a war, the Iron throne would intervene which was the reason behind the slow mobilization of Tully banners, this false sense of security. However Tullys did send a force of 4,000 men with Lords Vance and Piper in command at Golden tooth which is one direct Road from heart of Westerlands to Riverlands. Defending a narrow pass is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae"" rel=""nofollow"">much easier than a pitched battle</a> because a few thousand determined troops defending such a terrain can nullify numerical advantage of their enemy (Even though not indefinitely unless your enemies are utterly incompetent). At that time, Tully host was at riverrun. After Clegane circumvented the Tully guards at the Tooth, Edmure being the tactless fool that he was, <strong>dispersed, not disbanded</strong> his armies to stop the raiders, no doubt ascertained that in case it were to boil into an all-out-war, Robert would make it stop. </p>

<p>Edmure had a point to be fair. If they could intercept the raiders and capture one of them alive, they could get a confession out of the captive that he was sent by Lannisters. Then Tullys could formally complain to Iron Throne that Lannisters had broken King's Peace.</p>

<h2>Tywin Lannister's objectives</h2>

<p>Tywin Lannister did not intend to fight an all-out war any ways. His objective was to capture Eddard Stark if he was fool enough to lead his men himself (Which he would have done if not for his injured leg, courtesy of Jaime). That way he could punish Catelyn, save his house's honor by ransoming Tyrion back and if Iron throne intervened, he would have found some pretext that Tullys initiated the hostilities as there was no proof that bannerless raiders were Westerlanders. </p>

<h2>Death of Robert and Jaime's command</h2>

<p>What Riverrun did not imagine was death of Robert and ascension of Prince Joffrey Totally-Baratheon to the iron throne. Remember, Tywin Lannister did not openly take the field while Robert drew breath, he was not a fool. Another thing Tullys did not expect was that Jaime Lannister would be the one to open the action at Golden Tooth, probably assuming that he was serving in KL as KG. Jaime was no political genius but by all accounts he was an excellent military leader albeit rash and prone to using brute-force instead of smart battle tactics. 15,000 Westerlanders <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_in_the_hills_below_the_Golden_Tooth"" rel=""nofollow"">cut their way through</a> the meagre 4000 garrison at Golden Tooth. </p>

<h2>Battle of Riverrun</h2>

<p>The <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_under_the_walls_of_Riverrun"" rel=""nofollow"">Battle of Riverrun</a> in which Edmund was captured was not after some hasty regrouping of Tully Forces. Tullys had called their banners much earlier and the 4,000 Token guards were chosen from the Riverlander banners. Even vassals as far as Harrenhal had sent their levies to Riverrun which is implied because <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Shella_Whent"" rel=""nofollow"">Shella Whent</a> surrendered Harrenhal due to lack of defenders as her forces were in Riverrun with her liege lord.  It was the entire available strength of House Tully (Minus the power of Houses Frey &amp; Mallister and forces sent to defend the border regions) which got smashed by Jaime. Westerlands were richer than riverlands and Tywin Lannister paid generously to get his troops well-equipped so they had that advantage as well. From Chapter 31 AGOT, Tyrion observing boots of his slain man:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They were good boots, as befit one of Lord Tywin's men; heavy leather,
  oiled and supple</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If Tywin cared so much about his soldiers' boots, imagine what he did for their swords and equipment. (But one must keep in mind the difference between Sworn Swords and Peasant levies). Not to mention the excellent leadership of Jaime Lannister.</p>

<p>So Edmure did not harrass Jaime during siege at all, seeing as siege began after battle of Riverrun and Edmure was taken captive in that. </p>

<h2>Jaime's failure</h2>

<p>However here Jaime lost the advantage. He smashed the Tully Forces but he could not destroy them. Instead of playing it slow and annihilate the opposition with encirclement tactics, he collided head-on, as a result Tullys were <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_under_the_walls_of_Riverrun"" rel=""nofollow"">defeated not destroyed</a>. Scattered, not broken. Marq Piper and Karl Vance continued guerrilla attacks and Lords of Seagard and The Twins had entire of their strengths unscathed.  </p>

<h2>Numerical disparity among combatants</h2>

<p>As for complete Numerical advantage, we do not know. We know Robb went South with 23,000 swords roughly. We know Lannister strength was 35,000 men divided into two hosts of 20,000 and 15,000. We however do not know Strength of house Tully. It would be a safe guess to assume that Riverlands could muster 24,000-25,000 swords at least because it was richer and <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Seven_Kingdoms#Population"" rel=""nofollow"">more populated than North</a> at least, if not Westerlands. In all conclusion, together Starks and Tullys would have outnumbered Lannisters. Tywin was too seasoned a commander to allow that to happen, so he seized the initiative and routed the riverlords before they had a chance to join their full strengths to Starks. Even while doing that he ensured that there was his host lying strategically between Riverlands and KL.</p>

<h2>Stark relief force and further Tully follies</h2>

<p>After that, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_in_the_Whispering_Wood"" rel=""nofollow"">Starks come into scene</a>. Jaime's host <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_the_Camps"" rel=""nofollow"">gets destroyed</a>. Fast Forward, Robb goes off to burn Westerlands. That's when Edmure makes the ultimate error of sending a force of 11,000 men to <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_the_Fords"" rel=""nofollow"">defend different border sectors</a>. Even at that point he had not disbanded his armies. He simply dispersed them to fight small local action instead of waiting for a large pitched battle. </p>

<h2>Hoster Tully's role</h2>

<p>Hoster Tully was in no condition to think about warfare. He was drifting into dreams about Tansy and past and his mental health was devastated. Which left Riverlands into unexperienced hands of Edmure with not even his uncle to counsel him. He allowed the lords to leave for their lands and he sent more forces to fight along side them. Which essentially dispersed the Tully strength. But that was after all Edmure's plan all along, due to his lack of skill in field of strategy and warfare. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion:</p>

<ol>
<li>Edmure and Hoster did not disband their forces at the beginning. They had called the banners as soon as they heard of Lannister mobilization. They were however wrong to be lulled into false sense of security by presence of Robert on throne. The force guarding the Golden tooth should not have been there or should have been ordered to  fight a retreat in case of a bigger adversary with main role as scouts. Moreover they should have posted archers on high ground on mountains surrounding the golden tooth but instead they gave a battle which is called ""Battle in the hills below Golden Tooth"". When you try to fight a hopeless battle without any defined role and without exploiting the terrain for your advantage, results are catastrophic. Other lords should not have been dispersed either.</li>
<li>Edmure did not harass Jaime during the siege of Riverrun because Siege did not begin until Jaime had scattered the main Tully host and captured Edmure.</li>
<li>Hoster Tully was terminally ill and lost in his past. He was in no fit way to think up strategy.</li>
<li>Edmure was no Robb or Jaime or Tywin. He was utterly incompetent when it came to warfare. Therefore he made the grave error which lead House Tully and Stark to grave. He dispersed his forces to fight local actions and throw Lannisters back. Again, he did not disband his Forces. </li>
<li>It was not only incompetence. He personally wanted to prove himself a great warrior due to envy. He was seeing his Child-King Nephew to grow into a legendary warrior and he was envious of that. As he says in ASOS, Chapter XIV:

<blockquote>
  <p>""What, is no one to win victories but the Young Wolf? Did I steal some
  glory meant for you, Robb?""</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<p>He wanted to win some victories of his own. He lacked the sense to
    see however that those victories would lead to his ultimate defeat.</p>

"121413","How are new members of the Kingsguard decided?","<p>As far as I'm aware it is the King or Queen (or the Regent on behalf of the King/Queen) who decides the people assigned to the Kingsguard, who are supposed to be a selection of <strong>the greatest swordsmen in Westeros</strong>. However, it's highly improbable that the monarch would be able to see a significant number of swordsmen in action in order to be able to make an informed decision as to who is suitable for the role.</p>

<p>It's possible that trusted advisers, such as those on the small council or others within the Kingsguard, could offer advice and nominate those who may be worthy of the position when an opening becomes available. But again, I can't imagine they manage to travel enough to meet potential candidates.</p>

<p>There is always word of mouth as to the ability of swordsmen, but that can sometimes be <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/87012/is-there-any-proof-that-jaime-lannister-is-actually-a-good-swordsman"">unreliable</a>. And there are tourneys in which knights can show off their abilities, but again it doesn't seem like that would make a consistent selection method, as a holding a new tourney every time a member of the Kingsguard dies would be expensive.</p>

<p>So is the pool of candidates smaller than the reputed ""greatest swordsmen in the land""? Is it instead just people close to the King/Queen who manage to work their way up politically in order to garner favor with the royal family, ensuring their selection when an opportunity presents itself?</p>

<p>Or is there some sort of trial that candidates go through to prove they are worthy? Would those wanting the position have to approach the King/Queen personally and prove themselves fit for the job?</p>

<hr>

<p>Prior to the events of the books, I feel there really isn't very much depth as to how previous members of the Kingsguard who were famously skilled with a sword (Barristan Selmy, Arthur Dayne etc.) were selected in the first place.</p>

<p>Since then, the majority of the selections have been done by Cersei, who has filled the ranks of the Kingsguard mainly with people she trusts and who she knows will not betray the king in this particularly volatile political climate, and who will do as she commands, as opposed to people who are actually particularly skilled swordsmen.</p>

<p>So is/was there any kind of standardized selection process, or would the King simply select new members at whim for any reason whatsoever?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","121476","<p>It does seem to be solely on the whim of the monarch or regent. As for on what basis, here are a few observations from appointments other than Cersei's in A Feast For Crows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Under normal/ideal circumstances, when places become available, it seems to go as a <em>reward</em> or honour to people who have recently displayed heroism.</strong> This seems to be what happened with our <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Barristan_Selmy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Barristan</a>, who was a war hero in the War of the Ninepenny Kings, then later was offered a place in the kingsguard. This seems to be the classic ""fairytale"" appointment that naive youngsters like Dunk in the <em>Knight of The Seven Kingdoms</em> stories daydream about and motivates people to go above and beyond - the idea that, if you do something great, it could earn you the greatest personal honour going, along with fame, luxury and status for life and a place in the history books. When there's no war or other such opportunity for <em>proper</em> heroism, it seems like an impressive run at tournaments plus general good reputation and popularity can be enough.

<ul>
<li><strong>Knights (and others) who prove themselves can request the honour.</strong> For example, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?title=Brienne_Tarth&amp;redirect=no"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Brienne</a> asked Renly for the spare place Renly was holding open in case Barristan wanted to defect, after proving herself in a tournament, and <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jaime_Lannister"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Jaime</a> ""made it known"" via Cersei and others that he'd be interested, in order to avoid having to marry Lysa Arryn (smart move) and to be closer to Cersei (not such a smart move), after earning a reputation through tournaments and fighting the Kingswood Brotherhood. This of course depends on there being a spot available, and the decision is entirely up to the monarch in question.</li>
<li><strong>Monarchs can promise places to individuals, once places become available.</strong> Early in <em>The Mystery Knight</em> (no plot spoilers here, don't worry), we hear an old story about a famous, acclaimed and at the time of that story long-dead knight <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Quentyn_Ball"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ser Quentyn Ball</a>, who was promised a place one day by the infamous <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon_the_unworthy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Aegon ""The Unworthy"" IV</a>, and who even went as far as encouraging his wife to become a <strike>nun</strike> Silent Sister so he'd be unmarried when the day came - but then the king died and the new king chose someone else. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Personal factors and whims influence heavily.</strong> With Aegon and Ball again, it's strongly implied that the whoring and violent Ball and the notorious Aegon had plenty in common in terms of attitude, personality and recreational interests; whereas Aegon's mild-mannered successor ""<a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daeron_II_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Daeron the Good</a>"" chose not to honour Aegon's promise and went with someone more moderate and more to his tastes. Another example of personal factors would be ""Mad"" Aerys being persuaded to choose Jaime, which appealed to him as a way to spite Tywin. </li>
<li><p><strong>It's often contrived to facilitate a... <em>special relationship</em> between a Kingsguard member and a king,</strong> or someone else high up in court, whereby the knight vowing to be unmarried and keeping close by is... <em>convenient</em> to both parties. Renly and Loras is an obvious example, and Jaime and Cersei is an example showing it's not just kings who might contrive to help a budding Kingsguard keep his sword sharp. Here's a third example which does include a pretty big unavoidable <em>A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms</em> spoiler:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> It's strongly implied that there's something going on between wannabe-King <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daemon_II_Blackfyre"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Daemon II Blackfyre</a>, and the euphemistically-named <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Alyn_Cockshaw"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lord Alyn Cockshaw</a> - the latter becoming murderously jealous when Daemon takes a keen interest in a certain tall, strapping knight and starts talking about making him a key part of his kingsguard.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>And then of course there's all the factional politics we see plenty of in A Feast For Crows.</p>

<p>Is there an in-universe explanation of why</p>

<ul>
<li>such a recent arrival to the Night's Watch is in such a high position of power (apparently quite at the top of the chain of command) and why</li>
<li>he can still insist on being addressed as ""Lord of Harrenhal"", although men of the Night's Watch ""<em>hold no lands</em>""?</li>
</ul>

<p>(The explanation in the TV show makes sense: Alliser Thorne is ""acting Lord Commander"", so he can just declare that his buddy has a seat on the panel that decides Jon's fate. I don't remember him being ""acting Lord Commander"" in the books, though.)</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","54417","<p>His insisting on claiming his supposed title is nothing more than meaningless posturing on his part, as he <em>wasn't</em> Lord of Harrenhal anymore by the time he arrived at The Wall. He was stripped of that title by Tyrion, and Harrenhal was subsequently given to Littlefinger.</p>

<p>As far as his influence on the wall, I don't think it's even made explicit, but there are a number of things that Slynt has going for him over your average raw recruit:</p>

<ul>
<li>He was a former Commander of the City Watch (the Goldcloaks), and Lord of Harrenhal, so he would probably get a higher starting position. Remember our very first scene in <em>A Game of Thrones</em> has a former nobleman, now in the Night's Watch, outranking a clearly more experienced and qualified Night's Watchman (before getting Other'd to death).</li>
<li>He rapidly allies himself with existing ranking members of the Watch, like Thorne. By accusing someone that many of the brothers already disliked, he earned their allegiance; and 90% of getting a position of power is simply having other people accept that you deserve that power.</li>
<li>He has the explicit backing of the Lannisters, both Tywin (who's filthy rich) and Joffrey (who, by that point, had basically won the war.) Again, that makes it likely that other ranking Watch officers would follow his lead, in hopes of earning favor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, a subsequent events will ultimately demonstrate, he has no <em>official</em> authority in the Night's Watch, only that he can derive from his high-powered friends:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> He gets no support from Stannis nor most of the Watch when he makes a play for Lord Commander, and ultimately, Jon tries to send him away. With Tywin no longer alive to support Slyn, Jon simply executes him for insubordiation when he refuses.</p>

"54507","How big of a deal is Westeros?","<p>Of course, Westeros is the main stage for A Song of Ice and Fire, but how important is it at a planetary scope?</p>

<p>There is a lot of civilization beyond the Narrow Sea and, especially around the Narrow Sea, most of it is very evolved in terms of society and economy. Also the Dothraki may live a very wildling-ish life, but they appear neither afraid of nor foreign to higher cultures. There are also the Wildlings north of the wall, which also seems to be a large civilization.</p>

<p>So how important is Westeros to the entire planet? Are they a few among many or are they the most sophisticated society on that planet and take a rather leading role?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>More information I found</strong></p>

<p>I re-watched the TV show and did a little army counting on the side. The numbers don't feel mathematically sound, but maybe the Westerosi are very good at accounting for losses in most recent battles, while I'm not. Give or take a few garrisons, all of Westeros has (had) about 300K soldiers. If I had to guess I'd say that's a little more than the Wildlings and all of Essos put together, but I can't find solid numbers on those. So, measuring in military size and assuming there aren't any other big inhabited continents we don't know of, Westeros is about half the world. I'm still having trouble gauging the size of Essos.</p>

<p>In Yunkai alone, there are about 200K slaves (according to TV show S3E7). This allows for speculation that Yunkai alone has a population somewhere between 200K and 1M people. If Yunkai does not greatly outsize all other Free Cities, Essos probably has a much larger population than Westeros. Kings Landing has a population of 500k.</p>

<p><strong>Even more information I found</strong></p>

<p>Just reading A Storm of Swords and it would appear Mereen, Yunkai and Astapor are not of the nine Free Cities. IIRC, I got this impression from the Daenerys chapter where she talks to Kraznys mo Nakloz for the first time.
Comparing impressions from reading the books vs. the TV series, according to the book there are way more Dothraki and other tribes/people living on that side of the narrow sea. So in terms of population I would reduce my guess, making Westeros about one third of the known world.</p>

<p>In terms of society and technology I also wouldn't call Westeros leading. Their beliefs and knowledge seem to have devolved over time. There are the new gods and people somehow accept there are old gods as well. Everything else is little more than folly, if at all. The Maesters can choose to study magic but few do and none can actually perform magic. The alchemists seem a pathetic guild of engineers. Nobody believes there are things like mammoths, giants, skinchangers and such. The remaining acknowledged supernatural thing are the Children of the Forest, but even here everybody knows there aren't any left anywhere.</p>

<p>In Essos, many beliefs are practiced, but people are hardly judged by that. Maegi are more than tales and everything that may seem impossible/unrealistic can be done by at least one person from Asshai. If not, you will still find at least one person who will claim they once met someone from Asshai who could. The Warlocks in Qarth live more ore less openly among other people. In general, the Free Cities appear bigger not only in population and size but also the architecture, than any dwelling in Westeros. All of Essos seems well arranged, even settled, while all of Westeros goes to war whenever a highborn firstborn hits puberty.</p>

Currently there are 4 known continents of the known world: <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Westeros"">Westeros,</a> <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Essos"">Essos,</a> <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Sothoryos"">Sothoryos,</a> and <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ulthos"">Ulthos.</a> We should remember that civilisation in the known world is currently at a state where there are many parts of the world still uncharted. It is entirely possible that there are more continents that are not known. Consider the late discovery of the Americas, and the even later discovery of Australia, by Eurasian civilisation.</p>

<p>Further to this, we don't even know a significant amount about the four continents. Little is known about Sothoryos, and almost nothing is known about Ulthos. Even the two continents that are known, Westeros and Essos, are not fully charted. No complete map of Essos exists, and the polar regions to the far north of Westeros, way beyond the Wall are still unexplored. However, these lands are unlikely to contain any great civilisation, if life at all, so we can consider the knowledge to be sufficient.</p>

<p>So this means that any answer can only truly be based on a comparison between Westeros and Essos.</p>

<p>The main difference between Westeros and Essos is that the former is united as The Seven Kingdoms (clearly the civil wars in A Song of Ice and Fire throw this into question, but lets look at this from the start of the series). With the exception of a few raids from the wildlings, a few pirates along the narrow sea, and bandits roaming the kingdom, Westeros has enjoyed relative peace. This has allowed their civilisation to prosper. Lords are free to devote resources to keeping roads safe, and clearing bandit raids, allowing smaller villages and farmsteads to enjoy a safer life.</p>

<p>Essos consists of many different peoples. A few of the most significant are the Dothraki, the Free Cities, the Lhazareen, Qarth, and many other regions. One of the main territories was the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Valyrian_Freehold"">Valyrian Freehold.</a> Once a great, powerful and knowledgeable territory, left in ruins and all but extinct since the Doom of Valyria.</p>

<p>As Essos is not united, the internal fighting, and the threat of the fierce Dothraki, has shaped the continent into a very different civilisation to Westeros. Rather than many villages and farms surrounding a Lord's castle, as is the case with Westeros, much of the Essos civilisation consists of huge, fruitful cities, with high walls and little outside. An obvious example of this is Qarth. An impressive port city, booming on trade, but surrounded by nothing but wasteland. The reason for this sort of growth, is that smaller villages struggle to withstand the Dothraki. The Lhazareen are constantly under attack from the Dothraki, and the Kingdom of Sarnor has been left in ruins from Dothraki attack. Therefore the best option for civilisation in Essos is a concentrated city, near the sea, allowing them to amass a large, single army to defend them, surrounded by high city walls.</p>

<p>It's hard to compare different civilisations in this world, as it is not a global world such as our own. Westeros is quite insular, but is clearly a significant land mass and civilisation within the known world. I'll try and find canon examples of mentions of Westeros' significance, but hopefully this will provide you with enough information.</p>

In my version of events, I (Aegon) learned (after defeating the Lannister and Baratheon armies) that I am a Blackfyre.

"188780","How does “Valar morghulis” translate to “all men must die”?","<p>Near as I can tell from the Valyrian language wiki, it consists of the noun “man” in the collective and the verb “die” in the present active infinite. Essentially, “men collectively (to/do) die.” I do not understand where the “must” part comes in, but the analytical English is my mother tongue so the subtlety of a clearly Latin-inspired inflectional language is lost on me.</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><languages>","188860","<p><strong>Yes, <em>valar morghūlis</em> does mean ‘all men must die’.</strong></p>

<p><a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/188782"">TheLethalCarrot’s answer</a> gives most of the background of High Valyrian, but unfortunately misparses some of the grammar of the sentence, which results in a misunderstanding of how and why the phrase means what it means. The same misunderstanding also rears its head in <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/188810"">Mithrandir24601’s answer</a>. This is going to be an awfully long answer to describe the grammar in detail and explain exactly why <em>valar morghūlis</em> does mean ‘all men must die’.</p>

<p>There are two essential things to understand in the phrase:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>1. <em>Valar</em> is not plural, but collective</h2>

<p>High Valyrian nouns have <a href=""https://wiki.dothraki.org/High_Valyrian_Number"" rel=""noreferrer"">four numbers</a>: apart from singular (one X) and plural (several Xes), it also has <em>collective</em> (a lot of Xes, all Xes) and <em>paucal</em> (a few Xes, some Xes).</p>

<p>The word meaning ‘man’ is the <a href=""https://wiki.dothraki.org/High_Valyrian_Gender"" rel=""noreferrer"">lunar</a> noun <em>vala</em>, which has the plural <em>vali</em>, paucal <em>valun</em>, and collective <em>valar</em> (in the nominative case).</p>

<p><em>Valar</em> is thus the collective form, and it does in fact mean ‘all men’ or ‘a great host of men’, or ‘mankind’ (as opposed to ‘womankind’)—it’s the form that sees all men as a single entity.</p>

<p>This ‘single entity’ bit is important. Unlike nouns, verbs and adjectives have only two numbers: singular and plural (like English); there are no collective or paucal verb or adjective forms. Instead, paucal nouns take plural endings, and <strong>collective nouns take singular endings</strong>. Because the collection of all mankind is seen as a singular entity, it counts as a form of singular.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>2. <em>Morghūlis</em> is not present, but aorist</h2>

<p>The table that TheLethalCarrot cites in his answer shows that <em>morghūlis</em> is the third person plural form of <em>morghūljagon</em> in the present indicative active—which is true. It is. But as we’ve just seen, a collective noun counts as a singular and should take a singular form, not a plural form. So <em>valar</em> cannot be the subject of <em>morghūlis</em>—that would be like saying “a man die” or “all men dies” in English.</p>

<p>Luckily, if we take another look at the verbal conjugation tables, more specifically at the <a href=""https://wiki.dothraki.org/High_Valyrian_Verb_Conjugation#Aorist"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>aorist aspect-tense</strong></a> further down on the page, a solution presents itself. <em>Morghūljagon</em> is a consonant-final verb (the L is the end of the root), so it conjugates like <em>jaelagon</em> in the table. This means the third person singular (which is what we are looking for) ends in <em>-is</em> in the aorist indicative active: <em>morghūlis</em>. Perfect.</p>

<p>So the phrase <em>valar morghūlis</em> is a collective, aorist phrase.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Present, aorist… what’s the difference?</h2>

<p>What the actual difference is between the present and the aorist is something that requires some extra knowledge and describing.</p>

<p>If you take a look at the <a href=""https://wiki.dothraki.org/High_Valyrian_Verb_Conjugation#Time_and_aspect"" rel=""noreferrer"">time and aspect</a> table at the top of the verb conjugation page, you’ll see that High Valyrian verb forms can be interpreted as encoding two separate notions: <strong>time</strong> and <strong>aspect</strong>. The present and the aorist are both under the ‘Basic Aspect’, but in different time categories.</p>

<p>The concepts of time and aspect both require some introduction, because they’re not necessarily very intuitive if you’re not a linguist, and different languages often treat them in different ways.</p>

<p><strong>Time</strong> is simple enough, really: as far as High Valyrian (and English, mostly) goes, it’s essentially past, present, future, and indeterminate. That is, you can explicitly mark that an action took place in the past, takes place in the present, or will take place in the future—or you can leave out the time information altogether, making it context-dependent or just plain uncertain when the action took/takes/will take place. The first three exist in English; the last one doesn’t as a separate category. To express something timeless, we just use the simple present in English (“The earth is round”, “The universe is huge”, etc.—those things are true in the present, but also in the past and future). In High Valyrian, however, they are distinct categories, so there are explicit ways to say that something does not relate to time, but is either universally true or just time-agnostic.</p>

<p><strong>Aspect</strong> is more complex and vague: it’s a concept that describes “the way in which time is denoted by a verb” (<a href=""https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/aspect"" rel=""noreferrer"">ODO</a>, sense 3); that is, different ways of looking at a particular time. For example, the present <em>time</em> can be looked at from various aspectual angles, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>basic/default aspect</strong> (something that occurs in the present time, with no emphasis on anything else: “I feel sick”)</li>
<li><strong>progressive/continuous aspect</strong> (something that is currently ongoing: “I am feeling sick”, “I am writing a letter”)</li>
<li><strong>habitual aspect</strong> (something that tends to be in a certain way regularly or out of habit: “I feel sick on Saturday mornings”)</li>
<li><strong>universal aspect</strong> (something that is always true: “The universe is huge”). We’d consider this an aspect of presentness in English, but in High Valyrian it wouldn’t be</li>
<li><strong>resultative aspect</strong> (something that is so in the present, but is the result of something happened in the past: “I have eaten two hamburgers”)</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>So what does that mean?</h2>

<p>In English, the simple present tense tends to actually denote the habitual or universal aspects for most verbs (“I drive a car”, “I eat breakfast”, “I like tea”), while the basic or default aspect tends to merge with the progressive aspect: if we want to say that the statement ⟨drive a car⟩ is something which occurs in the present moment with me as the actor/subject, we have to use the present continuous construction, “I am driving a car”. This is not true for all verbs, though: some verbs distinguish the basic and the progressive aspects quite well. “I am at school” is basic aspect (it just deals with a singular, current moment in time and describes it), whereas “You’re being an idiot” is progressive (it emphasises that the idiocy is something that is currently ongoing, not just a moment-in-time snapshot).</p>

<p>You could say that the English <strong>present tense</strong> most commonly combines <em>present time</em> with either <em>habitual aspect</em> or <em>universal aspect</em>, and only sometimes with <em>basic aspect</em>. The <strong>present progressive</strong> combines <em>present time</em> with either <em>progressive aspect</em> or <em>basic aspect</em>.</p>

<p>In High Valyrian, on the other hand, <strong>present tense</strong> only combines <em>present time</em> with <em>basic aspect</em>, describing things that are happening right this instance. It doesn’t emphasise that they are currently progressing or ongoing, but it also is not used for habitual or universal statements.</p>

<p>The High Valyrian form that combines <em>present time</em> with <em>habitual aspect</em> or <em>universal aspect</em> is instead the <strong>aorist</strong>.</p>

<p>The universal aspect often carries with it overtones of finality, inevitability: if something is universally and timelessly true, it is inescapable. The advent of death is universally true—past, present, and future. It is inescapable. This adds a layer of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_modality"" rel=""noreferrer"">modality</a> to the statement, which in English is often expressed through the use of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_verb"" rel=""noreferrer"">modal verbs</a>. In the English translation “All men must die”, the modal verb <em>must</em> is used, which has two basic meanings:</p>

<ul>
<li>a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontic_modality"" rel=""noreferrer"">deontic</a> sense: ‘be obliged or duty-bound to’ (“I must go”, “You must try this sponge cake”)</li>
<li>an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemic_modality"" rel=""noreferrer"">epistemic</a> sense: ‘be logically or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alethic_modality"" rel=""noreferrer"">alethically</a> unavoidable’</li>

<p>Clearly, in the translation, the second meaning of <em>must</em> is used. It doesn’t really mean much in itself, but it emphasises that the statement is known to be unavoidably true. Leaving out the modal verb altogether would create a sentence in the simple present tense, “all men die”, which would still encode universal aspect and thus mean pretty much the same thing, just without stressing the inevitability quite as explicitly.</p>

<p>With all that, we end up with a situation that reflects pretty much exactly what <a href=""https://forum.dothraki.org/index.php?topic=354.msg2346#msg2346"" rel=""noreferrer"">‘Mad Latinist’</a> (see TheLethalCarrot’s answer for the actual quote) says:</p>

<p><strong><em>Valar morghūlis</em> is an aorist statement. The aorist combines timeless aspect with present time and is used to describe universal truths. Universal truths tend to have nuances of epistemic unavoidableness, which is frequently made explicit in English by adding the verb <em>must</em>. Thus, “All men must die” is a perfectly valid and literal English translation of High Valyrian <em>Valar morghūlis</em>.</strong></p>

"54878","What is the bank system in Game of Thrones and why is it legitimate to exist?","<p>Right now, I am in the beginning of the season 4. I haven't read the books themselves, but I understand that the series is pretty close to the original content.</p>

<p>What makes me curious is the financial system of the Seven Kingdoms. Here and there some unclear bankers are mentioned, those who actually support with gold all the rulers of the Seven Kingdoms. Do the books ever explain any of this in detail? When did this bank system came to reality, who made it legal, and why do the kingdoms tend to loan money from them?</p>

<p>It's actually not some natural institution. For example, in many real medieval kingdoms usury and interest were against the law. Was it true for the Seven Kingdoms in the past? If so, when did this change? It seems to me that the bankers actually are the main financiers of the war, since it brings them huge profits. But do bankers make any actual appearance in the books?</p>

<p>Since I was asked to be more specific about my questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Who produces the currency of the Seven Kingdoms? It's definitely not the Master of Coin, considering what I saw.</li>
<li>Is the currency centralized at all in Seven Kingdoms, or does each kingdom have its own currency?</li>
<li>Why do the kings prefer to borrow money from some bankers (i.e. to borrow from each other, since the bankers don't have any money of their own from the start) instead of getting rid of the bankers once and for all and issue their own coins?</li>
</ul>

<p>Bronn in season 2 put it out perfectly in his dialog with the Imp:</p>

It is considered highly foolish to trifle with the Iron Bank, where it is often said, <em>""The Iron Bank will have its due.""</em> If necessary, the Iron Bank will use its vast wealth to hire sell swords to get its money back, and has the power to support new Kings, thus changing the shape of the lands.</p>

<p>We also hear that</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>Ser Harys Swyft, the Master of Coin under Lord Regent Kevan Lannister, has written to the banks of both Pentos and Myr, to try and raise enough money to pay back the loans of the Iron bank.

</blockquote>

<p>Clearly banking is a very important part of the Known World. However we only hear of banks from the Free Cities of Essos. We do hear of other sources of loans. We learn that the Iron Throne is in a large debt to Tywin Lannister. It does not make clear the terms of the loan, but it is unlikely that Tywin will lend money without the potential for gain, whether through interest paid or promise of power.</p>

<p><strong><em>Update based on the  revised question</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Who produces the currency of the 7 kingdoms? It's definitely not the Master of Coin, considering what I saw.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't believe there's any mention of this, I'll continue looking.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is the currency centralized at all in Seven Kingdoms, or does each kingdom have its own currency?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a single unified currency throughout the seven Kingdoms. This consists of three coins: the Gold Dragon, The Silver Stag, and the Copper Star (7-pointed, representing the Gods). This was established after the unification of the Seven Kingdoms, following the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/War_of_Conquest"">War of Conquest</a>.</p>

<p>There is some slight exception to this, regarding the Iron Islands. The Iron Born (particularly the men) tend not to use money as much (“the Gold price”) and prefer only to trade the things which they took by force (“the Iron price”).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why do the kings prefer to borrow money from some bankers (i.e. to borrow from each other, since the bankers don't have any money of their own from the start) instead of getting rid of the bankers once and for all and issue their own coins?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a very complicated question, and you could ask the same of our world. If you start to dismantle the financial institutions, then you start to create many enemies. Banks have their money and power stored in many ways, and once you try taking apart one piece, the others will find retribution. It is mentioned that the Iron Bank of Braavos will be willing to incur losses, and hire sell swords to get their money back. It's all about reputation. If you believe that a bank will come back with swift retribution, then you might prefer to pay them.</p>

<p>There's also an issue with revolt. Once you start dismantling your own laws, regulations and institutions, this leads to anarchy. For a real world comparison, consider the revolts and rebellions surrounding <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_II_of_England#Conflict_with_Parliament"">Charles II</a> reign and his actions of dissolving parliament.</p>

"54936","Is the White Walker/Other that Samwell Tarly encounters of importance(high-rank)?","<p>My friends and I were conversing on Team Speak we all came upon this question.  Is it even mentioned in the books?  I know that he was important in the way of knowing White Walkers can be slain, but I am asking if he was of high-rank, or if he was known in a behind the scenes plot of something bigger in say, the current book?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","54944","<p>There's no canon explaining White Walkers, whether they have a society, how it functions etc. The only things we know are things that we've seen, such as that they turn dead humans into <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Wights"" rel=""nofollow"">Wights</a>, and they can be harmed by <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragonglass"" rel=""nofollow"">Dragonglass/Obsidian</a>, and by Valyrian steel. Anything else is just rumours and stories by people in Westeros, such as Old Nan.</p>

<p>According to Melissandre, the White Walkers worship a god known as the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Great_Other"" rel=""nofollow"">Great Other</a>. The only source for this is Melisandre, so it's certainly not given as fact. However considering the things we've witnessed from her (and Thoros/Dondarrion), and the fact that the series is titled A Song of Ice and Fire, I'm inclined to believe that she is correct. So assuming that she is, this would suggest that the White Walkers do have some sort of society, so there may be some form of hierarchy amongst them. As to whether or not the White Walker in question is of importance, that's impossible to say.</p>

<p><strong>So in short, no we don't know anything about White Walker society and hierarchy; so we don't know whether the one in question was considered important.</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Update based on season 4, episode 4</em></strong></p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>In this episode, something is revealed that isn't yet written in the books. Baby boys (human) are turned into White Walkers by an unknown White Walker, who is believe to be the <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Night&#39;s_King"" rel=""nofollow"">Night's King</a> due to a <a href=""http://io9.com/this-accidental-game-of-thrones-spoiler-just-changed-1568796246"" rel=""nofollow"">possible spoiler from HBO</a>. There's a number of things we can glean from this, which should give us more information.
<br>
<br>Firstly (assuming that the HBO spoiler is correct) we now know that the White Walkers have a king, and therefore a hierarchy. Whilst we still can't be certain, we can draw parallels between them and us. Considering that the White Walker that encountered Samwell Tarly was alone, when enemies were nearby, then we can assume that it wasn't high ranking. A King, Lord, General or other does not go out scouting alone. So it's likely that this particular White Walker was a scout, or something like a soldier (or perhaps even operating alone; we don't yet know if the White Walkers are all unified).
<br>
<br>However if all White Walkers come from human babies, then it stands to reason that there numbers won't be very large (this also makes sense with why they haven't been more brazen with their attacks; and why they convert wights). So in this regard, I'd say all White Walkers are important to them, as they don't have sufficient population numbers to afford to lose many.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So to summarise my hypothesis, I'd say that they are important due to their low population size, but not high-ranking within their hierarchy/society; probably a scout or something similar.</p>

"54986","Does Melisandre really worship R'hllor, or does she merely use that belief?","<p>As far as I know, there once was magic in Westeros, just as there once were dragons. For example the Wall is said to be built with the help of magic. I don't recall anybody sneering about it, but I get the picture that people ""know"" and ""acknowledge"" there once was magic.</p>

<p>When Stannis releases the Onion Knight they discuss the things they witnessed and Stannis concludes that the Lord of Light must be real. At least in the TV show, the discussion is concluded with a (probably rhetorical) question how all this can be if the Lord of Light wasn't real. I find it rather strange that people never even suggest the return of magic. (Especially after they seem to have established a very peaceful co-existence of monotheistic and polytheistic beliefs, but I'm straying ...)
With everything I think I know, I'd rather say with the ""church"" of the Lord of Light magic finds its way back into the world.</p>

<p>When Thoros of Myr told Melisandre, that the Lord of Light had brought back Beric Dondarrion from the dead 6 times, she was startled and said: ""you shouldn't have that power"". The interesting thing is, that for the half drunk Thoros, it is crystal clear, that he merely prayed and the Lord of Light did the work. Still, Melisandre seems to know that resurrection is something the priest does/did. To me it's clear, that she is more into everything concerning the Lord of Light than Thoros has ever been.</p>

<p>Could it be, that Melisandre is actually a witch who is very aware of it and the nature of her powers and merely uses the religion of the Lord of Light to train, explain and (re-)establish magic in the world, but doesn't actually believe in R'hllor?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><game-of-thrones><religion>","54992","<p>Firstly, let's address the ""witch"" issue. Melisandre certainly does wield magic. Her power is not just given from R'hllor, it's something she studied (along with all of the other Red Priests). Their belief is that the magic comes from R'hllor, as a gift to them, but they must still learn to wield it. So, depending on your definition, she is a ""witch"", whether she believes in R'hllor or not.</p>

<p>Why did she seem surprised that Thoros brought back Beric Dondarrion? Well Thoros was never particular pious, so he wouldn't have received many powers from R'hllor. This doesn't really bring her faith in R'hllor into question, just her faith in Thoros, which is understandable given his past.</p>

<p>What does suggest that she may just be a witch? We know that Melisandre is a <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Shadowbinder"">Shadowbinder</a>. We don't know much about them but the name would suggest that the power of creating a shadow comes from her other magic, not from R'hllor. Melisandre claims that these shadows are servants of light. Whether she believes this or not, is impossible to say.</p>

<p><strong>There's nothing in the books to suggest she doesn't believe in R'hllor, so any answer to the contrary can only be hypothesis and theory.</strong></p>

<p>Here's my personal theory on the R'hllor situation (<em>spoilered as it's based across the whole series</em>):</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>Stannis isn't the chosen one of R'hllor. There's evidence to support this. It's fairly well established that his sword isn't actually <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lightbringer"">Lightbringer</a>. Salador Saan says to Davos, ""that sword was not Lightbringer, my friend"", and Maester Aemon says to Samwell, ""The sword is wrong, she has to know that ... light without heat ... an empty glamour ... the sword is wrong, and the false light can only lead us deeper into darkness."" Lightbringer is said to be a sword made of living fire. The only time we've seen this is with Lord Beric Dondarrion, who has a sword that can become engulfed in flames. Couple this with the fact that Thoros keeps bringing him back to life, and I believe that the Lord Beric is the true chosen one of R'hllor. This would explain why Melisandre was so shocked. It didn't make her question her faith in R'hllor, it made her question her faith in Stannis.</p>

In Zoroastrian cosmogony, water and fire are respectively the second and last primordial elements to have been created, and scripture considers fire to have its origin in the waters. <strong>Both water and fire are considered life-sustaining</strong>, and both water and fire are represented within the precinct of a fire temple. <strong>Zoroastrians usually pray in the presence of some form of fire</strong> (which can be considered evident in any source of light), and the culminating rite of the principle act of worship constitutes a ""strengthening of the waters"". <strong>Fire is considered a medium through which spiritual insight and wisdom is gained</strong>, and water is considered the source of that wisdom.</p>

From the quotes on the Q/A we can clearly see Tyrion is highly intrigued by them and would like to see them all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A scribe, long dead,&quot; said Haldon. &quot;He spent his life traveling the world and writing about the lands he visited in two books he called Wonders and Wonders Made by Man.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An uncle of mine gave them to me when I was just a boy,&quot; said Tyrion. <strong>&quot;I read them until they fell to pieces.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>&quot;The gods made seven wonders, and mortal man made nine,&quot; quoted the Halfmaester. &quot;Rather impious of mortal man to do the gods two better, but there you are. The stone roads of Valyria were one of Longstrider's nine. The fifth, I believe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The fourth,&quot; said Tyrion, <strong>who had committed all sixteen of the wonders to memory as a boy.</strong> His uncle Gerion liked to set him on the table during feasts and make him recite them. I liked that well enough, didn't I? Standing there amongst the trenchers with every eye upon me, proving what a clever little imp I was. <strong>For years afterward, he had cherished a dream that one day he would travel the world and see Longstrider's wonders for himself.</strong></p>
<p>Lord Tywin had put an end to that hope ten days before his dwarf son's sixteenth nameday, when Tyrion asked to tour the Nine Free Cities, as his uncles had done at that same age.</p>
<p><sup>A Dance with Dragons, Tyrion III</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the same passage we can see that he has seen the Valyrian roads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Come moonrise, they were back in their saddles, trotting eastward under a mantle of stars. The old Valyrian road glimmered ahead of them like a long silver ribbon winding through wood and dale. For a little while Tyrion Lannister felt almost at peace. &quot;Lomas Longstrider told it true. The road's a wonder.&quot;</p>

<p>We also know he has <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/3577/58193"">visited the Wall</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The largest structure ever built by the hands of man, Benjen Stark had told Jon on the kingsroad when they had first caught sight of the Wall in the distance. &quot;And beyond a doubt the most useless,&quot; Tyrion Lannister had added with a grin, but even the Imp grew silent as they rode closer. You could see it from miles off, a pale blue line across the northern horizon, stretching away to the east and west and vanishing in the far distance, immense and unbroken. This is the end of the world, it seemed to say.</p>
<p><sup>A Game of Thrones, Jon III</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, I'm not sure what other Wonders he has seen/been too. He even actively turned down going to Qarth to see the walls.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We could sail to Qarth,&quot; Penny went on. &quot;The streets are paved with jade there, my brother always said. The city walls are one of the wonders of the world. When we perform in Qarth, gold and silver will rain down on us, you'll see.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Some of those ships out on the bay are Qartheen,&quot; Tyrion reminded her. &quot;Lomas Longstrider saw the walls of Qarth. His books suffice for me. I have gone as far east as I intend to go.&quot;</p>
<p><sup>A Dance with Dragons, Tyrion XI</sup></p>

  journey,"" but it also <strong>may reflect the difficulty of any journey in the
  Middle Ages</strong>. Replaced Old English faran. Related: Traveled; traveling.
  Traveled (adj.) ""having made journeys, experienced in travel"" is from
  early 15c. Traveling salesman is attested from 1885.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our concept of travel is very modern, and recent. Even in the 19th century when travel by train was possible, still most of the population didn't travel without good reason. The main reason for this was travelling was <em>really</em> expensive. Firstly you'd have to pay to get where you were going, then you'd have to pay for accommodation when you got there. 
Travel was only realistically possible for the rich.</p>

<p>Roll back to medieval times, adding to the expense you've danger. If you couldn't pay for armed guards you're at the mercy of everyone you meet on the road. You've to either pay for food and lodging or forage and camp as you go, which effectively halves your daily distance &amp; doubles your travel time. In medieval times it was completely the norm for people to be born, live and die of old age without ever venturing more than 10 or so miles from their home.</p>

<p>Given, in the west, how quickly we can travel from one side of the country to the other, and even travelling to the other side of the world is possible, it does seem unreasonable that people didn't move or travel, but it's only because we're looking through our ""affluent western reality filters"". If you go to parts of the developing world, you'll find people who ""don't travel"" and would be slightly bemused at the idea.</p>

<p>Consider, 40 or 50 years ago, lots of people left my country (Ireland) to find work abroad. People who were leaving for America, Canada &amp; Australia were often ""Waked"" (as in a funeral/celebration of their life). Yes it was a party, but the concept of ""wake"" was added because it was understood that those people would never return. While parents/siblings would receive letters, their wider family and acquaintances would never see or hear from them again, and it was like they'd ""died"".</p>

<p>We are incredibly lucky to live in this age of easy travel, it's only been around for 40 or so years. Roll back to the 18th century (introduction of rail travel) and before and try to imagine how difficult it was to get from Warsaw to London, through - for the time - heavily populated areas, over difficult, badly maintained roads, expensive coaches, dangerous sea crossings ... Contrast that with London to San Francisco, weeks long sea voyages, then wagon train across hostile country that could take months.</p>

<p>Also, the books give a better impression of distances travelled and the time spent on the roads and in the wilds. The travellers are knights or travel with guards, and are less worried than most about bandits. They are mostly landed gentry with money or have liege lords to give them travelling expenses.</p>

"122866","What do we know about Bran the Builder?","<p>We all know of the mythical and mystical character of Bran the Builder; we know he had magical power, he built the Wall, also Storm's End. But not much is known about how he got the power in the first place. Was he the creator of the Stark house?</p>

<p>Why doesn't anyone know more about him considering how powerful he was? And would anyone in the future/present Stark lineage be his avatar?</p>

<li>He raised the Wall of the north with the help of the Children of the Forest</li>
<li>He is written about in Maester Childer's <em>Winter's Kings, or the Legends and Lineages of the Starks of Winterfell</em></li>
<li>He 'learned to comprehend the speech of the Children', which 'is a tale in itself'</li>
<li>He is a legend from the Age of Heroes</li>
<li>He may also have built Winterfell and Storm's End</li>
<li>May have been a king or multiple kings of House Stark</li>
<li>He is (possibly) a descendant of Garth Greenhand and Brandon of the Bloody Blade</li>
<li>He (or his son) may have designed the fifth tower, which was 200 feet tall and made Hightower a great house</li>
<li>As a boy, he helped build a castle that defied the gales and storms of both the sea God and the goddess of the wind</li>
<li>From <em>A Storm of Swords</em>, he may have given the Nights Watch Brandon's Gift</li>

"55519","Who was responsible for Prince Joffrey's education?","<p>I think most of us will agree that Joffrey is the most annoying character in GoT. But it's not clear <em>why</em>.</p>

<p>Who was responsible formally for his education? The TV show seems to state that it was his mother, but I can't find a book reference that backs this up.</p>

<p>The question is; Are there any official tutors or mentors for the young Prince Joffrey? AFAIK from history, kings were generally too busy to raise their own children so there are usually specially hired teachers. <strong>Is there anyone officially a teacher or tutor of Joffrey in the GoT books?</strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","55545","<p>'Responsible for' and 'most influence on' are two different things. The Maester may have been formally responsible for Joffrey's education, but the relationship between mother and son in this case was far stronger. I can't find anything in the GoT book, but from the TV show witness the moment when Cersei essentially tells him to ignore everything but his own desires (from s1 ep3):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Someday, you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it.</p>

<p>And a minute later:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be.</p>

<p>If that's not putting him on the road to be an arrogant little bastard, nothing is. And of course, as king-in-waiting and member of the richest family in Westeros, he's spoiled beyond belief. The saddest part is that in this very scene he's showing regret and maybe a little fear and humility about the whole incident with the Stark girls, but Cersei beats that out of him and makes him believe it was all <em>their</em> fault instead. Mothering perfection. And the cherry on the cake: </p>

<p>It is evident that dragonglass can destroy White Walkers and the First Men had a lot of dragon glass.</p>

<p>Why would they banish them to the Lands of Always Winter and build the Wall to prevent them from coming back and then HOPE that they didn't return rather than just kill them off to ENSURE they never returned?   </p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","189868","<p>No one knows because no one knows what truly happened. The legends state the Battle for the Dawn was the last battle between the First Men and the Children of the Forest versus the Others. During this battle the Others lost and were sent fleeing.</p>

<p>How the Long Night came to an end is a matter of legend, as all such matters of the distant past have become. In the North, they tell of a last hero who sought out the intercession of the children of the forest, his companions abandoning him or dying one by one as they faced ravenous giants, cold servants, and the Others themselves. Alone he finally reached the children, despite the efforts of the white walkers, and all the tales agree this was a turning point. Thanks to the children, the first men of the Night's Watch banded together and were able to fight—and win—the Battle for the Dawn: the last battle that broke the endless winter and sent the Others fleeing to the icy north. Now, six thousand years later (or eight thousand as True History puts forward), the Wall made to defend the realms of men is still manned by the sworn brothers of the Night's Watch, and neither the Others nor the children have been seen in many centuries.</p>

<p>That's not to say they didn't try and kill all of the Others and their wight army but it's hard to always be 100% sure. And when you're against an army as strong as the Others and wights it's best to have a backup plan, in this case that plan was the Wall and the Night's Watch.</p>
<p>It's also worth pointing out that we don't really know much about the Others and so by extension the people of Westeros likely don't know much about them either. If you don't know much about them, you don't know where they come from and so you don't know how many of them there actually are.

  <p>Stannis pointed North ""There is where I'll find the foe I was born to fight"" <br><sub>p483 A Storm of Swords, 2:Blood and Gold</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stannis also had other reasons for going to defend Castle Black</p>

<ol>
<li>He wanted Jon to take Winterfell so that he would have a foothold in the North, the largest region in the kingdom. This enabled him to continue his fight beyond the wall while having someone he trusted as Lord of Winterfell.</li>
<li>By claiming the North it gave Stannis more legitimacy as he seen it. It also gave him access to valuable resources which he badly needed, especially more men.</li>
<li>Melisandre who also directed Stannis' thoughts and actions so she would've also persuaded him that he needed to go to Castle Black to defend it against the 
<em>God of Night and Terror</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>As to why the other professed ""Kings"" or Wardens didn't send anyone to help Castle Black can be explained as Broklynite states, that they were still fighting and if they weren't fighting then we were trying to rebuild. Everykingdom apart from Dorne had been involved in someway or another in the War of the Five Kings. So they needed to recoup their losses, rebuild their towns, castles and tend to their people and lands. Their armies would also have been short of men, therefore instead of sending men to Castle Black to help them, they needed to retain whatever men they had left for their own protection. Also there's a history of some regions, especially in King's landing, of looking down upon the Night's Watch and not really giving it much consideration. As we learn from Yoren (long, long ago) he is sent to retrieve prisoners from the many dungeons in Westeros who have the offer to take the Black, and who are the very lowest and worst of society.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dragons, <strong>like a bird</strong>, tend to imprint on whoever is present when they
  hatch, regarding that person as their parent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, can Bran control dragons?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><dragons>","134415","<p>The answer would be ""No He probably can't"". We can't answer this from Show canon because show has never mentioned an encounter between Wargs and Dragons. So we have to see the history in books.</p>

<h2>Examples of Wargs encountering dragons</h2>

<p>Only example of when wargs came face to face with dragons is when King <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jaehaerys_I_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Jaehaerys I Targaryen</a> and his consort <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Alysanne_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Queen Alysanne the Good</a><sup>1</sup> flew north to help the Night's Watch and defeated a host of wildlings, wargs and giants at wall. Pictured Queen Alysanne on Silverwing at the Wall, during the campaign<sup>2</sup>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oiRSEm.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oiRSEm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>No warg managed to control <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Vermithor"" rel=""noreferrer"">Vermithor</a> (Mount of Jaehaerys) or <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Silverwing"" rel=""noreferrer"">Silverwing</a> (mount of Alysanne). This is implied because if a warg had managed that, it would have been a huge event and must have been reported in chronicles of watch or some other record. </p>

<p>This would have also probably caused death of the dragon rider targeted by the warg since the logical move on part of the warg would be to make the dragon throw his/her rider off to the ground. But since nothing like this is reported, we can assume it never happened. </p>

<p>If trained and experienced wildling Wargs could not control dragons, we can assume untrained and green Bran can't either. </p>

<h2>Claiming/Controlling a dragon</h2>

<p>Still We do not know if skin changers can slip into dragons. Some may say Dragonlords of Valyria might have used some different sort of skin-changing for riding dragons because after a dragon was claimed by a rider, they both shared a bond and became aware of each other (e.g. <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dreamfyre"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dreamfyre</a> broke her chains when her rider Queen <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Helaena_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Helaena Targaryen</a> jumped from Red Keep to die). But that would be a weak argument. Bond with a dragon seems to be way different. </p>

<p>But anyhow, we know it for Blood-magic, which allowed Dragonlords to claim dragons. Everything the Valyrians accomplished is attributed to their knowledge of blood magic. </p>

<p>Dragons are not like horses, to be ridden by any man who desires. They only serve the person who is their rider e.g. Prince <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Joffrey_Velaryon"" rel=""noreferrer"">Joffrey Velaryon</a> was thrown to his death by <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Syrax"" rel=""noreferrer"">Syrax</a> who was his mother <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rhaenyra_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Rhaenyra Targaryen</a>'s mount. Aegon the Conqueror flew Balerion but he never dared to mount dragons of his sisters; Vhagar and Meraxes. No Dragon rider has ever claimed two dragons. </p>

<p>All three of Daenerys's dragons were unclaimed previously. Daenerys has now claimed Drogon so he is unlikely to allow another rider until Daenerys lives. Rhaegel and Viserion are however up for taking.</p>

<p>If Bran was trained and knew how to slip into a dragon, we don't know what would have happened. Historically, only people with Valyrian blood have ridden a dragon. But anyhow, Bran does not share a bond with the dragons unlike his wolf (Daenerys did, her dragons could feel her rage &amp; her being in danger and act accordingly). So it is unlikely he could control a dragon. But since as the new Green-seer, Bran would have more powers than most Wargs, we do not know for sure if he can or cannot control a dragon. </p>

<p>We do not know yet what the origin of the Others is. Some characters speculate that they appear in the coldest winters, and they seem to be related to ice and cold (probably the ""Ice"" part of the ""Song of Ice and Fire"" theme). They might or might not be related to the resurgence of magic in the world, but we at least know they predate the birth of the dragons, because we're shown an encounter with the Others in the prologue, before Daenerys' eggs hatch. I mention this because, in turn, some characters (e.g. the warlocks of Qarth) believe the return of the <em>dragons</em> brought magic to the world, but since we know the Others predate Dany's dragons, they must have been brought by a different kind of magic, if any.</p>

"56096","What's the deal with Shae? (Spoilers)","<p><strong>So my question:</strong></p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Later in the series Tyrion will find out that Shae is sleeping with Tywin, and kill them. As the season progressed it seems as they started at the point where Cersei learned about it and told Tywin at the feast. Though in the books Cersei didn't know anything about Shae, and certainly she didn't tell Tywin.  Clearly Tywin knew about Shae, and was sleeping with her.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How long was that going on?  Did he know from the start?  If not, when did he find out?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","56104","<p>I don't believe it is ever clarified <em>when</em> Tywin finds out about Shae.</p>

<p>There are a number of possible explanations that come to mind:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Tywin's spies managed to track her down.  Tywin certainly does not trust Tyrion, and it seems certain that he would have made efforts to keep an eye on his activities.  Tyrion went to a lot of effort to hide her presence, but he started to get sloppy as his feelings for her grew.  He knew that bringing her to live and work in the castle was a bad idea, and it may very well have been his (or rather, her) undoing.</p></li>
<li><p>Shae may have been working for Tywin since the very beginning.  She was introduced to Tyrion by Bronn, who claimed to have stolen her from another knight in Tywin's camp.  I don't believe Bronn ever revealed <em>which</em> knight, and when Tyrion asked Shae herself, she avoided answering directly, only saying that he was a ""small man"" and a minor figure.  It is possible that this was a lie, and that she was really ""taken"" from Tywin at the start.  It is even possible that Bronn was knowingly acting as an agent for Tywin in delivering her to Tyrion; he was unapologetically mercenary, after all.  If this is the case, then Shae would have been deliberately planted by Tywin as a spy, and returning to his bed once Tyrion was arrested would have been natural.</p></li>
<li><p>Varys may have revealed the truth, since he knew about Shae, and was convinced to provide very damning information as part of the testimony against Tyrion at Tyrion's trial.  </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Of the three, I think Tywin's spies finding out about Shae is the least likely; Tyrion is reasonably careful, and while Varys found Shae despite Tyrion's efforts, Varys' mastery of spying makes Tywin look like a child by comparison.  Once Varys entered into his alliance with Tyrion to help hide Shae, it seems very unlikely that any spies employed by Tywin would find out about the secret.</p>

<p>The possibility of Shae originally working for Tywin originally, and then being sent to Tyrion as a spy, strikes me as very plausible.  Clearly Tywin was not above sleeping with a whore, since Tyrion found her naked in his father's bed.</p>

<p>Still, my personal opinion is that Varys revealed her to Tywin.  In fact, I believe that the whole trial, and the subsequent events, were part of a deliberate setup by Varys. </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Varys testifies against Tyrion.  Yet it also seemed too easy for Jaime to convince Varys to help Tyrion escape.  Tyrion goes to Illyrio, Varys' partner, and then subsequently sent with ""Griff"" and ""Young Griff"" (later revealed to be Jon Connington and Aegon Targaryen) to support Daenerys Targaryen.  If this was Varys' goal, then providing evidence at the trial would be an excellent way for him to force Tyrion to flee from King's Landing, and to go where Varys wanted him to.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Futhermore:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Arranging for Tyrion to find Shae in Tywin's bed (notice that Varys doesn't argue too strongly against Tyrion going to find his father, and quite willingly provides directions on how to sneak in to his quarters) would potentially serve a double purpose for Varys: it would set Tyrion even more firmly against his father, encouraging him to support the Targeryon claim, and it might also prove an opportunity to remove Tywin from the scene altogether.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>After all:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>The fact that Varys later murders Kevan Lannister, and then explicitly explains that he did so to destabilize the Lannister rule, sow dissent between Lannisters and Tyrells, and therefore making the kingdom an easier conquest for the returning Targaryens, makes it quite clear that Varys would have needed to eliminate Tywin somehow.</p>

"56150","Where does Daenerys keep her dragons?","<p>I'm talking mainly about the TV series. </p>

<p>When the dragons were younger, she kept them in the cage most of the time (right?). Then they grew up a bit more, and they mostly stayed beside her. In the fourth season, we see that they are fairly grown (although not fully grown yet), they are not usually beside their mother, and they are more wild.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>So when did Daenerys decide not to put them in the cage anymore? (At
what age and size of the dragons?)</li>
<li>In the fourth season, why don't we see the dragons that much?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Related questions:</strong> For example, when Daenerys reached Meereen, where are the dragons? Are they always flying freely and to further places? Do they come back to their mother whenever they want? Can Daenerys call them when they are far away? Do they sleep beside their mother? </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> There might be more details in the book also. </p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><dragons>","56153","<h2>Real World Answer</h2>

<p>CGI at this level is <em>very</em> expensive. So rendering the dragons when they are not actively contributing to the plot would severely drain the budget. So we only ever see the dragons when we absolutely must. It's the same reason why we see so little of the Stark direwolves.</p>

<h2>TV Answer</h2>

<p>We don't know. They certainly seem pretty big during season 4, and may or may not be caged anymore during Daenerys' march. We do see them uncaged and hunting in the first episode of season 4, but we don't know if they are caged again afterwards. However it seems from the latest episode (Season 4 Episode 6):</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> That the dragons are now uncaged and are free to roam the land.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Book Answer</h2>

<p>During Daenerys' march they were always caged. However in the books they don't grow as fast as the in the TV show. Drogon, who is the largest, is described as being only as big as a dog during the attack on Astapor, so it's conceivable that they would still be caged.</p>

<p>But when Daenerys becomes queen of Meereen, the dragons are left to their own devices to hunt the countryside as they wish. </p>

<p>So, <strong>why are the Martells called Prince?</strong></p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","56165","<p>It should be noted that in the real world, in early European feudal societies, a prince wasn't necessarily the son of the king, but a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince#Prince_as_generic_for_ruler"">ruler of  a territory</a>. The word ""prince"" originates from ""princeps"", which makes no reference to kings or their sons.</p>

"56176","What are the rules of Trial by Combat in Game of Thrones?","<p>What are the rules, as specified in the canon, for a Trial by Combat.  </p>

<li><p>In what situation is a Prosecutor and/or Defendant allowed to nominate a Champion to fight for him/her?  </p></li>
<li><p>In what situation does the Defendant get a right to Trial by Combat?  </p></li>
<li><p>Is the Right to Trial by Combat merely a plea by the Defendant or his sole authority of the means of the trial, ie to say can the Defendants 
Trial by Combat option be authoritatively dismissed by the Prosecution &amp; Judges?  </p></li>
<li><p>Does the Prosecutor have a right to Trial by Combat if he/his Champion is an extraordinary Swordsman?  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Be generic as far as possible so that nobody is spoiled.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","56177","<p>A trial by combat is essentially requesting to be judged by the gods. Denying someone the request of a trial by combat is possible, but has severe political consequences, since it implies that the denier doubts the judgement of the gods. However, it seems that only highborns are permitted to request a trial by combat.</p>

<p>A Trial by Combat:</p>

<ul>
<li>May be requested at any point before or during a trial.</li>
<li>May be advised against, but even sovereign Lords and members of the Royal Family rarely even consider denying such a request outright.</li>
<li>May be fought by the parties themselves, but it is not unusual for either or both parties to choose champions to fight in their stead.</li>
<li>Ends when either party yields or is killed; or when the accuser takes back his accusation; or (presumably) when the accused declares himself guilty.</li>
</ul>

<p>Considering the religious aspect of the trial, the champion of the just cause should prevail. Denying a champion is declaring that person to be above the gods.</p>

<p>It is less grievous to deny a choice of champion if, say, the champion is unable to arrive for the trial in a reasonable amount of time, or is unfit to fight, especially if there are other champions more readily available to the accused. If the accused is a royal, the champion must be one of the Kingsguard.</p>

<p>This is prior to the events of the books/show:</p>

<p>Of course, some find loopholes. For example, Mad King Aerys proclaimed fire to be his champion when Ned Stark's father and older brother went to King's Landing to seek justice for the kidnapping of Lyanna Stark.</p>

"123550","Why did Tywin Lannister allow Jaime to join the Kingsguard?","<p>I can't imagine Tywin allowing his son Jaime to join the Kingsguard. Wouldn't he insist that Jaime stay at Casterly Rock, marry, have children, and carry on the family name? He certainly did not want Tyrion to become lord of Casterly Rock.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><character-motivation>","123562","<p>In <em>The World of Ice and Fire: The Untold History of Westeros</em>, it is noted that King Aerys and Tywin were close friends as boys, along with Steffon Baratheon. Being such good friends and a close confidant of Aerys, Tywin became the youngest Hand in the Seven Kingdoms at the age of 20. Through the years, as we are well aware, Aerys became paranoid and delusional, believing that his own son Rhaegar and close friends, most notably Tywin, were plotting against him. There are several reasons why Aerys believed this.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>His wife Rhaella, although giving him an heir in Rhaegar, had countless miscarriages and still births, until the later births of Viserys and Daenerys, while Tywin's wife Joanna bore him two healthy twins, Jaime and Cersei.</p>
</li>
<li><p>After being kidnapped and held captive at Duskendale by Lord Denys Darlyn, who wanted more autonomy, Aerys believed that Tywin and Rhaegar had deliberately held back in freeing him, hoping he would be killed so Rhaegar could ascend the Iron Throne.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Aerys was inherently jealous of Tywin. He hated how Tywin seemingly had everything that he didn't and at every opportunity sought to undermine and belittle him.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The greatest insult to Tywin came in 281 AC when Aerys appointed Jaime to the Kingsguard. As stated in <em>The World of Ice and Fire: The Untold History of Westeros</em>, p121</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ser Jaime was also Lord Tywin's heir, however, and carried all his hopes for the perpetuation of House Lannister, as his lordship's other son was a the malformed dwarf, Tyrion. Moreover, the Hand had been in the midst of negotiating an advantageous marriage pact for Ser Jaime when the King informed him of his choice. At a stroke, King Aerys had deprived Lord Tywin of his chosen heir and made him look foolish and false.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Tywin couldn't refuse his king appointing Jaime, as this insult possibly would have cost not only him his life but caused the complete downfall of House Lannister, which is what happened to House Darklyn. All Tywin could do was resign from his post as Hand and retire to Casterly Rock, which Aerys allowed him to do.</p>

"56216","Why did Tywin allow Shae to be a witness at the trial?","<p>I was thinking after the most recent Game of Thrones episode - it was clear that Tyrion was going to be found guilty anyway according to Tywin's plan. He drove Jaime into making the deal he was planning to make all along, which in turn would make Tyrion plead for mercy (as it was Jaime who was asking Tyrion to do that).</p>

<p>In my opinion the single thing that drove Tyrion over the edge and ruined Tywin's plan (to send Tyrion to the Wall and make Jaime produce offspring to continue the family line) was Shae's testimony to the court. I can't possibly believe that Tywin was not aware of the list of witnesses and of the effect Shae's appearance and words might have on Tyrion. </p>

<p>So the question is - why did he allow her to testify? Just to humiliate Tyrion even more? Why did he not consider the possibility that her appearance might enrage Tyrion and drive him to demand the trial by combat thus ruining the initial plan?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","56221","<p>I wouldn't necessarily go so far as to say his goal is simply to humiliate Tyrion.  Whenever there are recollections of Tyrion's past and his father's treatment of him, they seem to be in response to Tyrion's behaviors that his father considers antithetical to ""being a Lannister"" and seem to be extreme lessons to toughen him up.  </p>

<p>Tyrion lives his life in pursuit of base pleasures and takes very little seriously.  His father lives a humorless life in pursuit of solidifying the family legacy.  Though he blames Tyrion for his mother and despises his physical limitations, his treatment of Tyrion doesn't seem simply emotional and reactionary. </p>

<p>He's the same with Jaime and Cersei - his treatment of them is similarly to forge them into the Lannister image - it just isn't nearly as extreme.  His lesson with Shae is ""I told you not to fraternize with whores, you did, now I'll show you the consequences of your misplaced trust.""</p>

<p>Cruel lessons, but lessons nonetheless. </p>

<p>Another thing I thought of</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> His betrothal to Sansa Stark - she's by all accounts one of the most desirable girls in Kings Landing.  Pretty, a maiden, and most importantly, the perceived heir to Winterfell. If Tywin's goal was humiliation, he could've arranged a different marriage.  But Tywin cares about Lannister appearances first and foremost, so like the arranged marriages for Cersei and attempted one for Jaime, he sought out a suitable match befitting a Lannister.  No matter what he personally thinks of Tyrion, he wouldn't do anything just to humiliate Tyrion, and by extension the Lannister family.  His actions seem to have a purpose.  </p>

I vaguely recall a few times she expressed some regret that her father burned people alive, etc.  But she's also adamant that she's queen of Westeros and that's the beginning and end of it.  OK Robert started his Rebellion based on a false premise about Lyanna Stark, but the king on the Iron Throne was also mad.  The other houses including the Lannisters were mainly in it because Aerys II was mad. 
 Does anyone remember what's the most Daenerys ever said about the Rebellion being her own family's fault.  Has she ever mentioned anything about the King Slayer (Jamie Lannister) being justified, or she wants his head or what?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","190451","<p>I think the dialog between Barristan and Daenerys when he reveals his identity is telling in this matter:</p>

<p>She turned to Ser Barristan. &quot;You protected my father for many years, fought beside my brother on the Trident, but you abandoned Viserys in his exile and bent your knee to the Usurper instead. Why? And tell it true.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Some truths are hard to hear. Robert was a . . . a good knight . . . chivalrous, brave . . . he spared my life, and the lives of many others . . . Prince Viserys was only a boy, it would have been years before he was fit to rule, and . . . forgive me, my queen, but you asked for truth . . . even as a child, your brother Viserys oft seemed to be his father's son, in ways that Rhaegar never did.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;His father's son?&quot; Dany frowned. &quot;What does that mean?&quot;</p>
<p>The old knight did not blink. &quot;Your father is called 'the Mad King' in Westeros. Has no one ever told you?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Viserys did.&quot; The Mad King. &quot;The Usurper called him that, the Usurper and his dogs.&quot; The Mad King. &quot;It was a lie.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Why ask for truth,&quot; Ser Barristan said softly, &quot;if you close your ears to it?&quot; He hesitated, then continued. &quot;I told you before that I used a false name so the Lannisters would not know that I'd joined you. That was less than half of it, Your Grace. The truth is, I wanted to watch you for a time before pledging you my sword. To make certain that you were not . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;. . . my father's daughter?&quot; If she was not her father's daughter, who was she?</p>
<p>&quot;. . . mad,&quot; he finished. &quot;But I see no taint in you.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Taint?&quot; Dany bristled.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;I am no maester to quote history at you, Your Grace. Swords have been my life, not books. But every child knows that the Targaryens have always danced too close to madness. Your father was not the first. King Jaehaerys once told me that madness and greatness are two sides of the same coin. Every time a new Targaryen is born, he said, the gods toss the coin in the air and the world holds its breath to see how it will land.&quot;</p>
<p>Jaehaerys. This old man knew my grandfather. The thought gave her pause. Most of what she knew of Westeros had come from her brother, and the rest from Ser Jorah. Ser Barristan would have forgotten more than the two of them had ever known. This man can tell me what I came from. &quot;So I am a coin in the hands of some god, is that what you are saying, ser?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; Ser Barristan replied. &quot;You are the trueborn heir of Westeros. To the end of my days I shall remain your faithful knight, should you find me worthy to bear a sword again. If not, I am content to serve Strong Belwas as his squire.&quot;<br />

<p>Her initial reaction here is denial. At this point, she was not aware of what truly happened, using terms like usurper.</p>
<p>From this point on, she becomes more and more aware of what it means to be a dragon. The entire Meereenese plot was designed to emphasize this internal struggle. She wanted to be a good ruler, balanced and stable, but on the other hand, she has Targaryen blood, the blood of the dragon.

<p>&quot;I want to know. I never knew my father. I want to know everything about him. The good and … the rest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As you command.&quot; The white knight chose his words with care. &quot;Prince Aerys … as a youth, he was taken with a certain lady of Casterly Rock, a cousin of Tywin Lannister. When she and Tywin wed, your father drank too much wine at the wedding feast and was heard to say that it was a great pity that the lord's right to the first night had been abolished. A drunken jape, no more, but Tywin Lannister was not a man to forget such words, or the … the liberties your father took during the bedding.&quot;<br />
<sub>A Dance with Dragons - Daenerys VII</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point, her position has softened a bit. She is interested in her father, but still avoids the word &quot;bad&quot;, using &quot;the rest&quot; instead.</p>
<p>A Dance with Dragons ends with Daenerys finding her resolve, deciding that she is a dragon, that her words are &quot;Fire and Blood&quot;, that the dragon does not plant trees:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You took Meereen, he told her, yet still you lingered.</p>
<p>&quot;To be a queen.&quot;</p>
<p>You are a queen, her bear said. In Westeros.</p>
<p>&quot;It is such a long way,&quot; she complained. &quot;I was tired, Jorah. I was weary of war. I wanted to rest, to laugh, to plant trees and see them grow. I am only a young girl.&quot;</p>
<p>No. You are the blood of the dragon. The whispering was growing fainter, as if Ser Jorah were falling farther behind. Dragons plant no trees. Remember that. Remember who you are, what you were made to be. Remember your words.</p>
<p>&quot;Fire and Blood,&quot; Daenerys told the swaying grass.<br />
<sub>A Dance With Dragons, Daenerys X</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This suggests at very least that her own claim to the throne is still as strong as ever in her own mind. Admitting the toxic madness of Aerys II as a legitimate reason to remove him from power weakens her own claim. If she (only slightly) justifies the transition of power to the House Baratheon, concedes to her enemies. From that last scene it is clear that she is not ready to do that.</p>
<p>To recapitulate:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Barristan is the first to truly say it as it is, Aerys was mad. This is met by denial.</p>
</li>
<li><p>During the time in Meereen, Daenerys the denial goes awake, but towards the end of the books, she is not ready to really admit it yet, as we can see from her wording.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In her last scene, she resolves to go to Westeros to take up her claim. This does not go together with legitimizing the rebellion.</p>

"123914","Does the North know that Ramsay did not marry Arya?","<p>Roose Bolton arranged the marriage between his son Ramsay and the daughter of the former Lord Paramount of the North, Eddard Stark. But the Arya his son married is an imposter. Does he and the rest of the North know this?</p>

<p>This marriage is very important for him, because it solidifies his claim to the lordship. So outing his daughter-in-law wouldn't be very wise. He would also anger the Lannisters because he arranged the marriage with them. The outing would mean, that the Lannisters tried to cheat the North, it would also mean that they had to admit that they don't have any more hostages of the North.</p>

<p>But isn't there any lord in the North that would recognize the imposter, which is Sansa's childhood friend Jeyne, IIRC?</p>

<p>There should have been festivities that Arya took part in, so the lords should know her.</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","124031","<p>Some of them may have some suspicions, but they don't seem to really know. As pointed out in the comments, Theon is supposed to know Arya, so Bolton uses him as a witness to confirm Jeyne as Arya:</p>

<p>Theon Greyjoy had grown up with Arya Stark. Theon would have known an imposter. If he was seen to accept Bolton's feigned girl as Arya, the northern lords who had gathered to witness the match would have no grounds to question her legitimacy. Stout and Slate, Whoresbane Umber, the quarrelsome Ryswells, Hornwood mens and Cerwyn cousins, fat Lord Wyman Manderly... Not one of them had known Ned Stark's daughters half so well as he.

<p>Lady Barbrey might know about it, as she is one of the only one to truly support Bolton. But even her case is unclear. And Wyman Manderly seems to believe Jeyne is the real Arya, as the wedding is one of the reasons why he wants Davos to look for Rickon:</p>

<li>Lannister forces under command of Tywin Lannister</li>
<li>King Renly's forces, including a massive contingent from Highgarden </li>
<li>King Stannis</li>
<li>Balon Greyjoy's Ironborn (although they were focused on raiding, not the Iron Throne)</li>
</ul>

<p>How large was each of these armies?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","56896","<p>I would say: </p>

<pre><code>Renly &gt; Tywin &gt; Robb &gt; Greyjoy &gt; Stannis. 
</code></pre>

<p>I seem to recall some numbers being mentioned, such as Renly having 100,000, and Stannis 2,000, but the exact numbers are not really a good measure of the strength of the army. It is the quality of the men, their leader, their position etc. Like when Robb crushed Stafford Lannister's army at Oxcross, they had a lot of men, but they were raw recruits with a poor leader. Or when Ramsay's 700 riders used surprise to crush Rodrik Cassel's 2,000+.</p>

<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tywin_Lannister"">Tywin Lannister</a> has a large army of Westermen, probably of comparable size of that of Robb's army of northerners. Tywin is a shrewd and experienced leader. And he is probably one of the most feared lords in Westeros, because of his cruelty towards his enemies. He extinguished the houses Tarbeck and Reyne for challenging his leadership as lord of the Westerlands. Which means he killed them all, which is more horrible than it sounds. He also killed the Targaryen children during Robert's rebellion.</p>

<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Robb"">Robb Stark</a> has all the north and most of the riverlands, which is a sizeable army. Robb himself is inexperienced, though he won all of his battles. Robb has <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Brynden_Tully"">the Blackfish Brynden Tully</a> on his side, who is a formidable leader and strategist. </p>

<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Renly_Baratheon"">Renly Baratheon</a>'s leadership qualities were never really mentioned. He had, as far as I know, never lead men in battle before. But he did have the notorious <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Randyll_Tarly"">Lord Randyll Tarly</a> on his side, who is often mentioned as the best battle commander of them all. Renly has the support of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Tyrell"">house Tyrell</a>, who has one of the largest armies in Westeros, reportedly around 100,000 strong.</p>

<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Balon_Greyjoy"">Balon Greyjoy</a> has his ironmen, whose main strength is their fleet. On land, they would probably be quite insignificant compared to other armies, but on the sea, they are one of two major forces: the Redwyne fleet and the ironmen. </p>

<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Stannis"">Stannis Baratheon</a>, the outsider, the forever awkward man of iron (according to the Night's Watch smith <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Donal_Noye"">Donal Noye</a>), has the smallest army, ever growing smaller (disregarding the men he took from Renly after their meeting at Storm's End). He is feared, though, because he is relentless, just and an experienced battle commander. His core army consists of the men from his wife's house: <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Florent"">House Florent</a>. He is the rightful lord of the Stormlands, with Storm's End as his main seat, but Robert gave Storm's End to Renly, and gave Stannis Dragonstone (which previously was a Targaryen seat, commonly held by the heir apparent). And the lords of the Stormlands chose to follow Renly instead. The lords of the islands around Dragonstone follow Stannis, though they do not have a lot of men.</p>

<p>At a guess, I would put the numbers at </p>

<pre><code>Renly   100,000
Tywin   30,000
Robb    20,000
Greyjoy 10,000
Stannis 2,000

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>[Interviewer]</strong> Quick question - We have seen all of the seven kingdoms in action in one way or another except Dorne and the Vale. I am trying to get an understanding of the various strengths of the different realms. When Robb calls the Northern Banners he gathers a host of about 18 thousand men. How do Dorne and the Vale compare to this (I don't expect numbers, just general feeling)<br />
  <strong>[GRRM]</strong> I'd say these three kingdoms were roughly equal in the force they could assemble... but the north is much bigger, so it takes longer for an army to gather. And life is harsher there as well, so lords and smallfolk both need to think carefully before beating those plowshares into swords.<br />
  <strong>[Interviewer]</strong> I also gather that Highgarden is the most populated place (Renly mentions 40,000 men), with the Lannisters being next (two combined hosts in GoT seem to be about 35,000).<br />
  <strong>[GRRM]</strong> The Reach is the second largest domain (after the north), and the most populous and fertile as well. The westerlands are the richest, with all the gold and silver in those hills. Those two regions also have the greatest strength at sea, after the Iron Islands.<br />
  <strong>[Interviewer]</strong> Dragonstone appears to be the least powerful. The Riverlands and Stormlords appear to fall in the middle I imagine.<br />
  <strong>[GRRM]</strong> Dragonstone is last, agreed. The riverlands are rich and fertile and populous, but suffer from divided leadership and a lack of natural boundaries. The stormlands have lots of trees and rocks and rain.</p>

  <p> <b>Varys</b> “If there was one soul in King’s Landing who was truly desperate to keep Robert Baratheon alive, it was me.” He sighed. “For fifteen years I protected him from his enemies, but I could not protect him from his friends. What strange fit of madness led you to tell the queen that you had learned the truth of Joffrey’s birth?”
 <br /><br />
 <b>Ned</b> “The madness of mercy,” Ned admitted.
 <br /><br />
 <b>Varys</b>“Oh, indeed. Cersei gave him the wineskins, and told him it was Robert’s favorite vintage.” The eunuch shrugged. “A hunter lives a perilous life. If the boar had not done for Robert, it would have been a fall from a horse, the bite of a wood adder, an arrow gone astray … the forest is the abbatoir of the gods. It was not wine that killed the king. It was your mercy.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We find out later that</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Lancel Lannister, King Robert's squire, gave him the wineskins</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But how could the queen have given this order when the King - and presumably his squire - were already away from the city on the hunt?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","57130","<p>There's always the possibility I suppose of her sending a rider with the wineskins and a message for Lancel.</p>

<p>However, I believe Cersei (or her father) had already decided that Robert should die before he went on the hunt, and before Ned made his revelation. Ned Stark was already proving to be a troublesome thorn on the Lannister side. The Starks held Tyrion captive, and had Jaime on the run. I'm fairly certain they knew he was retracing Jon Arryn's steps when it came to the incest investigation. Assassinating Ned would invite too many questions (he wasn't old like Jon Arryn) so the only way to neutralize him would be to remove the ultimate source of his authority: King Robert. Joffrey Baratheon was old enough (but not too old) to be an effective puppet ruler, and he was a Lannister in heart if not in name. Once he was installed, the could simply dismiss Ned and replace him with Tywin without much in the way of political repercussions.</p>

"191186","What was Daenerys' third sacrifice for birth of her dragons?","<p>Daenerys paid for her three dragons with three lives<sup>1</sup>. Two are obvious i.e. Khal Drogo and Mirri Maz Duur.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Inside the tent Dany found a cushion, soft silk stuffed with feathers. She clutched it to her breasts as she walked back out to Drogo, to her sun-and-stars. If I look back I am lost. It hurt even to walk, and she wanted to sleep, to sleep and not to dream.
  <strong>She knelt, kissed Drogo on the lips, and pressed the cushion down across his face.</strong><br><sub><strong><em>AGOT - Daenerys IX</em></strong></sub></p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <p>The sun was going down when she called them back to carry his body to the pyre. The Dothraki watched in silence as Jhogo and Aggo bore him from the tent. <br><sub><strong><em>AGOT - Daenerys X</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Is it so far from madness to wisdom?” Dany asked. “Ser Jorah, take
  this maegi and bind her to the pyre.”</p>
  
  <p>“To the... my queen, no, hear me...”</p>
  
  <p>“Do as I say.” Still he hesitated, until her anger flared. “You swore
  to obey me, whatever might come. Rakharo, help him.”</p>
  
  <p>The godswife did not cry out as they dragged her to Khal Drogo’s pyre
  and staked her down amidst his treasures. Dany poured the oil over the
  woman’s head herself. “I thank you, Mirri Maz Duur,” she said, “for
  the lessons you have taught me.”</p>
  
  <p>“You will not hear me scream,” Mirri responded as the oil dripped from
  her hair and soaked her clothing.</p>
  
  <p>“I will,” Dany said, “<strong>but it is not your screams I want, only your
  life. I remember what you told me. Only death can pay for life.</strong>”<br><sub><strong><em>AGOT - Daenerys X</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The third one is ambiguous. </p>

<p>There was a horse that was burnt with Drogo and Mirri.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Rakharo chose a stallion from the small herd that remained to them; he was not the equal of Khal Drogo’s red, but few horses were. In the center of the square, Aggo fed him a withered apple and dropped him in an instant with an axe blow between the eyes</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>Bound hand and foot, Mirri Maz Duur watched from the dust with disquiet in her black eyes. <strong>“It is not enough to kill a horse,” she told Dany. “By itself, the blood is nothing. You do not have the words to make a spell, nor the wisdom to find them.</strong> Do you think bloodmagic is a game for children? You call me maegi as if it were a curse, but all it means is wise. You are a child, with a child’s ignorance. Whatever you mean to do, it will not work. Loose me from these bonds and I will help you""</p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <p>When a horselord dies, his horse is slain with him, so he might ride proud into the night lands. The bodies are burned beneath the open sky, and the khal rises on his fiery steed to take his place among the stars. The more fiercely the man burned in life, the brighter his star will shine in the darkness.<br><sub><strong><em>AGOT - Daenerys X</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Mirri clearly thought that the horse was being sacrificed to make the blood magic work. Her sole objection was that Daenerys did not know the spells to make it work, not that the horse was not a suitable sacrifice. That has been my view and interpretation.</p>

<p>But there are people who disagree and suggest that it was in fact Rhaego. Rhaego was sacrificed to save Drogo's life so is it possible to use him twice as a sacrifice? Some claim that Rhaego's soul was inside Drogo so killing Drogo actually counts for two sacrifices and the third one is Mirri. There are also some people who claim that it may have been Daenerys herself, even though she did not actually burn and die, her willingness to walk into the pyre counts as a sacrifice.</p>

<p>What I am seeking is something that George or his associates (w.r.t Books, not show) may have said about that, settling it once and for all, not stirring another debate on the most likely candidate. </p>

<h1>Oberyn is now a Faceless Man</h1>

<p>As to the smashing of the face, Ser Gregor ""The Mountain"" Clegane was a humongous man, he has a tremendous body mass as well as strength:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gregor Clegane is well known for his size, cruelty, and prowess in battle. Gregor is extremely tall (he is close to eight feet in height). He has ""massive shoulders and arms thick as the trunk of small trees."" Gregor weighs over thirty stone (420 lbs), nearly all of it muscle, making him <strong>near inhumanly strong</strong>. Gregor's strength allows him to wield a six-foot, two-handed greatsword with just one hand, giving him enormous reach while still wielding a shield. Such is the power of Gregor's strength that he has been known to hack men in half with just a single blow.<sup><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Gregor_Clegane#Character_and_Appearance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Jaime says of Cregor's strength:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robert had been stronger than him [Jaime], to be sure. The White Bull Gerold Hightower as well, in his heyday, and Ser Arthur Dayne. Amongst the living, Greatjon Umber was stronger, Strongboar of Crakehall most likely, both Cleganes for a certainty. <strong>The Mountain's strength was like nothing human.</strong><br /><sup><em>-A Song of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 1 - Steel and Snow, Chapter 21 ([Jaime III][3]).</em></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So when Gregor shoves his hands and the weight of his whole body onto a man's face, it is not implausible for him to do the damage that he did. Albeit there is slightly less of a demolition of Oberyn's entire head in the books, nevertheless the face was crushed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He thrust his free hand into Oberyn’s unprotected face, pushing steel fingers into his eyes. “Then I raped her.” Clegane slammed his fist into the Dornishman’s mouth, making splinters of his teeth. “Then I smashed her fucking head in. Like this.” As he drew back his huge fist, the blood on his gauntlet seemed to smoke in the cold dawn air. There was a sickening crunch.

  <p>Tyrion Lannister: Why did you come to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn?</p>

Swaddled them, rocked them, fed them at her own breast. Elia wouldn't let the wet nurse touch them. And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen... left her for another woman.

<p><strong>The fight between Oberyn and Gregor was not part of Tywin's plan</strong>, however it was out of his control. As the mother of Joffrey, it was Cersei who chose Gregor as champion. Additionally, Tywin didn't know that Oberyn would volunteer as Tyrion's champion. So the whole fight was out of his hands. Tywin (and everybody else) was surprised that Oberyn volunteered as Tyrion's champion. Nobody thought that somebody, especially a Prince, would volunteer to fight the Mountain, particularly to save Tyrion.</p>

<p>[A Storm of Swords:Fire and Gold Spoilers]</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> It was Mace Tyrell who turned to Tyrion and asked the question. “Do
 you have a champion to defend your innocence?”
 <br />
 “He does, my lord.” Prince Oberyn of Dorne rose to his feet. “The
 dwarf has quite convinced me.”
 <br />
 The uproar was deafening. Tyrion took especial pleasure in the sudden
 doubt he glimpsed in Cersei’s eyes. It took a hundred gold cloaks
 pounding the butts of their spears against the floor to quiet the
 throne room again. By then Lord Tywin Lannister had recovered himself.
 “Let the issue be decided on the morrow,” he declared in iron tones.
 “I wash my hands of it.” He gave his dwarf son a cold angry look, then
 strode from the hall, out the king’s door behind the Iron Throne, his
 brother Kevan at his side.
 <br />
 ...<br />
 <br />
 No matter what happened, Tyrion had the satisfaction of knowing that
 he’d kicked Lord Tywin’s plans to splinters. If Prince Oberyn won, it
 would further inflame Highgarden against the Dornish; Mace Tyrell
 would see the man who crippled his son helping the dwarf who almost
 poisoned his daughter to escape his rightful punishment. And if the
 Mountain triumphed, Doran Martell might well demand to know why his
 brother had been served with death instead of the justice Tyrion had
 promised him. Dorne might crown Myrcella after all. It was almost
 worth dying to know all the trouble he’d made.</p>

 “I will tell him that Ser Amory Lorch killed Elia and her children,”
 Lord Tywin said calmly. “So will you, if he asks.”

 “Ser Amory Lorch is dead,” Tyrion said flatly.
 <br />
 “Precisely. Vargo Hoat had Ser Amory torn apart by a bear after the
 fall of Harrenhal. That ought to be sufficiently grisly to appease
 even Oberyn Martell.”
 <br />
 “You may call that justice...
 <br />
 “It is justice. It was Ser Amory who brought me the girl’s body, if
 you must know. He found her hiding under her father’s bed, as if she
 believed Rhaegar could still protect her. Princess Elia and the babe
 were in the nursery a floor below.”
 <br />
 “Well, it’s a tale, and Ser Amory’s not like to deny it. What will you
 tell Oberyn when he asks who gave Lorch his orders?”

 “Ser Amory acted on his own in the hope of winning favor from the new
 king. Robert’s hatred for Rhaegar was scarcely a secret.”</p>

 “No.” He spoke the lie without hesitation, and never stopped to ask himself why he should.</p>

<p>Answers from the books or the series are acceptable.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","58699","<p>I think there are two primary reasons for both breaking it up and for being cruel about it. First, he wants to ensure that Tyrion doesn't attempt this kind of marriage again since the Lannisters can't marry commoners as they are nobles, Tyrion could potentially be useful for a political marriage, that sort of thing. Being brutal will make sure it doesn't happen again. Also, he wanted it to appear that Tysha was a whore rather than an honest girl to ensure that Tyrion did not trust other women.</p>

<p>Second, Tywin hates Tyrion for multiple reasons. First he has to put up with the shame of having a dwarf for a son. Second, it has been hinted that he is suspicious that he may not be Tyrion's actual father (because Aerys Targaryen was interested in Tyrions mother, Tyrion has non-typical features for a Lannister, genetic deformities run in the Targaryen line due to inbreeding) . Third he blames Tyrion for his mothers death.</p>

"58911","What title does the son of a lord have in A Song of Ice and Fire?","<p>I don't fully understand the system of titles in the ASOIAF series - referring to the books or the series equally - in terms of lords. Catelyn corrects a gaoler who uses the title ""Lord"" for Edmure Tully while Hoster Tully is alive in A Clash of Kings (bold emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Begging your forgiveness, m'lady, but <strong>Lord</strong> Edmure says no one is to see the Kingslayer without a writing from him, with his seal upon it.""</p>
  
  <p>""<em>Lord</em> Edmure? Has my father died, and no one told me?""
  ...</p>
  
  <p>""You will open the cell, or you will come with me to <strong>Lord</strong> Hoster's solar...""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, from this I understand that Edmure Tully isn't actually a Lord until Hoster Tully, Lord of Riverrun, dies. But what is Edmure's title? He wasn't knighted as far as I remember, so does he have any title at all while his father lives, as the first-born male? And while I understand that (spoilers for GOT) ...</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Robb Stark automatically becomes the Lord of Winterfell when Lord Eddard Stark dies (until he styles himself ""King in the North""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>... what about Bran and Rickon Stark? Do they have any titles, before or after this event? I seem to remember Maester Luwin addressing Bran as ""my prince"", but I may have imagined this, and if not may just be a term of affection than a tiele.</p>

<p>So basically I have two questions:</p>

<p>1) What title is given (if any) to the first-born male child of a Lord?</p>

<p>2) What title is given (if any) to any other children of a Lord?</p>

<p>Answers from the books or series are acceptable. Be sensitive of spoilers, of course.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","58926","<p>As with most things in ASoIaF, we're never given any clear explanation for their system of assigning titles -- the Westeros <em>rules of peerage</em>. We've seen this same issue pop up on this site many times, including <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/19910/why-is-cersei-commonly-referred-to-as-cersei-lannister-instead-of-cersei-bara/19928#19928"">Why is Cersei commonly referred to as &quot;Cersei Lannister&quot; instead of &quot;Cersei Baratheon&quot;?</a> or <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/38857/can-a-bastard-under-any-circumstance-become-a-lord-or-king-in-game-of-thrones?rq=1"">Can a Bastard, under any circumstance, become a Lord or King in Game of Thrones</a>. As with those other questions, since Martin seems to cleave pretty closely to medieval England for Westerosi society, we can make some very educated guesses.</p>

<p>In general, <em>any</em> member of a noble family would, upon reaching the age of majority, be entitled to be called Lord or Lady Whomever. Until the age of majority, boys would be called Master Whomever (e.g. Master Rickon or Master Tommon), which I believe we have seen in the novels as well. Underaged girls would usually get the honorific Lady anyway, as the direct counterpart to ""Master"" is ""Miss"", which isn't quite as formal.</p>

<p>The primary difference between the head of a House and his sons is that the actual Lord of a House, say Ned Stark, would be identified as any of the following, starting with the most formal: Lord of Winterfell, Lord Stark, Lord Eddard Stark, Lord Eddard. His son, however, is not entitled to either of the first two titles, only the last: Lord Robb Stark, or Lord Robb, so long as his father is alive.</p>

<p>There is, however, a key exception to this rule, and it's the one that Edmure Tully falls into. Namely, he's been knighted. From what I can tell, in the Westerosi rules of peerage, the title of ""Lord Tully"" would take precedence over the title ""Ser Edmure"", which in turn would take precedence over the simple title of ""Lord Edmure"". Thus, as long as Hoster Tully lives, his son is <em>Ser Edmure</em>, but upon Hoster's death, he would become <em>Lord Edmure</em>. That appears to be what Catelyn was chastising the gaoler about.</p>

<hr>

<p>As far as the comment about Brandon being a ""prince"", which I'm pretty sure was made at least once in the novels, that title would have been valid at any point after Robb declaring himself King in the North. As soon as the Stark's household and lesser sworn houses recognize Robb as their King, his brothers and sisters would immediately become Prince and Princess Whatever, as they would now be in line to inherit Robb's throne upon his death.</p>

"59129","Is this character a member of House Baratheon?","<p>I'm compiling a database of every named character in A Song of Ice and Fire. In <em>A Clash Of Kings</em>, Page 7 (Cressen's chapter,) he talks about:</p>

  <p>...old <strong>Ser Harbert</strong>, the castellan of Storm's End in those years.</p>

<p>No mention is made of Ser Harbert's last name - it's not clear at this point if he is a Baratheon.

<p>I'm no military strategist, but it seems to me that if your forces hold the strongest fortification in the history of the world, it behooves you to stay behind those fortifications and use them to your greatest advantage.</p>

<p>Why are the Night's Watch so insistent on ranging north and getting killed? Are they just bored of waiting and craving excitement?</p>

<p>Is it just a dramatic decision on the part of GRR Martin? If the Night's Watch were on top of their game, there'd be no story?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","59162","<p>I think the Night's Watch cannot defend the wall effectively any longer. </p>

<p>The wall is gargantuan and the number of ""combat capable"" Night Watchers is low. The Wildlings can scale the wall at any point and reach local superiority quite easily. This was even mentioned in the books - Wildlings are scaling the wall quite often.</p>

<p>So to defend the wall, you have to know where bigger attacks will happen. In other words: you need intelligence.
Without ranging, the Night's Watch would be blind, deaf and dumb: Widlings could concentrate their forces easily and defeat the very weak defense on the wall. 
With ranging, the night watch has a chance to detect such attempts beforehand and can concentrate it's forces.</p>

<p>Finally, the Mormont-ranging was done to prevent a huge army from attacking the wall. If it had succeeded, the Wildlings would have scattered and the wall would have been secure again.</p>

<p>The Night's Watch did not have nearly enough resources to do it's task, so it was doomed to fail.

"59165","Would the founder of a House use their own House name?","<p>Lann the Clever founded House Lannister, and King Durran Godsgrief founded House Durrandon (ancestors of the Baratheons,) but would you name them as ""Lann Lannister"" or ""Durran Durrandon""? It seems strange to me, and I can't find anyone else who does it. Yet they founded those respective houses. So the question is: should you apply the house name to their founders? Or should they stay Lann the Clever, and Durran Godsgrief?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","59193","<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> It's hard to know for sure, since all of the information we have from that time comes from legends and stories passed down by word of mouth(+), but I would say that it's highly unlikely that those two individuals would have ever been called ""Lann Lannister"" or ""Durran Durrandon"". Most likely, their House names did not become commonplace until long after those ""founders"" had died.</p>

<hr>

<p>For starters, it's important to note that the type of noble houses that exists in Westeros in the time of the novels is likely much different from the ones founded by legendary figures like Lann the Clever, or Durran Godsgrief. </p>

<p>The current form of nobility exists, in essence, at the pleasure of the King, and only the King can create new houses. In modern-day Westeros (like most of modern-day Earth), it's typical for even non-nobility to have a family name, and that would become the name of their new house. For example, Aegon I Targaryen created House Baratheon for his (rumored) half-brother Orys Baratheon, and Joffrey I Baratheon created House Slynt for Janos Slynt.</p>

<p>The houses you're talking about, on the other hand, like Stark and Arryn and Lannister, date back thousands of years, to the Age of Heroes, which leads to a few problems trying to figure out how they would have been named.</p>

<p>The first of those problems is deciding if they are even real people. According to Martin, these men are not supposed to be historical figures, but legendary archetypes of the ""old days"". When talking about Bran the Builder, building the Wall, Martin says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No one can even say for certain if Brandon the Builder ever lived. He is as remote from the time of the novels as Noah and Gilgamesh are from our own time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(From: <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/The_Wall"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/The_Wall</a>)</p>

<p>Even in-universe it's not clear how much of those stories are true, as Sam says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are archmaesters at the Citadel who question all of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if those people existed, we have no real records of how they came to ""found"" their houses, nor any idea of what the naming conventions in effect at the time were. One thing we never see, however, is any last name assigned to the prominent figures of that time. They are <em>always</em> identified by their sobriquet, like ""Bran the Builder"" or ""Lann the Clever"" (in this sense, ""Godsgrief"" was not Durran's last name, but rather a sobriquet.)  We certainly never hear them identified as Bran Stark(++) or Lann Lannister, which we can <strong><em>speculate</em></strong> means that the naming conventions at that time were probably much more primitive, and that those people probably pre-dated formal surnames.</p>

<p>We also have no concrete evidence to prove that those specific individuals <em>actually</em> founded the houses that claim to be descended from them. The concept of noble houses, IMO, seems out of place for that time period. What I think is probably more likely (though again <strong>purely speculative</strong>) is that current Great Houses were not literally founded by those legendary figures, but rather, by their descendants, using their ancestry to bolster support for themselves. </p>

<p>As an example, House Lannister claims to be descended from Lann the Clever ""through the female line"". That seems odd if, in fact, Lann himself has founded the house: they would simply claim direct descent from Lann himself. However, if we assume that Lann existed, but did not actually found his own house, we can speculate that Lann's descendants began calling themselves Lannister, in the same sense that many early real-world surnames were originally patronyms (the afore-mentioned Erickson, or the Gaelic MacDonald or O'Connell). At some point down the line, someone important married one of the Lannister women, and decided to take her name, and thus her connection to Legendary Lann the Clever, when forming his own House. </p>

<p>A similar chain of events would have led to the eventual formal founding of the other noble houses, some of which had patronymic surnames (Durrandon) and others did not (Stark, Arryn).  Either way, the people usually identified as the ""founder"" of those houses <em>would not</em> have used those surnames for themselves.</p>

<hr>

<p>(+) There is, apparently, a lot more backstory from that time period available in the now-defunct <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> role-playing game material, but I have never read any of that, and wouldn't consider it to be canonical, since ASAIK Martin had nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>(++) UPDATE: There is, apparently, a DVD extra on the Season 1 Box Set, called a ""Complete Guide To Westeros"", that does identify Bran the Builder explicitly as ""King Brandon Stark"". However, none of this content was written by Martin (rather, by a staff writer for the show), and since this is the <em>only time</em> that he's ever been given a surname, my instinct is to call this non-canon and ignore it. YMMV.</p>

"192384","Where is the Lannister fleet?","<p>The Lannisters have historically maintained strength on the seas, which is crucial for defending their coastline. Especially major trading hubs like Lannisport, and to defend the Rock herself, which cannot be besieged without a naval blockade.</p>

<p>We see the Lannister fleet in action during the Pre-Conquest <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aubrey_Crakehall"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lannister invasion of the Iron Islands</a> and the <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Burning_of_the_Lannister_fleet"" rel=""noreferrer"">Greyjoy attack on the Lannister Navy</a> during the Greyjoy rebellion. After that there is no mention of the Lannister fleet at all.</p>

<p>Later when Tyrion and Cersei devise their plans for the War of the Five Kings and the invasion of Dragonstone, neither of them considered the naval power of the West herself but the former considered using the Greyjoy navy and the latter relied upon the naval power of House Tyrell and her banners. </p>

<p>So where is the Lannister fleet? Is it too weak to be used in an offensive role, if it exists at all? Or did Tywin just forget to rebuild their power at sea, which is fairly unlikely.</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","192386","<p>George R.R. Martin shed some light on the Lannister fleet in correspondence with a fan.</p>
<p>The fan asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Mr. Martin, we found it peculiar that Tyrion considered the importance of the Greyjoy fleet in aCoK (when Balon's message reached him in KL), since he never thinks about the West's own naval strength and it's usefulness against the Starks.</p>
<p>So we began to doubt said strength.</p>
<p><strong>Did Tywin ever rebuild the Lannister fleet, after Euron burned it eight years ago?</strong></p>
<p><strong>And if he rebuilt it, did he ever appoint a permanent commander of this fleet?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>GRRM replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Yes, Lord Tywin certainly replaced the ships that were lost</strong>. [...]</p>
<p><strong>The lords whose lands abut the coast of the Sunset Sea all keep a war galley or three about for coastal defense</strong>, and of course those shores are home to scads of fishing boats as well. <strong>The Lannisters have a larger and much grander fleet, but we're still only talking about twenty to thirty ships, perhaps</strong>. To fight a major battle, they would call the ships of their various bannermen, just as Stannis summoned the lords of the narrow sea for the battle on the Blackwater.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, however, their ships would be larger and more formidable than the longships of the ironmen -- cogs, carracks, and war galleys of various sides, up to the great dromonds with scorpions and catapults on deck.<br><sub><a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/The_Lannister_Fleet/"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Citadel: So Spake Martin - Lannister Fleet</a></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So to summarise:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tywin Lannister indeed rebuilt the Lannister naval power to some extent.</li>
<li>The Lannister fleet numbered somewhere between 20 to 30 although those 20-30 ships would be much bigger and much more formidable than the Greyjoy Iron fleet.</li>
<li>Local lords with coastal holdings would maintain 1 to 3 War galleys (again bigger and more formidable than the smaller Greyjoy longships), which can be summoned by the Lord of the Rock. So assuming that the Lords of Crakehall, Crag, Fair Isle, Kayce, Banefort and Frostfires maintain some galleys, the total sum of Lannister naval vessels would be somewhere between 26-38 or 36-48. Lannisport is also a major trading hub so a number of ships could be commandeered from the merchants in case of necessity.</li>
</ol>
<p>As for why have the Lannister hadn't used their own fleet, I believe the following would be the reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Deploying the Lannister fleet elsewhere would leave Casterly Rock, Fair Isle, Lannisport etc vulnerable to invasion and raids from the Greyjoys.</li>
<li>Before the alliance with the Tyrells, the Lannister fleet might have had to fight the Tyrell fleet in order to pass through to the East Coast if they were seen by Tyrell watchtowers on the Shield Isles and elsewhere.</li>
<li>It would have been too risky and too expensive to move the Lannister fleet from the West coast to the East coast given the risk of battles and violent seas.</li>
<li>With the majority of the Royal fleet defecting to Stannis Baratheon, the Lannister fleet would have been outnumbered and possibly wasted in battle.</li>
<li>After the Tyrell alliance, Lannisters did not need to redeploy their own fleet to the East coast and relied on their allies' naval power instead.</li>

<p>How do they find their bearings to navigate their ships correctly to foreign and domestic ports? Do they sail along the coastline to navigate with the help of the land marks (Although that wouldn't work when sailing between continents) or do they navigate using the stars?</p>

<p>Davos is also very familiar with the stars and refers to them as smuggler's stars suggesting he used them for navigation back in his smuggling days. He also refers to some of the constellations by name.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A half moon was sliding in and out amongst thin high clouds, and Davos could see familiar stars. There was the Galley, sailing west; there the Crone's Lantern, four bright stars that enclosed a golden haze. The clouds hid most of the Ice Dragon, all but the bright blue eye that marked due north.

<p>Davos tells of how he knows the shapes of the coastlines, most likely having had sailed around them enough times and used them for navigation purposes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There's much I don't understand,&quot; Davos admitted. &quot;I have never pretended elsewise. I know the seas and rivers, the shapes of the coasts, where the rocks and shoals lie.

<p>He cleared his throat. &quot;You know your orders, Captain.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do, my lord. We are to follow the coast, staying always in sight of land, until we reach Crackclaw Point. From there we are to strike out across the narrow sea for Braavos. On no account are we to sail within sight of Dragonstone.&quot;</p>

<p>The following quote tells of a priest telling Victarion to use the coastline to navigate to find some ships to pillage.</p>

<p>Sailors also use Myrish lenses/far eyes which is essentially a telescope. These would have been used for various reasons such as scouting the enemy but they are also used for spotting land. As can be seen when Catelyn sails for King's LKanding.</p>

"126068","Did Tywin Lannister know Arya is not a commoner?","<p>While Arya was at Harrenhal with Tywin Lannister, he once corrected her about which people say ""my lord"", ""m'lord"" and/or ""milord"". As part of the discussion in <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/16722/7616"">this question</a>, there seems to be a common consensus, that Tywin (easily) figured out Arya is not who she claims to be.</p>

<p>I don't share this impression. I think Tywin believes Arya's story. I get to that conclusion because he never investigates any further, which I think he would have, if he hadn't bought her story.</p>

<p>There is a war going on between noble houses and if Tywin suspected an unknown (and therefore potentially hostile) noble close to him, I'm sure he would do something about it. However, I don't recall reading or watching anything about Tywin investigating Arya. To me, this draws a picture of Tywin just noticing this inconsistency about Arya, addressing it once, and letting go afterwards, because he is not curious anymore.</p>

<p>Is there any canon that proves Tywin is still suspicious about Arya? Or maybe canon showing he is certain he caught himself a noble in hiding and keeps her for fun?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","126071","<blockquote>
  <p>If you're going to pose as a commoner, you should do it properly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That one little sentence would seem to indicate he has figured it out. Tywin, it should be noted, is always shown as having a formidable intellect coupled with cunning and a chilling lack of empathy for others. That does not mean that he disregards their feelings; he knows that others feel, and uses their feelings to manipulate and, well, rule them. He is very, very, very good at what he does. Frankly, given the doofuses who have taken the throne, he probably would have been better than any of the others. Cruel when necessary but not otherwise, always cognizant of his responsibilities, and understanding that willy-nilly torturing and killing people is merely asking to be overthrown.</p>

<p>The point that I am trying to make is that for him, how Arya incorrectly addresses him is but one of many signs that he has penetrated her disguise. And they show this remarkably well in the show. A peasant would <em>always</em> keep their eyes averted, <em>not</em> speak up and out, not argue or disagree, not do all manner of things that Arya does. Combined with her way of incorrectly addressing him, it is obvious. The disguise works on others because people generally see what they want to see. And the high and powerful rarely see the low and weak, which is frankly one of the many reasons that most of them suck as rulers.</p>

<p>Twyin Lannister, however, is a ruler of a different breed. He actually pays attention to what is around him. Arya is either a peasant trying to appear to have come from noble origins (or something similar) or a noble trying to pretend to be otherwise. Given all the tiny mistakes and slip ups and attitude, the latter is more likely than the former.</p>

<p>This is especially true given that she is in a castle which was overrun, in which case the smart thing for any aristocrat would be to pretend to just be another peasant; generally, if one of the invaders thought she had a touch of noble blood, she might be killed outright just as a safety precaution. Arya is clearly not stupid, and therefore is trying to suppress rather than emphasize her background. She's is imperfect at it, but it functions.</p>

<p>Tywin knows that she isn't what she seems. And it amuses him to keep her as a pet. Had he known exactly who she was, I have little doubt he would have either held her prisoner or killed her without a second thought. But remember, Tywin is only cruel when he feels it necessary. A little girl clearly terrified and powerless who is nonetheless smart enough to keep quiet, maybe comes from a noble family which otherwise no longer exists, is not a threat and is unlikely to ever become one. Thus, there's no point in singling her out for cruelty.</p>

<p>Whereas Tywin finds himself surrounded by people who can't seem to see past the end of their noses. And Tywin, curiously, genuinely deeply loved his wife. Someone like him would seem to be incapable of loving a mindless yes-woman. So he knows and values a female intellect. And having a sharp mind around, that nobody else knows about or even properly really sees, sitting right in his pocket? A useful resource, and oddly a sort of friend for the friendless man. Someone to challenge his wits against, which is probably the closest Tywin gets to having a friend.</p>

<p>So, yes, it seems clear that Tywin knows that Arya isn't just some peasant. And it amuses him to draw her in closer rather than spurn her. If he could gain her trust, at the very least he would effectively create a very loyal spy that nobody else sees who could give him intelligent reports rather than just dumbly reporting conversation. Conversation is all well and good, but even better is someone who sneakily reads documents laying out even upside down while listening to a conversation. Tywin is arranging things such that all roads lead to advantage to him, a more or less trademark trait of his.</p>

<p>Edit: as an aside, it's a very drastic contrast with the book, where Arya serves Lord Bolton rather than Tywin. Bolton is terrifying because of his power and cruelty (flayed man sigil and all that) but is at least reeeeelatively stable (certainly compared to his son). So while he is somewhat unpredictable, so long as Arya is careful and quiet, she is probably relatively safe. </p>

<p>But with Tywin, her every word, every motion, they all betray her and scream what she is, if not who she is. It sets up a very different but I think much more interesting dynamic.</p>

<p>Tywin is not the only one who notices these things, by the way. The Faceless Man does as well. Part of her training of erasing her identity is to eradicate all of these telltale little traces of who and what she is, so hat in the future nobody can be able to detect her via such subtle cues.
Really going off here:
Which of course only further begs the question of how the faceless man ended up in the cage. He can change his looks and his actions at will, and appear to be someone else entirely. The only conclusion I can come to therefore is that he wanted to be captured. Why? Well, we know that people in this world receive messages from their respective gods. What if he was under instruction from his God of death, who wanted Arya as an acolyte for some reason to be revealed later, and this was done as a setup to gather Arya in? </p>

"126303","Tourney Rules in Westeros: Choosing Queen of Love and beauty","<p>This has been irking me for a while now. There is a brief over-view of tourney rules gathered from A song of ice and fire, The Princess and the Queen, The Dunk &amp; Egg series. I know there are following formats of Tourneys in Westeros by my research:</p>

<hr>

<h2>Melee</h2>

<p>Basically last man standing! A group of knights beat each other bloody with blunted swords, axes and other weapons. Alliances are formed, broken, reformed. The last man standing wins. (There is archery as well but lets just skip that)</p>

<h2>Jousting</h2>

<p>Here knights have a go at each other with wooden lances. The one who falls or gets disqualified for cheating or concedes defeat, loses.The loser forfeits his horse and armor to victor and must either give it up or ransom it back. There are two main types of Jousting. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Knights are paired against each other and gradually move on like a Football tournament. Victor of the final tilt wins the champion's laurel. Example would be Robert Baratheon's Tourney of the hand at King's landing.</p></li>
<li><p>Knights fight to defend the honor of a named ""Queen of love and beauty"". A certain number are declared as Champions while others must challenge them. If Champions win, they retain their place. If Challengers win, they take the fallen champion's position as a champion. At the end the Champion decides to either keep the reigning Queen of love and beauty or choose a new one. Examples would be tourney of Harrenhal and Ashford. </p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>My questions is:</p>

<p>In jousting format number 2, how do Champions decide who should be Queen of Crown and beauty? With five original champions of course choice would be simple as the nominated girl (original queen) would most likely be their sister, niece or cousin. But what happens when different Challengers become champions? Do the Champions then tilt amongst themselves to choose one final champion?</p>

<p>Rephrasing the above question with an example, In Jousting format 2, How can one champion decide who is to be QOLAB? Rhaegar single handedly decided that Lyanna shall be QOLAB at Harrenhal. How did he manage to convince other champions? Or did he have to defeat them too?</p>

<p>I know it appears too broad but I have tried to limit the scope by providing as much help with answers as I could.</p>

<p>This question has been split up into two to narrow down the scope as per community suggestions. Please follow <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/126308/tourney-rules-in-world-of-ice-and-fire-status-of-non-knight-participants-in-tou"">this link</a> to view the second part of the question.   </p>

<p>From TWOIAF Chapter ""<em>The Year of False Spring</em>"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Prince Rhaegar emerged as the ultimate victor at the end of the
  competition. The crown prince, who did not normally compete in
  tourneys, surprised all by donning his armor and defeating every foe
  he faced, <strong>including four knights of the Kingsguard</strong>. <strong>In the final
  tilt, he unhorsed Ser Barristan Selmy, generally regarded as the
  finest lance in all the Seven Kingdoms, to win the champion’s
  laurels</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are five Champions in total. </p>

<p>Rhaegar defeated four KG and many others. It is logical that some of those may have been Champions at the end. <strong>Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar were both champions simultaneously, that much is for sure</strong>. </p>

<p>In any case, the transcript refers to <strong>final tilt between Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen</strong>. If this was the final tilt, it means the champions at the end had tilts among themselves, from which Rhaegar and Barristan emerged as the best. In the final title Barristan Selmy lost and Rhaegar Won the Champion's laurels and right to crown the QoLaB. </p>

<p>It is however not clear when do Champions start jousting among themselves. Most logical assumption here would be that they start doing that once all the Challengers have had their day in the field and no one else is left to challenge the final five champions.</p>

"59831","In Game of Thrones, can a dragon be killed?","<p>Talking about grown dragons here -- I don't recall ever reading about how tough their skin is or what their fighting style is. (Do they just fly around breathing fire, or do they get down to business Skyrim-style?)</p>

<p>Most importantly, I want to know if <strong>anyone has ever killed a dragon.</strong> And if so, how? And if not, is there evidence of it being possible?</p>

<p>Please note that I'm looking for for facts <em>from the books</em> that show whether it's possible and whether it's been done.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><dragons>","59833","<p>Dragons are susceptible to physical injury, especially those involving sharp metal-pointed spears or arrows as well as injury from blunt trauma.</p>

<p>The 4th in the Dunk and Egg novella series ""<a href=""http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/The_Princess_and_the_Queen"">The Princess and the Queen</a>"" by GRRM contains a vivid depiction of the damage a dragon can receive:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hundreds fled in terror from her flames … but hundreds more, drunk or
  mad or possessed of the Warrior’s own courage, pushed through to the
  attack. Even at the apex of the dome, the dragon was within easy reach
  of archer and crossbowman, and <strong>arrows and quarrels flew at Dreamfyre
  wherever she turned, at such close range that some few even punched
  through her scales.</strong> Whenever she lighted, men swarmed to the attack,
  driving her back into the air. Twice the dragon flew at the
  Dragonpit’s great bronze gates, only to find them closed and barred
  and defended by ranks of spears.</p>
  
  <p>Unable to flee, Dreamfyre returned to the attack, savaging her
  tormenters until the sands of the pit were strewn with charred
  corpses, and the very air was thick with smoke and the smell of burned
  flesh, yet still the spears and arrows flew. <strong>The end came when a
  crossbow bolt nicked one of the dragon’s eyes.</strong> Half-blind, and
  maddened by a dozen lesser wounds, Dreamfyre spread her wings and flew
  straight up at the great dome above in a last desperate attempt to
  break into the open sky. Already weakened by blasts of dragonflame,
  the dome cracked under the force of impact, and a moment later half of
  it came tumbling down, <strong>crushing both dragon and dragonslayers under
  tons of broken stone and rubble</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another was killed with a spear to the eye:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Morghul, it is written, was slain by the Burning Knight, a huge brute
  of a man in heavy armor who rushed headlong into the dragon’s flame
  with spear in hand, <strong>thrusting its point into the beast’s eye
  repeatedly even as the dragonflame melted the steel plate that encased
  him and devoured the flesh within.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and another with an axe to the head:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shrykos was the first dragon to succumb, slain by a woodsman known as
  Hobb the Hewer, who leapt onto her neck, driving his axe down into the
  beast’s skull as Shrykos roared and twisted, trying to throw him off.
  <strong>Seven blows did Hobb deliver with his legs locked round the dragon’s
  neck, and each time his axe came down he roared out the name of one of
  the Seven. It was the seventh blow, the Stranger’s blow, that slew the
  dragon, crashing through scale and bones into the beast’s brain.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another was apparently killed, either with a crossbow bolt but more likely with a grapnel:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Several differing tales were told afterward of how and why the dragon
  fell. Some claimed a crossbowman put an iron bolt through his eye, but
  this version seems suspiciously similar to the way Meraxes met her
  end, long ago in Dorne. Another account tells us that <strong>a sailor in the
  crow’s nest of a Myrish galley cast a grapnel as Vermax was swooping
  through the fleet. One of its prongs found purchase between two
  scales, and was driven deep by the dragon’s own considerable speed.
  The sailor had coiled his end of the chain about the mast, and the
  weight of the ship and the power of Vermax’s wings tore a long jagged
  gash in the dragon’s belly.</strong> The dragon’s shriek of rage was heard as
  far off as Spicetown, even through the clangor of battle. His flight
  jerked to a violent end, Vermax went down smoking and screaming,
  clawing at the water. Survivors said he struggled to rise, only to
  crash headlong into a burning galley. Wood splintered, the mast came
  tumbling down, and the dragon, thrashing, became entangled in the
  rigging. When the ship heeled over and sank, Vermax sank with her.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Out of Universe, GRRM intriguingly suggested that we may see a dragon-on-dragon fight at some point in the future; </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q.</strong> <em>Can a stag kill a dragon? More to the point, could any animal kill
  a dragon?</em> </p>
  
  <p><strong>A.</strong> <em>That remains to be seen, but perhaps...another dragon.</em></p>

<p>I do remember several times in the books when characters refuse it, often because they need to have their heads clear for some reason. I think the show creates the perception that everyone is always turning it down because when people take it in the books, it's usually mentioned in the narration; in the show, that all gets cut because it's not that important to the plot.</p>

"126308","Tourney Rules in Westeros: Status of Non-Knight participants in Tourneys","<p>Please see <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/126303/tourney-rules-in-world-of-ice-and-fire?"">this question</a> to build context. This question is to comply with community suggestions and to split  up a large question into different part. </p>

<p>Following up on what's already stated on the main question:</p>

<p>Since all the tourneys we know about have featured almost exclusively anointed knights, I will assume that Knighthood is required to be part of a Tourney.  (Yes I know <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Knight_of_the_Laughing_Tree"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lyanna Stark fought</a> in Tourney of Harrenhal despite not being a Knight but she did so by disguising as Knight of the Laughing tree. <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Storm_of_Swords-Chapter_67"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Barristan the Bold did it</a> as a boy but he was also disguised as a mystery knight). The wiki however suggests that some tourneys are exclusively for knights like <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tourney_at_Ashford_Meadow"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tourney at Ashford</a> and <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Wedding_tourney_at_Whitewalls"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tourney at lord butterwell's marriage</a> but that decision lies with the game master and lord hosting it I suppose.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>ASOIAF wiki says <strong>some</strong> tournaments are exclusive for knights. Does that mean a non-knighted person can appear in tilts if there is no such restriction? (I do recall something about <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jory_Cassel"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Northmen</a> from Winterfell fighting in <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Hand&#39;s_tourney"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hand's Tourney</a> lists but at least <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Alyn"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">one of them</a> was to be a knight, implying that he was a squire or near enough). Archery is open for all as we know, since <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Anguy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Anguy the Marcher</a> won archery tourney at KL.</p></li>
<li><p>Can a non-Knight appear in Melee? We have Thoros of Myr fighting in Melees with burning swords. Since he is not of the faith, we can assume he wasn't a knight. But was he? If Ser Jorah was knighted for <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Clash_of_Kings-Chapter_12"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">his role in siege of Pyke</a> despite being follower of the old gods, why not knight Thoros who was the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Game_of_Thrones-Chapter_27"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">first man through breach</a> in Pyke? And then he was part of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Brotherhood_without_banners"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Brotherhood without Banners</a> in which everyone was knighted (Which does not necessarily mean anything as he never rode in a tourney after he left KL on Lord Eddard's behest). Do we have any evidence supporting knighthood or lack of thereof of Thoros? Or any other example of non-Knighted person competing in a melee?</p></li>
</ol>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><laws>","131405","<p>After waiting for almost a month, I will begin this Self-answer with a statement from GRRM, which is quoted from <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Tourney_Rules"" rel=""nofollow"">So Spake Martin, entry for April 29, 1999</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was not so much a question of some king changing the rules, as you
  venture, as it was of the rules themselves being very variable.
  <strong>Medieval tourneys were never governed by a single set of rules or</strong>
  <strong>rulesmakers, like NCAA football or major league baseball or even</strong>
  <strong>(shudder) boxing. In essence, every tourney had its own rules.</strong> The
  lord or king who was staging the event would usually choose the format
  of the tournament in the broadest sense, and then appoint a ""master of
  the games"" to run the event and make all the ""fine print"" decisions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the same statement, Martin said this about Tourney of Kingslanding by Robert Baratheon:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Of the ones so far... well, the Hand's tourney at King's Landing was
  put together hastily, on Robert's whim, and so was relatively small,
  which allowed the single-elimination tilting format, which your
  opponents are chosen simply by the luck of the draw, and <strong>only one</strong>
  <strong>champion remains at the end</strong>. I also used the free-for-all
  last-man-standing style of melee, which did not exist in the real
  world so far as I know (melees were mock battles fought by teams), but
  which I thought offered juicy possibilities for a fantasy book.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now to answer the question:</p>

<ol>
<li>If there are no restrictions set by Game masters of the tourney, Non-knights can joust in the Tourney. <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jory_Cassel"" rel=""nofollow"">Jory Cassel</a> was not a knight but he jousted in <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Hand&#39;s_tourney"" rel=""nofollow"">Hand's Tourney</a> in Kingslanding. He defeated <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Horas_Redwyne"" rel=""nofollow"">Horas Redwyne</a> and of one the Freys before losing his seat to lance of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lothor_Brune"" rel=""nofollow"">Lothor Brune</a>, who wasn't a knight either. (Lothor was later knighted for valor in <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_the_Blackwater"" rel=""nofollow"">Battle of Blackwater bay</a>). So it is clear that Non-Knights can sign up for jousting if the rules do not explicitly forbid them to. </li>
<li>Melees can also vary in rules. Melees can be fought in ""Last-man-standing"" format or between teams of Knights fighting for victory. But there is precedent of a person who wasn't a knight but still fought in melee at a tourney. That character was Prince <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Maegor_I_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow"">Maegor Targaryen</a> (Later King Maegor the Cruel) who at age of 13 fought in a Melee and defeated adult Knights. Maegor was knighted three years later at age of sixteen by his father King Aegon the Conqueror, so it is evident that when he fought in the Melee he was not a Knight. In the World of Ice and Fire, there is mention of a <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/M%C3%AAl%C3%A9e_at_Last_Hearth"" rel=""nofollow"">Melee at Last Hearth</a> in North. Since Northmen usually do not have Knights, it is likely that most of the participants were not knights. Sadly I could not find anything on Knighthood status of Thoros of Myr. </li>
</ol>

<p>I will end this answer with another Quote from GRRM:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>As to your questions regarding the participation or non-participation of sellswords, squires, freeriders and the like,
  again, I don't see that as the difference as being chronological so
  much as geographic</strong>. The Reach is the heart of the chivalric
  tradition in the Seven Kingdoms, the place where knighthood is most
  universally esteemed, and therefore the place where the master of the
  games is most likely to devise and apply stringent rules. In Dorne and
  Storm's End and the riverlands and the Vale, things are perhaps a
  little less strict, and north of the Neck where the old gods still
  reign and knights are rare, they make up their own rules as they go
  along.</p>

"126367","Why are the nobles so powerless against the Faith Militant?","<p>It doesn't seem to make sense at all. The Faith Militant are clearly far weaker than any of the Great Houses let alone the Tyrells and the Lannisters. They've only just gained a militia, have negligible training and their troops are armed with robes and clubs. Powerful religious leaders are just like any other rulers: they have to have a powerful army at their backs. Why would Tommen allow the High Sparrow to block his access to the Great Sep, imprison the Queen, or Cersei allow herself to be paraded naked through the streets? This is unprecedented historically as well.</p>

<p>Tommen could cancel his decree to arm them and bring charges of treason against the High Sparrow. It may be unpopular with many people, but surely the reputations loss from letting these indignities continue would be far more damaging to his rule. If the Crown can't even intimidate this rabble, they can forget about the Seven Kingdoms. </p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","126371","<p>There are a couple of reasons:</p>

<p><strong>The Faith Militant has the support of the common people.</strong></p>

<p>The <em>true</em> strength of the Faith Militant is that it derives its legitimacy from the Faith of the Seven. To a commoner that means that they are the earthly tools of The Seven themselves, a much higher authority than any king. The nobles know that if they mess with the Faith Militant they will come off looking like heretics. The Sparrows movement arose <em>because</em> the commoners were fed up with the war killing off the clergy. When Queen Cersei gave them permission to arm themselves they became the second coming of the Faith Militant. Answerable only to The Seven (through their earthly representative the High Septon). Dismantling the Faith Militant would be a <em>very</em> difficult task for any king. This <em>threat</em> issued by the High Sparrow in the TV adaptation sums it up nicely (emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>High Sparrow:</strong> ""Have you ever sowed the field, Lady Olenna? Have you ever reaped the grain? Has anyone in House Tyrell? A lifetime of wealth and power has left you blind in one eye. <strong>You are the few, we are the many. And when the many stop fearing the few...""</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The Faith Militant has <em>history</em> behind it.</strong></p>

<p>This isn't the first time the Faith Militant have appeared in Westerosi history. When Aegon I conquered Westeros they were already a well established institution and a part of the Faith of the Seven. The Faith were reluctant to oppose Aegon, especially since he converted to the Faith of the Seven and declared himself to be its defender. This alliance ended when the Faith could no longer stomach the Targaryen custom of incestual marriage. The Faith Militant rebelled against the Targaryen in a war known as the Faith Militant Uprising. It was a long and bloody affair that claimed many lives on both sides, and only ended when King Jaehaerys I offered full amnesty in return for the Faith Militant disbanding.</p>

<p>However, in the television series, I've never seen the Dothraki display mercy to a defeated opponent. Even the tiniest dispute seems to be settled by combat to the death. I recently read the first book, and I recall a moment where a Dothraki questioned Ser Jorah's bravery because he wore armor. Ser Jorah insulted him back, they drew swords and Ser Jorah killed him. This seemed to be business as usual for the Dothraki.</p>

It was at this inn that he was first captured, and going to anywhere in the Seven Kingdoms coming from the Vale necessitates a stop there.</p>

 where he died, that in Daenerys's last chapter she notes that the
 Dothraki sea is going dry and the grasses are dying, two of the
 pyramids of Meereen collapse in smoke and ash following Viserion and
 Rhaegel rampaging through the city and that she menstruates (or
 possibly suffers a miscarriage). This of course leaves us the need for
 a living child, and then the ""return"" of Drogo... though our
 speculation is that if she has a child, it will be a son that she

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><names><laws>","60352","<p>tl;dr: </p>

<p><em>In theory</em>, a Westerosi knight gains is title when the knight he is squired to deems him ready, or when he does something to gain the favor of a lord or monarch (almost always militarily.)</p>

<p><em>In practice</em>, anyone can basically call themselves a knight, and as long as they look and act the part (which basically boils down to having a horse and armor), and people are willing to call them Ser, that's all that matters. The more well-known a knight becomes (serving powerful lords, having impressive military service, etc) the more likely people will be to accept the title at face value.</p>

<hr>

<p>Historically speaking, the term ""knight"" has evolved over the course of the Middle Ages to mean several very different things. Early on, a ""knight"" was essentially any well-equipped, mounted soldier fighting for his monarch, lord, the Church, etc. Over time, knighthood turned into a sort of minor nobility, and the title become more and more official. It was during this time that the concept of ""orders"" or knights that followed specific codes of conduct, and more generally the code of chivalry, gained favor. By the time of the War of the Roses (the period of English history that Westeros is roughly based on), knighthood was a very formal title, usually granted by the ruling monarch, Pope, or other very powerful political figure, and came with official documents (letters patent) granting the title. This is basically where things stand today, apart from the fact that the title is purely honorary, independent of any military service.</p>

<p>Westerosi culture seems to be stuck very early in this progression of knighthood, where there were no official orders of knighthood and no central authorities bestowing the titles on people. The title of Ser in Westeros seems to follow the same basic process as the craft trades: a potential knight is handed over to a current knight as a youngster to become a squire (an ""apprentice knight""), learning the craft until he gets good enough to be declared a knight of his own. In this sense, anyone who is currently recognized as a knight can declare their squires knights, in their own right, when they feel they are ready.</p>

<p>Of course, as this is basically the honor system, it's rife for abuse. No central authority ensures that the so-called knights meet any particular qualification, and there's no real set of rules they have to follow. Oddly, it seems that the popular <em>ideal</em> of chivalrous knights has arisen in Westeros, but without the practical reality of chivalrous orders to back it up. And, other than the ruling monarch stripping someone of their title (which I don't know that we've ever seen), once a knight, always a knight.</p>

<p>On the other hand, since being a knight has no ""official"" meaning in Westeros, people are conditioned to just assume any well-equipped, mounted soldier, especially one that serves under a king or lord, is probably a knight. And as long as people are willing to grant that title to those soldiers, and they are willing to accept it, that's about all that matters. This is why The Hound is so adamant that he's not a knight: he both looks and acts the part, so anyone meeting him will almost immediately assume he is one, until he claims otherwise.</p>

<ul>
<li>Where do they come from?</li>

<li>Are there any ""Giant Cities"" (civilizations) north of the Wall?</li>
</ul>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","126796","<p>We don't know that much about the giants' culture and origin, but the <em>World of Ice and Fire</em> does give us a little info, mostly about where they lived.</p>
<p>I don't think GRRM has mentioned exactly how they came to be (their origin story), and I cannot find anything relevant in any of the books. Also, the only name for their race we have seen so far is <em>giants</em>. There might be something else they call themselves in their own tongue, but we don't know.</p>
<p>On the chapter <strong>Ancient History: The Dawn Age</strong> there are quite a few mentions about the ways the giants used to live:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The giants had no kings and no lords, made no homes save in caverns or beneath tall trees</strong>, and they worked neither metal nor fields.</p>
<p><sub>Ancient History: The Dawn Age</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the book, there is also some mentions about the places the giants used to live (south of the wall), but people drove them away. Generally, some maesters believe that before the First Men came, Westeros belonged to the Giants and the Children of the Forest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Were the First Men truly first?</p>
<p>Most scholars believe they were. Before their coming, it is thought, Westeros belonged to the giants, the children of the forest, and the beasts of the field. But on the Iron Islands, the priests of the Drowned God tell a different tale.</p>
<p><sub>The World of Ice and Fire - The Iron Islands</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of the places that the giants are mentioned to have lived are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the hills in Westerlands (and more specifically the Castely Rock) (<sub><em>mentioned in The World of Ice and Fire - The Westerlands and  The Westerlands: Casterly Rock</em></sub>)</li>
<li>the Reach (<sub><em>The Reach: Garth Greenhand</em></sub>)</li>
<li>the Red Mountains (<sub><em>The Stormlands: The Coming of the First Men</em></sub>)</li>

<li>In The Grasslands (<sub>* Beyond the Free Cities: The Grasslands*</sub>)</li>
<li>In Ib (<sub><em>Beyond the Free Cities: Ib</em></sub>)</li>

<p>There is also another race of giants, named <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jhogwin"" rel=""noreferrer"">Jhogwin</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jhogwin were the stone giants of Dothraki legend. They were massive creatures said to have been twice as large as the giants of Westeros. They once inhabited the snowcapped northernmost region of the Bone Mountains in Krazaaj Zasqa or White Mountains in the Dothraki tongue, an area that is known as the Realm of the Jhogwin.

  <p>Jaime closed his eyes and let the wine and Qyburn do their work. “Tell me of the battle.” As keeper of Harrenhal’s ravens, Qyburn would have been the first to hear the news.<br />
  “Lord Stannis was caught between your father and the fire. It’s said the Imp set the river itself aflame.”<br />
  Jaime saw green flames reaching up into the sky higher than the tallest towers, as burning men screamed in the streets. I have dreamed this dream before. It was almost funny, but there was no one to share the joke.</p>

<p>I believe Jaime knew about the caches of Wildfire under King's Landing which the Mad King was wanting to light during the sacking of the city, so I'd be satisfied to believe that he's just saying ""I thought about this during the sacking of the city"", but before that I was wondering if there was any further evidence for or against the other possibilities:</p>

<p>A short while later Mance Rayder is burned upon the Pyre by Melisandre and Stannis.</p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","60933","<blockquote>

<p>You must bear in mind that we had no idea how exactly the bones came to be. <strong><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Drogon"">Drogon</a></strong> was said to have been responsible for them, but there are a few scenarios which this could have happened:</p>

<ul>
<li>he might have just been burning something nearby, or </li>
<li>might have just devoured the carcass, passing the bones (which were scorched due to the insides of the dragon being extremely hot, or</li>

<p><strong>Chains Were Made to be Broken</strong><br>
The metal chains were only truly to get the dragons <em>into</em> the pit, beyond that there was no guarantee that the chains would hold. In fact, <strong><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Viserion"">Viserion</a></strong> had actually broken through his:</p>

The bones on the floor of the pit were deeper than the last time she had been down here, and the walls and floors were black and grey, more ash than brick.

<p>Perhaps given time, they <em>could</em> burn through the walls/doors (but that's just conjecture).<br>
Take note also that there are a pile of bones. We don't know if they are scorched or not, but that definitely shows that an encounter with a dragon <strong>can</strong> leave bones behind!</p>

A younger son of Viserys Plumm, I’d wager. The queen’s dragons were fond of you, were they not?”<br />That seemed to amuse the sellsword. [Plumm:]“Who told you that?” <br />[Tyrion:]“No one.

"60899","Do unicorns exist in A Song of Ice and Fire?","<p>I was rereading certain chapters of <em>A Game of Thrones</em> and stumbled upon the following quote:</p>

  silver eagle of Seagard, Bryce Caron's field of nightingales, a
  cluster of grapes for the Redwynes, brindled boar, red ox, burning

<ul>
<li>Unicorns exist and are as common as horses and fish. This doesn't seem likely to me, since these are not mentioned as much as these animals.</li>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Prince Oberyn tells Tyrion about his visit a long time ago, and how cruel Cersei was to the little baby Tyrion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems like Cersei has the same tendency for cruelty as Joffrey himself. Is it true? What do the books specifically say about Cersei's psychology and behaviour, for example, in childhood, besides the story told by Oberyn?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","60967","<p>Cersei is <strong>not</strong> the primary source of Joffrey's cruelty.</p>

<p>The clearest evidence is that, in both books and TV series, her other children Tommen and Myrcella are portrayed as pleasant, intelligent and well-balanced individuals. Both are as ""normal"" as can be expected given their royal upbringing.</p>

<p>Also, Cersei's ""cruelty"" is not on the same level as Joffrey's. This becomes particularly clear in the book <em>A Feast For Crows</em>, in which</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> there are many chapters from Cersei's point of view, as she rules the seven Kingdoms as regent on behalf of Tommen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cersei is mean, petty, vindictive, insecure, and paranoid, but she is still mostly a sane and rational human being. Her cruelty is shown to originate from her fear and insecurity. As the audience, we may consider her behaviour evil but we can still understand it.</p>

<p>By contrast, Joffrey is a pure psychopath who inflicts pain simply because he enjoys it. There is no rational explanation for most of what he does.</p>

<p>A good illustration of the difference between Joffrey and Tommen is their attitude towards animals:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> In the book <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, we hear the story of how as a child, Joffrey killed a pregnant cat by cutting open her belly. Nobody encouraged him to do this, it was an early indication of Joffrey's own extreme sadism. On the other hand, in <em>A Storm of Swords</em> and later books, Tommen is shown as being particularly fond of cats and he would never harm one as Joffrey did.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The consequences of Joffrey's action are interesting. King Robert hit him so hard that one of his baby teeth was knocked out, but didn't follow up on the matter. Cersei was horrified by the injury to Joffrey and didn't take any interest in the reason why Robert had hit him. Joffrey seems to have learned he could get away with anything he wanted, as long as Robert didn't find out.</p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","61015","<p>There are two scientific organizations in Westeros:</p>

<h2>The Maesters of the Citadel</h2>

<p>These are people who have dedicated their lives to study, and discard their family names in an effort to shed past loyalties. They study a variety of disciplines including astronomy, meteorology, chemistry, medicine, economics, history, politics, smithery and even magic (though magic is mostly studied as an oddity for historic purposes). They are assigned to different lords to act as advisers, teachers and post masters. The Citadel is funded by taxes levied by the city of Old Town (where it resides) and by payments the lords of the realm make to the Citadel in exchange for the service of its Maesters.</p>

<h2>The Alchemists Guild</h2>

<p>Concentrating more on the chemical side of science, these people have been largely supplanted in importance by the Maesters. Their only claim to relevancy these days seems to be their monopoly on the creation of Wildfire, which is probably their only remaining source of funds.</p>

<h2>Technological Level</h2>

<p>There <em>is</em> a steady increase in technological know how in Westeros. The advent of the First Men (12,000 years ago) brought with it bronze technology, the Andals (2,000-6,000 years ago) brought iron. Though it does seem that it is quite slow by our standards.

<p>The only information we have about this is from the Histories and Lore videos as it is never expanded on in the show itself... that I can find. The full quote from the video you mention offers no explanation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was never supposed to be on the Kingsguard. Oh, as a boy, I dreamed of the white cloak like all boys. But I was heir to Tywin Lannister, Hand of the King. If he forbade the tides, the waves would cease. Then I was 15, and my father was congratulating me on my new knighthood in the Red Keep. I wonder if that was the last time he was proud of me.</p>
<p>That night, there was a knock on my door, and I'd opened it to find my sister Cersei disguised as a simple serving girl. I hadn't seen her since my father took her to court when she was 12. She had grown up. As had I. She told me that my father planned to marry me off to Lysa Tully. <strong>But she could arrange for the King to raise me to the Kingsguard so I could stay in the city with her. All I had to do was agree.</strong> I made the obvious objections. Our family, our father, Casterly Rock. Until she asked, &quot;Is it a rock you want, or me?&quot; Come morning, she had my consent. I would join the Kingsguard for her. I would forswear my lands and title for her. I would forsake our family for her.</p>
<p>Soon, a royal raven commanded my father to present me to the King during the Great Tourney at Harrenhal to say my vows. My father erupted in fury. He could not object openly, but he resigned the Handship and returned to Casterly Rock, taking Cersei with him. Instead of being together, Cersei and I exchanged places.</p>
<p><sub><em>Game of Thrones</em>, Histories and Lore, &quot;Robert's Rebellion&quot; (Jaime Lannister's perspective)</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even looking into the relevant passages in the books yields no further information, here is Jaime's POV thought process on what happened.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jaime, meantime, had spent four years as squire to Ser Sumner Crake-hall and earned his spurs against the Kingswood Brotherhood. But when he made a brief call at King's Landing on his way back to Casterly Rock, chiefly to see his sister, Cersei took him aside and whispered that Lord Tywin meant to marry him to Lysa Tully, had gone so far as to invite Lord Hoster to the city to discuss dower. <strong>But if Jaime took the white, he could be near her always.</strong> Old Ser Harlan Grandison had died in his sleep, as was only appropriate for one whose sigil was a sleeping lion. Aerys would want a young man to take his place, so why not a roaring lion in place of a sleepy one?</p>
<p>&quot;Father will never consent,&quot; Jaime objected.</p>
<p>&quot;The king won't ask him. And once it's done, Father can't object, not openly. Aerys had Ser Ilyn Payne's tongue torn out just for boasting that it was the Hand who truly ruled the Seven Kingdoms. The captain of the Hand's guard, and yet Father dared not try and stop it! He won't stop this, either.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But,&quot; Jaime said, &quot;there's Casterly Rock...&quot;</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Is it a rock you want? Or me?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>He remembered that night as if it were yesterday. They spent it in an old inn on Eel Alley, well away from watchful eyes. Cersei had come to him dressed as a simple serving wench, which somehow excited him all the more. Jaime had never seen her more passionate. Every time he went to sleep, she woke him again. By morning Casterly Rock seemed a small price to pay to be near her always. <strong>He gave his consent, and Cersei promised to do the rest.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A moon's turn later, a royal raven arrived at Casterly Rock to inform him that he had been chosen for the Kingsguard.</strong> He was commanded to present himself to the king during the great tourney at Harrenhal to say his vows and don his cloak.</p>
<p>Jaime's investiture freed him from Lysa Tully. Elsewise, nothing went as planned. His father had never been more furious. He could not object openly—Cersei had judged that correctly—but he resigned the Handship on some thin pretext and returned to Casterly Rock, taking his daughter with him. Instead of being together, Cersei and Jaime just changed places, and he found himself alone at court, guarding a mad king while four lesser men took their turns dancing on knives in his father's ill-fitting shoes.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3>Speculation time</h3>
<p>As nothing is known canonically that I'm aware of it is time for some speculation of what Cersei actually did.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Had an open conversation with the King</strong> - seems an unlikely route to take but it could have happened.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Spoke about Jaime and the Kingsguard near Aerys</strong> - this seems quite likely, she could have just planted the idea into Aerys' mind by talking about it near him.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Performed sexual acts for Aerys</strong> - certainly in keeping with Cersei and her going to great lengths to get what she wants but I'm not sure it would have happened.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Nothing</strong> - She could have overheard that Jaime was already in line to join the white cloaks or just assumed he would be.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Ask someone else to talk to the King</strong> - She could have approached someone else in court, perhaps on the Small council, and asked them to consider Jaime. This wouldn't have been too hard to do without Tywin finding out as it is very likely he had a lot of enemies at court and so they probably wouldn't have passed the information on.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>Now to answer your other questions. <em>Why are they so mad because of this?</em> Well the above quotes make it abundantly clear why:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cersei and Jaime rejected to it because they were now forced apart again and now on the context of not being able to be back together again.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tywin rejected because Aerys now removed his heir to Casterly Rock and replaced it with Tyrion - a dwarf that Tywin really would rather see anywhere but that position.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Was Rhaegar already married at this point?</em></p>
<p>Yes, Rhaegar was married to Elia in 280 AC and Jaime was appointed to the Kingsguard in 281 AC at the Tourney at Harrenhal. It is not exactly clear where in the timeline Cersei came to Jaime with the proposition but I believe he was already married at that point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Early in the year 279 AC</strong>, Rhaegar Targaryen, Prince of Dragonstone, was formally betrothed to Princess Elia Martell, the delicate young sister of Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne. <strong>They were wed the following year</strong>, in a lavish ceremony at the Great Sept of Baelor in King's Landing, but Aerys II did not attend.</p>

"127790","Who is the dual wielding kingsguard in the Tower of Joy scene?","<p>It appears half of internet is in consensus that dual sword wielder in the Tower of Joy scene is Arthur Dayne, sword of the morning. We know that the fight in the book was 7 vs 3, but in the scene it is 6 vs 2, one of the two being Arthur Dayne. However I noticed a few unsettling details:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the book, there are three kingsguards in the fight. One of them is the Lord Commander Gerold Hightower. Kingsguard is a military organization where rank would be respected utmost. It is conceivable that he did most of the talking.</p></li>
<li><p>We know from the books that Dawn is a greatsword. Very few can wield a greatsword single handedly. (Mountain is one of them.) We also know from the books that ""“And now it begins,” said Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. He unsheathed Dawn and held it with both hands. The blade was pale as milkglass, alive with light."" Hence, Arthur Dayne could not wield dual swords.</p></li>
<li><p>The scene starts with a close up to a sword, wielded by some curly haired kingsguard. Dawn is the most famous sword in the whole Westeros. It makes sense that the scene starts with a close up to the most famous sword.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Hence, it might have been Gerold Hightower. However, there are some unsettling details that contradict with my observation.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The last talking I quoted above is done by Arthur Dayne. He was wielding two swords in the scene.</p></li>
<li><p>Arthur Dayne should be the most skilled fighter of his age. An easy defeat doesn't fit his legacy.</p></li>
<li><p>Bran and Brynden seems to be talking only about one man. And at the beginning of their talk, they use the name explicitly as ""Arthur Dayne"".</p></li>
</ol>

<p><em>Edit: This is a pro list of the dual wielder being Arthur Dayne. Easy defeat refers to the death of the single sword wielder Kingsguard.</em></p>

<p>So my question is this: Is the dual wielder Arthur Dayne and the unsettling details I noticed are wrong, or is there no way to connect the portrayal in the series with the portrayal in the books accurately?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","127795","<p>It's Arthur Dayne. Gerold Hightower is bypassed for the show (I don't believe he's mentioned at all, even in the scene where Joffrey is reading from the White Book iirc).</p>

  <p>Note that the scene doesn't display an ""easy victory"". Dayne is basically a raid boss who goes into a 1v4 fight and kills 3 people. Ned Stark is shown to have a relatively easy time with the other Kingsguard, and he's shown to be hopelessly outmatched by Dayne. The fact that Howland Reed got a knife into the back is .... basically luck, and is a totally new addition. It's meant to enhance Dayne's legacy that it took that to defeat him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's entirely possible that Arthur Dayne dual-wields because Dawn is not made a big mention of in the show, so only book readers would find it a tease, and they wanted a 1v4. Dayne himself was made a big deal of in the show (in the scene with Joffrey and the White Book), but Dawn isn't really. It adds additional exposition to focus on it, when Dayne's legend is already built up.</p>

","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","127801","<p>Here's my stab at it. Spoilers obviously.</p>

<p><strong>A Game of Thrones</strong> introduces us to the slowly brewing conflict between the great houses over control of Westeros. For about the first half of the book it is all political intrigue with occasional flashes of violence, which slowly turns into a full on war later in the book, leading to... </p>

<p><strong>A Clash of Kings</strong> which chronicles the beginning of the War of the Five Kings. </p>

<p>The war reaches it's most violent peak in <strong>A Storm of Swords</strong>, and climaxes as House Lannister wipes the board clean of its competitors, declaring themselves the winner in all but name. But before the Lions can celebrate their victory tragedy strikes them as well.</p>

<p><strong>A Feast for Crows</strong>, just like the eponymous birds of carrion, deals with the aftermath of the War of the Five Kings. All the major participants in the war are bloodied and exhausted, even the Lannisters who are the nominal victors, and the other houses start to nibble at the corpses to gather political power of their own.</p>

<p><strong>A Dance with Dragons</strong>, which mostly runs parallel to AFFC deals with the dragon rider clan themselves: the Targaryens. Daenerys is fervently trying to consolidate her power, all the while her dragons threaten to become too big for their britches. Unbeknownst to her, many Westerosi are seeking her and not to assassinate her as per usual. Also, a man claiming to be Aegon VI lands in Westeros and starts carving a new Targaryen kingdom.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> They support Daenerys and Viserys Targaryen. Illyrio hosts them in his mansion for months and then marries Dany to a powerful Khal with an army that can help them regain the Iron Throne.

</blockquote>

<p>But it is interesting that according to <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Dance_with_Dragons-Chapter_5"">Chapter 5 of ADWD</a>, </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Illyrio says he had posted guards at Dany's door Viserys might have undone years of planning. Tyrion then comments that Viserys, ""Sounds an utter fool"". To which Illyrio replies, ""Viserys was Mad Aerys' son, just so.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So why do they support both of these people, if the one they favor has the weaker claim?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","63320","<p>The simple answer is: <strong>options</strong>.</p>

<p>Varys has shown that he is an effective, and devious long-term planner.  A large part of his strength in this regard is his ability to adapt to the current situation.</p>

<p>This is crucial to any long-term plans, particularly when it comes to political intrigue.  You can't just pick a plan and hope that nothing goes wrong between now and when you plan on implementing it (especially if it will take decades).  </p>

<p>Strategic board games like Go, Chess and Cyvasse are frequently used as an illustrative analogy for political machinations, and for good reason, as there are several parallels.</p>

<p>Aegon, Daenerys, and Viserys are all important pieces in Varys and Illyrio's game, but until recently, it was too early to bring them into active play.  Prior to that, their strategy was to create a favorable environment, to ready the playing field in such a way as to maximize the value of each of those pieces.</p>

<p>Viserys' weakness was apparent pretty early, but notice how he was used.  Illyrio arranged the wedding of Daenerys to a powerful military force.  Viserys' role was token, at best.  All he really contributed was that he legitimized Daenerys as a princess, making her a more attractive mate for Khal Drogo.</p>

<p>Aegon was actively trained as he grew older, to prepare him to be a useful and skilled asset and/or ruler.</p>

<p>If plans had progressed the way Varys and Illyrio set them up, there would have been two strong Targaryen claimants for the throne (Aegon and Viserys), and they would have been able to pick which was most suited for the situation.</p>

<p>Viserys could have been set up as a decoy, or even something like the Baron Harkonnen's strategy from <em>Dune</em>: Viserys could have been put on the throne, knowing full-well that he was dangerously unstable and would be a terrible leader, but then once the population of the Seven Kingdoms truly came to hate him, he could have been replaced by Aegon, who seems far more capable and charismatic.</p>

<p>However, Varys (and probably Illyrio, as well) is too careful to not account for chance.  He would want backups in case, for example, one of his Targaryen claimants proved dumb enough to provoke a Khal into dumping molten metal over his head.</p>

<p>Do we still consider Edmure's marriage to Roslin valid? After all, I'm not sure a man in his right mind would <em>want</em> to be married to the granddaughter of the architect of the Red Wedding.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","63368","<p>Yes, the wedding is presumably still valid... <strong>if</strong> it was actually consummated (i.e. Edmure and Roslin had sex).</p>

<p>As far as I can recall (and the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Marriage#Legality_and_Annulment"">Wiki of Ice and Fire</a> backs me up), marriage in Westeros generally requires the two participants to willingly exchange vows, and then consummate the marriage in bed.</p>

<p>A wedding that has not been consummated can be annulled.  I believe this came up with the marriage of Tyrion to Sansa, since he did not force her to consummate it.</p>

<p>However, failure to consummate doesn't mean they aren't married, just that it can be dissolved.</p>

<p>They clearly were brought up for the bedding ceremony, although I don't recall if there was any indication of what happened after they were stripped and thrown in the bedroom.  I recall that Roslin was distraught:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Poor Roslin's smile had a fixed quality to it, as if someone had sewn it onto her face.</p>

<p>and </p>

  <p>'To bed! To bed! *To bed with them!' Roslin had gone white.  Catelyn wondered whether it was the prospect of losing her maidenhead that frightened the girl, or the bedding itself.... Catelyn felt sorry for the girl. Most brides tried to return the banter, or at least pretended to enjoy it, but Roslin was stiff with terror, clutching the Greatjon as if she feared he might drop her. <em>She's crying too,</em> Catelyn realized...""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But fear of her grandfather would likely keep her from revealing anything to Edmure, and he certainly seemed willing, and unaware.  So it seems likely the marriage <em>was</em> consummated.</p>

<p>The vows were certainly exchanged, and exchanged willingly, so the circumstances of the later wedding... ""activities""... do not change the status of the marriage.  Only Edmure's opinion of his new family.</p>

<p>-Beric Dondarrion</p>

<p>I think that is what changes your personality. That unshakable feeling that you're not whole. He also experiences severe memory loss.</p>

<p>""Can I dwell on what I scarce remember? I held a castle on the Marches once, and there was a woman I was pledged to marry, but I could not find that castle today, nor tell you the color of that woman's hair. Who knighted me, old friend? What were my favorite foods? It all fades. Sometimes I think I was born on the bloody grass in that grove of ash, with the taste of fire in my mouth and a hole in my chest. Are you my mother, Thoros?""
-Beric Dondarrion</p>

<p>As for Lady Stone heart. She had been dead for a long time.</p>

<p>-Thoros of Myr</p>

<p>It is true that she  is vastly different from the person we know, but it is probable that she would have been just as crazed and vengeful if she had survived the Red Wedding.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>""However, death has changed Jon. Despite his honourable convictions and previous commitment to the Night's Watch, his experience being murdered by his own men and then revived has made Jon far more cynical and nihilistic.

</blockquote>

<p>-Game of thrones Wiki</p>

<p>This is likely for the same reasons Beric Dondarrion was different. He doesn't feel whole anymore. But also likely because he was bertrayed by the people he thought he  belonged to and is questioning the meaning of honour.</p>

<p>It is also not hard to imagine that death changes you in other ways. Feeling the life leave your body etc. and then being resurrected and realising that there is no other side, only darkness after death.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Both Beric and Jon attest to that.</p>

"63479","Why did Ned and Robert grow up under the care of Jon Arryn?","<p>It's mentioned that Jon Arryn was like a father to Ned and Robert, as he brought them up. </p>

<p>By why did they grow up with him?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","63481","<p>This is the Westerosi version of the medieval European practice of <a href=""http://www.ultimatehistoryproject.com/medieval-childhood-the-life-of-william-marshal.html"">fostering</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Later in their childhood, between the ages of 8 and 10, boys – and 
  occasionally girls, too – of knightly and noble status would be sent away to live 
  with another noble family for a few years in a custom called <strong>fostering.</strong> Sometimes 
  the foster family would be related to the birth parents; William Marshal fostered 
  with his cousin William of Tancarville. More often than not, though, foster 
  parents were chosen for political rather than familial connections. The royal 
  household was an especially prestigious place to foster; some royal households 
  had upwards of 100 young men and women in their care. </p>
  
  <p>Fostering helped young nobles make connections with other families while 
  training them in the skills they would need as adult members of the aristocracy. 
  Spending time with young people of a similar age and social class would – or so 
  their parents hoped – strengthen the political bonds among the next generation of 
  the nobility, and maybe even enable them to find a potential spouse. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Lord of the Vale, Jon Arryn was one of the most powerful noblemen in the Seven Kingdoms. On a personal level, he was well known for his wisdom and sense of honour. Therefore, he was a logical choice to foster the sons of similarly powerful families, such as the Starks and Baratheons.</p>

"128046","Who's King Roberts proxy between Jon Arryn and Eddard Stark?","<p>After Lord Jon Arryn's untimely demise, King Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, decides to make Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell, the new Hand of the King. He furthermore chooses to not just send a raven to summon Ned to court but travel to Winterfell with half the court, including the Queen and half her family as well as their children.</p>

<p>We also know that the distance between King's Landing and Winterfell is quite large, albeit the numbers are all but certain (Yoren of the Night's Watch claims it's 1,000 leagues).

<p>It is clear that King Robert was more interested in hunting and whoring than in ruling the kingdom and therefore let the small council run the realm in his stead. Still in those days there was Jon Arryn presiding the council, a man that King Robert would trust.</p>

<h2>Robert's Small council</h2>

<p>Small Council had following members at the time:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ser <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Barristan_Selmy"" rel=""nofollow"">Barristan Selmy</a>, Lord Commander of Kingsguard</li>
<li>Lord <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Petyr_Baelish"" rel=""nofollow"">Petyr Baelish</a>, Master of Coin</li>
<li>Lord <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Stannis_Baratheon"" rel=""nofollow"">Stannis Baratheon</a>, Master of Ships</li>
<li>Lord <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Renly_Baratheon"" rel=""nofollow"">Renly Baratheon</a>, Master of Laws</li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Pycelle"" rel=""nofollow"">Pycelle</a>, Grand Maester of the realm</li>
<li>Lord <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Varys"" rel=""nofollow"">Varys</a>, Master of Whisperers</li>
</ol>

<p>Any monarch would think twice before leaving his city in hands of other men but this small council was divided and thus was of no apparent threat to the King. Selmy was too noble for court intrigue. Baelish and Varys openly despised each other. Stannis disliked everyone and was disliked by everyone. Renly was charming but he did not particularly get on with Stannis and harbored his own ambitions of wedding Robert to Lord Tyrell's daughter Margaery. Pycelle was all alone.</p>

<p>As already suggested, it was the Small council which ruled in Robert's presence as well so it would not have been particularly difficult for the members to act without a formal hand or King to preside their proceedings. </p>

<p>In any case, it is not out of question that small council was in touch with Robert. Robert did stay in castles e.g. like he did in Castle Darry on his return trip. So ravens could possibly be sent to concerning castles for requesting instructions or for informing about administration issues. </p>

<h2>Who could have possibly presided over the Small council?</h2>

<p>So the question arises, who would have Robert appointed to head the administration while he was away? Following would be my reasoning:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Ser Barristan Selmy</strong>: The lord commander was a respected figure in the seven kingdoms and wasn't a man to indulge in conspiracies and court intrigue. Robert had liked the man which is evident by his appointment to Lord Commandership of Kingsguard despite fighting on the other side. But he can be dismissed instantly because he was sent by Small Council to receive King's party on their return which means <strong>he was not the one heading the administration</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Lord Varys</strong>: A foreigner and low-born, Varys was not viewed favorably by the people or the Lords. There were two brothers of King serving at the small council who would find it unacceptable to serve under a low born foreigner. Not to mention, Baelish would oppose Varys' command. Besides Robert had no particular liking for the man. He pardoned Varys and used him where he could but there is no indication whether he liked him enough. So on account of low birth and low public opinion, <strong>we can dismiss Varys as well</strong>. </li>
<li><strong>Lord Baelish</strong>: Great-Grandson of a foreign mercenary, Petyr Baelish was smallest of the small lords in the realm. Because there were better born men present on the small council, <strong>Baelish can be dismissed as well</strong>. Moreover, Varys would be opposed to his appointment. Stannis would be as well since he disliked Baelish for his support of corrupt Goldcloaks. </li>
<li><strong>Lord Stannis Baratheon</strong>: King's younger brother never shared a bond of affection with him. He was sour and prickly and was immensely disliked by Robert. Since Stannis ran from Kingslanding as soon as Robert left, <strong>we can dismiss the Idea that Stannis could have been running the realm while Robert was away</strong>. Furthermore, Renly would be opposed to his appointment. </li>
<li><strong>Lord Renly Baratheon</strong>: Charming and on good terms with his brother The King, Renly would be perfect for heading the realm while Robert was away. But we know he was sent with Ser Barristan to receive the Royal party from Kingslanding on council's behest so <strong>he could not be the one presiding the small council</strong>. And of course Stannis would oppose his appointment.</li>
<li><strong>Grand Maester Pycelle</strong>: Old, wise and experienced Pycelle is what we are left with then. He had been Grand Maester for forty years and thus had more experience of statescraft than any other member. He also did not have any open quarrel with any other member. And he was allied with Queen Cersei Lannister. So it is very likely that <strong>he could be the one leading the small council in this period</strong>. Robert had no particular reason to distrust Pycelle. Not to mention, Robert often gave Cersei what she wanted as long as he could get rid of her nagging. So if Pycelle was allied with Cersei, he would have her backing as well.</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p>As you have mentioned, it is legally possible to appoint an acting hand of King until the official/permanent one could take his place. It is also possible that Council may have been acting as a combined body acting through popular vote.  </p>

Little is known about this area and it receives only one mention in the book series (in A Dance With Dragons). It isn't seen or mentioned in the TV series: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This is Ny Sar, where the Mother gathers in her Wild Daughter,
  Noyne,” said Yandry, “but she will not reach her widest point until
  she meets her other daughters. At Dagger Lake the Qhoyne comes rushing
  in, the Darkling Daughter, full of gold and amber from the Axe and
  pinecones from the Forest of Qohor. South of there the Mother meets
  Lhorulu, the Smiling Daughter from the Golden Fields. Where they join
  once stood Chroyane, the festival city, where the streets were made of
  water and the houses made of gold. Then south and east again for long
  leagues, until at last comes creeping in Selhoru, the Shy Daughter who
  hides her course in reeds and writhes. There Mother Rhoyne waxes so
  wide that a man upon a boat in the center of the stream cannot see a
  shore to either side. You shall see, my little friend.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on the fact that the land runs alongside the river, we can assume that it is fertile. There's no special mention of its occupants but given the lawless nature of the land outside the Flatlands (and the fact that the nearest city has been abandoned) I think we can reasonably assume that the land is either unoccupied, or at most occupied by smallholding farmers.</p>

<p>The gold colour likely comes from wild grass or wild wheat that has spread over from the more populous <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Flatlands"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Flatlands</a> areas.</p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","128196","<p>If we are talking about dismissal as in honorable retirement package, Barristan Selmy would be the first.

<p>While there is no precedent for dismissing a kingsguard knight on physical incapacity, there are cases in which a KG was considered dismissed after he fled or after he broke his Sworn vows. Deserting and breaking your vows virtually amount to the same thing. Quoting Ser <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Gerold_Hightower"" rel=""nofollow"">Georld ""White Bull"" Hightower</a>, Lord Cmdr. of KG:</p>

His dismissal is implied by him being sent to the wall, because according to <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Kingsguard#History"" rel=""nofollow"">Vows of Kingsguard</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During his time as a member of the Kingsguard, a member is not allowed

</blockquote>

<p>So it is clear that you can't be a member of the Kingsguard and Night's Watch at the same time because that would be conflicting with Vows of both the orders. It is also proven because in the aftermath of Robert's Rebellion,  Ned Stark urged Robert Baratheon to send Ser Jaime Lannister to the wall so that he could no longer serve in position of a Kingsguard. Robert however did not heed to his advice and Jaime continued to serve as a KG. If Robert had listened to Eddard Stark, that would have ended Jaime's commision as a KG and opened a vacant post in the KG.</p></li>

"194600","How long were Daenerys' dragons locked up?","<p>How much time passes between Daenerys locking up her dragons, and Tyrion freeing them? Weeks? Months? Years?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><time>","194607","<h1><em>Game of Thrones</em></h1>
<p>The timeline in <em>Game of Thrones</em> is deliberately vague with events in the same episode in different areas sometimes being months apart. Whilst the unofficial timeline is one season = one year this doesn't really hold up when you look at some events between seasons. However, seeing as this is the best we really have I shall answer from that perspective.</p>
<p>Daenerys first chains up Viserion and Rhaegal in Season 4 Episode 10, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbXJuPVIxq4"" rel=""noreferrer"">&quot;The Children&quot;</a>, and Tyrion releases them in Season 6 Episode 2, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIbICzNrBo"" rel=""noreferrer"">&quot;Home&quot;</a>. They then break out of the catacombs in Season 6 Episode 9, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy9_-38j1Fo"" rel=""noreferrer"">&quot;Battle of the Bastards&quot;</a>. The links are to YouTube clips showing these events happening.</p>
<p>Looking at this it would appear that both dragons were locked up for somewhere in between one to two years. Though I'd imagine it is more likely somewhere between the lower half of that estimate.</p>
<h1><em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em></h1>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> We can't know for sure but estimates put it around 6 months.</p>
<p>Before we get into an answer based on the books there are two important things you need to remember. Firstly, sizes and times of locations and events in the books have been left vague on purpose as George does not want people obsessing over these things; that isn't why he wrote the books.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>[How big is Westeros? Is it the size of Europe, or even larger?]</strong></em></p>
<p>I have deliberately tried to be vague about such things, so I don't have obsessive fans with rulers measuring distances on the map and telling me Ned couldn't get from X to Y in the time I say he did.</p>
<p>However, if you really must know, you can figure out the distances for yourself. The Wall is a hundred leagues long. A league is three miles. Go from there.</p>
<p>But if you turn up any mistakes in travel times by using that measure, let it be your secret.</p>
<p><sub><a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Size_of_Westeros/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Westeros, So Spake Martin, Size of Westeros</a></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then when looking into the writing itself George believes in using the &quot;unreliable narrator&quot;. In the same way as when you look back in history events might not be described exactly the same as what happens, the same happens in the books. The chapters are told from the point of view of characters and so events may be mis-remembered or interpreted differently between characters and at different times.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was a long discussion about mistakes and inconsistencies. He used the eyes changing color example, and also mentioned receiving an email about horses changing sex. George gets frustrated when there's mistakes in the books--not just because mistakes can be embarrassing, though. He said there are inconsistencies in the books that are NOT mistakes. He believes in the &quot;unreliable narrator&quot; -- you can't always trust what people say because they might be remembering it wrong, or you get two different stories depending on who's doing the telling. He feels that mistakes such as eye color changes can distract from the planned inconsistencies, making them less effective.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>So when measuring times in Westeros we need to know a relative scale for how long a year/month is. Whilst we have no exact timing for a month except they are measured in &quot;moon turns&quot; (how long is a moon turn? We don't know, likely the same as ours though ~30 days), we do know a year consists of twelve moon turns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>[What is the cycle of a year? Why do they count years when seasons are strange?]</strong></em></p>
<p>Twelve moon tuns to a year, as on earth. Even on our earth, years have nothing to do with the seasons, or with the cycles of the moon. A year is a measure of a solar cycle, of how long it takes the earth to make one complete revolution around the sun. The same is true for the world of Westeros. Seasons do not come into it.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I have yet to properly double check, looking at other events in it, it does appear to be accurate, but <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZsY3lcDDtTdBWp1Gx6mfkdtZT6-Gk0kdTGeSC_Dj7WM/edit#gid=8"" rel=""noreferrer"">this timeline</a> for the whole series puts it around 6 months. <em>A Dance with Dragons</em> takes place solely in the year 300 AC so we already have an upper bound for the time they were placed in chains of a year.</p>
<p>Daenerys originally chains up Viserion and Rhaegal in &quot;Daenerys II&quot; of the book. The mentioned timeline puts this at the start of the year, the twentieth of the first month.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Viserion's claws scrabbled against the stones, and the huge chains rattled as he tried to make his way to her again. When he could not, he gave a roar, twisted his head back as far as he was able, and spat golden flame at the wall behind him. How soon till his fire burns hot enough to crack stone and melt iron?</p>
<p>Once, not long ago, he had ridden on her shoulder, his tail coiled round her arm. Once she had fed him morsels of charred meat from her own hand. He had been the first chained up. Daenerys had led him to the pit herself and shut him up inside with several oxen. Once he had gorged himself he grew drowsy. They had chained him whilst he slept.</p>
<p>Rhaegal had been harder. Perhaps he could hear his brother raging in the pit, despite the walls of brick and stone between them. In the end, they had to cover him with a net of heavy iron chain as he basked on her terrace, and he fought so fiercely that it had taken three days to carry him down the servants' steps, twisting and snapping. Six men had been burned in the struggle.</p>
<p><sub><em>A Dance with Dragons</em>, Daenerys II</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quentyn Martell later tries to tame and steal one of the dragons for himself, in the process they manage to escape; this happens in &quot;The Dragontamer&quot;. However, the dragons are seen to be free in &quot;The Queen's Hand&quot; by Ser Barristan Selmy having escaped during the aftermath of the previous mentioned event. The timeline puts this event at the fifteenth day of the seventh month.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He took his last shuddering breath in the bleak black dawn, as cold rain hissed from a dark sky to turn the brick streets of the old city into rivers. The rain had drowned the worst of the fires, but wisps of smoke still rose from the smoldering ruin that had been the pyramid of Hazkar, and the great black pyramid of Yherizan where Rhaegal had made his lair hulked in the gloom like a fat woman bedecked with glowing orange jewels.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Ser Barristan went out onto the terrace. The rain had stopped, though a wall of slate-grey clouds hid the setting sun as it made its descent into Slaver's Bay. A few wisps of smoke still rose from the blackened stones of Hazdar, twisted like ribbons by the wind. Far off to the east, beyond the city walls, he saw pale wings moving above a distant line of hills. Viserion. Hunting, mayhaps, or flying just to fly. He wondered where Rhaegal was. Thus far the green dragon had shown himself to be more dangerous than the white.</p>
<p><sub><em>A Dance with Dragons</em>, The Queen's Hand</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taking these times together the difference is 5 months, 3 weeks, 4 days from our calendar. This would then be ~6 months when we take into account an error margin and the fact that Westerosi months aren't exactly the same as ours.</p>

"194671","Was Brienne of Tarth a better fighter than Ser Jaime Lannister?","<p>I have not read the books.</p>

<p>In one of the episodes of season 2 of the TV series two guards are discussing who among Ser Loras, Ser Jaime and The Mountain is the better fighter. One of them claims Ser Loras to be the best, To which the other one replies ""He's been stabbing Renly Baratheon for years but he's not dead!"" - or something on that line - to which both of them burst out laughing. </p>

<p>In a separate scene (probably different episode) where Brienne of Tarth is introduced in the series she defeats Ser Loras in a melee which takes place in front of their king Renly Baratheon, as a result of which he makes her a member of his Kingsguard.</p>

<p>From the above two scenes I feel that Brienne is better than Ser Loras and probably Ser Jaime too.</p>

<p>Is it true? How is it shown in the books?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","194680","<p>No Brienne is not a better fighter than Jaime Lannister.</p>
<p>Brienne and Jaime fought each other while she was escorting him to King's Landing. Jaime at that point was handcuffed and starved for weeks yet he put up hell of a fight.</p>
<p>But Personally Jaime came to realise she was much stronger than him, while Brienne reached the conclusion that in a fair fight, Nobody stood a chance against the Young Lion.</p>
<p>This is how it went from Jaime's POV:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the blade slid from the scabbard, <strong>he was already pivoting,
bringing the sword around and up in a swift deadly arc</strong>. Steel met
steel with a ringing, bone-jarring clang. <strong>Somehow Brienne had gotten
her own blade out in time</strong>. Jaime laughed. “Very good, wench.”</p>
<p>“Give me the sword, Kingslayer.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I will.” He sprang to his feet and drove at her, the longsword
alive in his hands. Brienne jumped back, parrying, but he followed,
pressing the attack. No sooner did she turn one cut than the next was
upon her. The swords kissed and sprang apart and kissed again.
<strong>Jaime’s blood was singing. This was what he was meant for; he never felt so alive</strong> as when he was fighting, with death balanced on every
stroke. <strong>And with my wrists chained together, the wench may even give
me a contest for a time.</strong> His chains forced him to use a two-handed
grip, though of course the weight and reach were less than if the
blade had been a true two-handed greatsword, but what did it matter?
His cousin’s sword was long enough to write an end to this Brienne of
Tarth.</p>
<p>High, low, overhand, he rained down steel upon her. Left, right,
backslash, swinging so hard that sparks flew when the swords came
together, upswing, sideslash, overhand, always attacking, moving into
her, step and slide, strike and step, step and strike, hacking,
slashing, faster, faster, faster...</p>
<p>... <strong>until, breathless, he stepped back and let the point of the
sword fall to the ground, giving her a moment of respite. “Not half
bad,” he acknowledged. “For a wench.”</strong></p>
<p>She took a slow deep breath, her eyes watching him warily. <strong>“I would
not hurt you, Kingslayer.”</strong></p>
<p>“As if you could.” He whirled the blade back up above his head and
flew at her again, chains rattling.</p>
<p>Jaime could not have said how long he pressed the attack. It might
have been minutes or it might have been hours; time slept when swords
woke. He drove her away from his cousin’s corpse, drove her across the
road, drove her into the trees. <strong>She stumbled once on a root she
never saw, and for a moment he thought she was done</strong>, but she went to
one knee instead of falling, and never lost a beat. <strong>Her sword leapt
up to block a downcut that would have opened her from shoulder to
groin</strong>, and then she cut at him, again and again, <strong>fighting her way
back to her feet stroke by stroke</strong>.</p>
<p>The dance went on. He pinned her against an oak, cursed as she slipped
away, followed her through a shallow brook half-choked with fallen
leaves. Steel rang, steel sang, steel screamed and sparked and
scraped, and the <strong>woman started grunting like a sow at every crash,
yet somehow he could not reach her. It was as if she had an iron cage
around her that stopped every blow.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Not bad at all,”</strong> he said when he paused for a second to catch his breath, circling to her right. “For a wench?”</p>
<p><strong>“For a squire, say. A green one.”</strong> He laughed a ragged, breathless laugh.  “Come on, come on, my sweetling, the music’s still playing.
Might I have this dance, my lady?”</p>
<p>Grunting, <strong>she came at him, blade whirling, and suddenly it was Jaime
struggling to keep steel from skin. One of her slashes raked across
his brow, and blood ran down into his right eye.</strong> The Others take
her, and Riverrun as well! <strong>His skills had gone to rust and rot in
that bloody dungeon, and the chains were no great help either</strong>. His
eye closed, his shoulders were going numb from the jarring they’d
taken, and his wrists ached from the weight of chains, manacles, and
sword. <strong>His longsword grew heavier with every blow</strong>, and Jaime knew
he was not swinging it as quickly as he’d done earlier, nor raising it
as high.</p>
<p><strong>She is stronger than I am. The realization chilled him.</strong> Robert had been stronger than him, to be sure. The White Bull Gerold Hightower as
well, in his heyday, and Ser Arthur Dayne. Amongst the living,
Greatjon Umber was stronger, Strongboar of Crakehall most likely, both
Cleganes for a certainty. The Mountain's strength was like nothing
human. It did not matter. With speed and skill, Jaime could beat them
all. But this was a woman. A huge cow of a woman, to be sure, but even
so . . . by rights, she should be the one wearing down.</p>
<p>Instead she forced him back into the brook again, shouting, “Yield!
Throw down the sword!”</p>
<p>A slick stone turned under Jaime’s foot. <strong>As he felt himself falling,
he twisted the mischance into a diving lunge. His point scraped past
her parry and bit into her upper thigh</strong>. A red flower blossomed, and
<strong>Jaime had an instant to savor the sight of her blood</strong> before his knee slammed into a rock. The pain was blinding. <strong>Brienne splashed
into him and kicked away his sword. “YIELD!”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jaime drove his shoulder into her legs, bringing her down on top of him. They rolled, kicking and punching</strong> until finally she was sitting
astride him. <strong>He managed to jerk her dagger from its sheath, but
before he could plunge it into her belly she caught his wrist and
slammed his hands back on a rock so hard he thought she’d wrenched an
arm from its socket</strong>. Her other hand spread across his face. “Yield!”
She shoved his head down, held it under, pulled it up. “Yield!” Jaime
spit water into her face. A shove, a splash, and he was under again,
kicking uselessly, fighting to breathe. Up again. “Yield, or I’ll
drown you!”<br><sub><strong>ASOS - Jaime III</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So this is how it happened for Jaime. He began with utmost derision for Brienne and thought he could have beaten her even if he was chained at hands and starved. Brienne's fighting skills made him realise she was a good fighter <em>for a woman</em>. The dance kept moving and he then admitted that she was good enough <em>for a squire</em>. It was just before the end that he realised that she was stronger than him. Although I think he was actually so rattled to be bested by her that he forgot to really consider how much at a disadvantage was he. In an equal fight, as Brienne herself assessed, He would have killed her. Another curious thing to note is how Jaime appears to be in denial by the end, he believed it was not Brienne's skills but rather her strength and that his skills had gone to rust while imprisoned, that was making him lose. Holding off a Swordsman as skilled as Jaime, even at a disadvantage, requires a certain level of skill.</p>
<p>Brienne had (While noting the crucial factors that Jaime was weakened and handcuffed, severely limiting his moves) good reflexes, as Jaime noted happily in the beginning. She brought out her own sword and deflected Jaime's surprise attack just in time. She also had good defensive skills. She skilfully parried each and every attack Jaime launched in the beginning when Jaime was not tired. Nor did she lack for the resolve to keep fighting. Jaime's attack forced her to her knees yet she made her fall a renewed attack. Jaime pinned her against the trees and yet she escaped the deathblow. After that, it was her on the offensive and Jaime on the defensive. This was after all, how she was taught to fight.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ser Goodwin had taught her to fight cautiously, to conserve her
strength while letting her foes spend theirs in furious attacks. &quot;<strong>Men
will always underestimate you</strong>,&quot; he said, &quot;<strong>and their pride will make
them want to vanquish you quickly, lest it be said that a woman tried
them sorely</strong>.&quot; She had learned the truth of that once she went into the
world. <strong>Even Jaime Lannister had come at her that way</strong>, in the woods by
Maidenpool. If the gods were good, the Mad Mouse would make the same
mistake. He may be a seasoned knight, she thought, but he is no Jaime Lannister<br><sub><strong>AFFC: Brienne II</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She seems to be holding back a bit as she said she didn't want to hurt Jaime but that couldn't have possibly lasted for long given the ferocity of Jaime's attack. It could be a mixture of both her training and her oath that caused her to remain on the defensive for most part until she saw Jaime was completely exhausted.</p>
<p>Jaime came to give her the respect she deserved by the time they reached King's Landing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ser Loras edged around him. &quot;Are you a craven as well as a killer, Brienne? Is that why you ran, with his blood on your hands? <strong>Draw your sword, woman!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Best hope she doesn't</strong>.&quot; Jaime blocked his path again. &quot;<strong>Or it's like to be your corpse we carry out. The wench is as strong as Gregor Clegane, though not so pretty.</strong>&quot;<br><sub><strong>ASOS - Jaime VII</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brienne's own thoughts on the fight went like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brienne remembered her fight with Jaime Lannister in the woods. <strong>It had been all that she could do to keep his blade at bay. He was weak from his imprisonment, and chained at the wrists. No knight in the Seven Kingdoms could have stood against him at his full strength, with no chains to hamper him</strong>. Jaime had done many wicked things, but the man could fight! His maiming had been monstrously cruel. It was one thing to slay a lion, another to hack his paw off and leave him broken and bewildered.<br><sub><strong>AFFC - Brienne I</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brienne was better than most knights of Westeros but Jaime Lannister was not most Knights. He was one of those exceptional natural swordsmen who come about in a century or so. Ser Barristan Selmy thought so about Jaime and that says something.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of them had been training for the fighting pits when Daenerys
Targaryen took Meereen and freed them from their chains. Those had had
a good acquaintance with sword and spear and battle-axe even before
Ser Barristan got hold of them. A few might well be ready. The boy
from the Basilisk Isles, for a start. Tumco Lho. <strong>Black as maester's
ink he was, but fast and strong, the best natural swordsman Selmy had
seen since Jaime Lannister.</strong><br><sub><strong>ADWD - The Kingbreaker</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the show however, they made it look like as if Brienne was simply holding back to keep her oath and easily defeated Jaime whereas it was a very close thing in the books. Jaime fell when a slick stone got in the way, turned it into a lunge, drew her blood but then was disarmed by Brienne. That didn't stop the fight either, Jaime brought Brienne down with her and they had a fist-to-fist fight and Jaime almost drove her own dagger into her, which is when she finally overpowered him and the Brave Companions caught up with them.</p>

<p>As to how did that specific encounter between Brienne and Loras turned out in the books, this is how it went (The Blue Knight in the excerpt is Brienne):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The blue knight let his broken shield drop to the ground to free his
left arm, and then the Knight of Flowers was on him. The weight of his
steel seemed to hardly diminish the grace and quickness with which Ser
Loras moved, his rainbow cloak swirling about him.</p>
<p>The white horse and the black one wheeled like lovers at a harvest
dance, the riders throwing steel in place of kisses. Longaxe flashed
and morningstar whirled. Both weapons were blunted, yet still they
raised an awful clangor. Shieldless, the blue knight was getting much
the worse of it. Ser Loras rained down blows on his head and
shoulders, to shouts of “Highgarden!” from the throng. The other gave
answer with his morningstar, but whenever the ball came crashing in,
Ser Loras interposed his battered green shield, emblazoned with three
golden roses. When the longaxe caught the blue knight’s hand on the
backswing and sent the morningstar flying from his grasp, the crowd
screamed like a rutting beast. The Knight of Flowers raised his axe
for the final blow.</p>
<p>The blue knight charged into it. The stallions slammed together, the
blunted axehead smashed against the scarred blue breastplate... but
somehow the blue knight had the haft locked between steel-gauntleted
fingers. He wrenched it from Ser Loras’s hand, and suddenly the two
were grappling mount-to-mount, and an instant later they were falling.
As their horses pulled apart, they crashed to the ground with
bone-jarring force. Loras Tyrell, on the bottom, took the brunt of the
impact. The blue knight pulled a long dirk free and flicked open
Tyrell’s visor. The roar of the crowd was too loud for Catelyn to hear
what Ser Loras said, but she saw the word form on his split, bloody
lips. Yield.<br><sub><strong>ACOK - Catelyn II</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Renly did raise Brienne to the Kingsguard when she requested that honour as her prize. Some Tyrell men however claimed that Brienne's pulled a vile trick in pulling Loras down from his horse like that and it was no proper unhorsing.</p>

<p>What happened to him and his companions?</p>

<p>-- start --</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The best pie you have ever tasted, my lords. Wash it down with Arbor gold and savor every bite. I know I shall.</em></p>
  
  <p>-- Wyman Manderly during the wedding of fake ""Arya Stark""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Frey Pies Theory is that Wyman Manderly killed the three Freys (Rhaegar, Symond, and Jared) who disappeared on the way from White Harbor to Winterfell and baked them into the three huge meat pies he brought for Ramsay Bolton's wedding at Winterfell.
Supporting Evidence</p>

<ul>
<li>Lord Wyman suggests to Davos Seaworth he means to have all three Freys murdered and intimates about giving a guest gift to the Freys in line with their house's breach of guest right at the Red Wedding.</li>
<li>Roose Bolton suspects Lord Wyman had the Freys killed while on the road from White Harbor to Winterfell. Lord Wyman insists the Freys travelled ahead of his column out of impatience over Wyman's slow pace. While not implausible, this is a very flimsy story.</li>
<li>Lord Wyman presents 3 huge pies at the wedding, one for each of the missing Freys.</li>
<li>When the pies are served at the wedding, Lord Wyman cuts portions personally for the Boltons and Freys, to ensure they would eat it. He serves them with great (drunken) exuberance.</li>
<li>At the wedding, Lord Wyman has Abel the Bard sing the Rat Cook for them, a song about an evil cook who kills a prince and bakes him into a pie he then serves to the king. Shortly after Bran dreamed Robb's death, he reflected on the legend of the Rat Cook: he was transformed into a giant white rat by the gods, not because of his deeds, but specifically because he dishonoured guest right. </li>
</ul>

<p>-- end copy --</p>

<p>I have also heard it mentioned that during this feast and the questioning about the missing Freys, Lord Wyman said ""mayhaps"" several times. The use of the word ""mayhaps"" is a part of a children's game the Freys play (the lord of the crossing) where you are allowed to lie, as long as you include the word ""mayhaps"" in what you say.</p>

<p>The evidence is not overwhelming, but when you read the book with this in mind, it becomes rather more apparent that this is what happened, in my opinion. Especially considering the anger Lord Wyman shows when talking to Davos.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ""They watch me, ser. Day and night their eyes are on me, noses sniffing for some whiff of treachery. You saw them, the arrogant Ser Jared and his nephew Rhaegar, that smirking worm who wears a dragon's name. Behind them both stands Symond, clinking coins. That one has bought and paid for several of my servants and two of my knights. One of his wife's handmaids has found her way into the bed of my own fool. If Stannis wonders that my letters say so little, it is because I dare not even trust my maester. Theomore is all head and no heart. You heard him in my hall. Maesters are supposed to put aside old loyalties when they don their chains, but I cannot forget that Theomore was born a Lannister of Lannisport and claims some distant kinship to the Lannisters of Castlerly Rock. Foes and false friends are all around me, Lord Davos. They infest my city like roaches, and at night I feel them crawling over me."" The fat man's fingers coiled into a fist, and all his chins trembled. ""My son Wendel came to the Twins a guest. He ate Lord Walder's bread and salt, and hung his sword upon the wall to feast with friends. And they murdered him. <em>Murdered</em>, I say, and may the Freys choke upon their fables. I drink with Jared, jape with Symond, promise Rhaegar the hand of my own beloved granddaughter... but never think that means I have forgotten. <strong>The north remembers, Lord Davos. The north remembers, and the mummer's farce is almost done.</strong> My son is home.""<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; Something about the way Lord Wyman said that chilled Davos to the bone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And later:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; My body has become a prison more dire than the Wolf's Den. Even so, I must go to Winterfell. Roose Bolton wants me on my knees, and beneath the velvet courtesy he shows the iron mail. I shall go by barge and litter, attended by a hundred knights and my good friends from the Twins. The Freys came here by sea. They have no horses with them, so I shall present each of them with a palfrey as a guest gift. Do hosts still give guest gifts in the south?""<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; ""Some do, my lord. On the day their guest departs.""<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; ""Perhaps you understand, then.""</p>

"128476","Where was the kingsguard during the sack of King's Landing?","<p>The seven knights of the Kingsguard were stationed in different locations during the last days of King Aerys II. Gerold Hightower, Oswell Whent, and Arthur Dayne were stationed at the Tower of Joy, and later on killed there. Jaime Lannister was in King's Landing with Aerys. Barristan Selmy was at the battle on the Trident. I believe that Jon Darry was also on the Trident. I assume that Darry was killed during the battle, as I can only remember that Selmy surrendered. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Who was the last member of the Kingsguard, where was he at that time, and what happened to him? Was he with the king's wife on Dragonstone? As far as I know, beside slaying Aerys, Jaime only killed the pyromancer Rossart and not one of his Kingsguard brothers. </p>

"128510","The number of soldiers each house can rally","<p>Now that we might see some Vale action, I really wonder the number of soldiers each house can muster. There is a comprehensive semi-canon source for this question: <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Armies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Armies</a></p>

<p>However, I am seeking a canon answer. By canon, I mean the books (<em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>) first. The series (<em>Game of Thrones</em>) are also welcome if they do not directly contradict with the books. I am seeking information of the following sort:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Northern host was about 20000-25000 when they leave Moat Cailin.</li>
<li>Rodrik Cassel gathered more than 2000 when Winterfell was invaded by Theon.</li>
<li>They were attacked by about 400 soldiers from Dreadfort.</li>
<li>Stannis had about 2500-3000 soldiers from the mountain clans.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, the North must have around 25000-30000 soldiers at the least.</p>

<p>We have some direct information as well: Dorne called her banners and mustered 50000 spears, according to the books. The Twins had 4000 soldiers.</p>

<p>Do we have canon information, similar to what I have provided for the rest of the great houses and the Crownlands? <s>Great or small houses are welcome.</s></p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","138809","<p><strong>About 15-30 thousand troops each.</strong></p>

<p>It depends on the House, the war, number of sell-swords available and the current conditions, but in general, as you noted in your question, most of the Great Houses can field roughly 15 to 30 thousand men.</p>

<p>It's not very important to the story <strong>exactly</strong> how many men were fielded by each army; only that they matched with most differences being minor ones. Some had more horses, some more spearmen, etc.</p>

<p>The point of talking about massive armies was to give a sense of the scale, as well as to highlight the tactics used within the battles.</p>

<p>For examply, Robb Stark's army was outnumbered by Tywin's, yet he used his cunning to overcome them in his battles.</p>

<p>The author, George R. R. Martin, has said on multiple occasions that he likes to keep exact details such as dates, timelines, numbers and distances intentionally vague. It is hard to keep up with, and also doesn't necessarily add a huge amount to the plot.</p>

"64004","Why did Melisandre not die by the poison in ACoK?","<p>In the prologue of A Clash of Kings, Maester Cressen tries to assassinate Melisandre with a cup of wine poisoned with <em>the strangler</em>.
Melisandre seems to be aware of the poison and offers him to spill the wine, but Maester Cressen insists.
She then drinks most of the wine, but leaves some for Maester Cressen, who drinks the rest.
Melisandre is unaffected by the poison.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""He <em>does</em> have power here, my lord,"" the woman said. ""And fire
  cleanses."" At her throat, the ruby shimmered redly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After that, Maester Cressen dies of the poisoned wine.</p>

<p>We have seen Melisandre do some pretty impressive stuff (give birth to the shadow baby), but some of her powers have also been attributed to <em>using the right powders and glamours</em>.</p>

<p>Has it ever been explained how Melisandre survived the poison?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","64012","<p>The exact reason is never mentioned, although we can glean some understanding from Melisandre's thoughts to herself in <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Dance_with_Dragons-Chapter_31"" rel=""nofollow"">ADWD Chapter 31</a>:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">

<p>So she must have seen Cressen's attempt ahead of time and prepared herself accordingly - perhaps with an antidote, or magic related to the ruby at her neck.</p>

<hr />

<p>Finally, there is this thought by Dany in <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Clash_of_Kings-Chapter_40"" rel=""nofollow"">ACOK Chapter 40</a> that mentions an enchanted necklace being able to protect against poisons: </p>

"195028","Why were there so many willing accomplices to the Red Wedding?","<p>My question, which I think is agnostic between the <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> and <em>Game of Thrones</em>, is regarding the &quot;guest right&quot; social rule. A lot of online material on GoT stresses how sacred guest right is in the GoT universe, and that every major religion holds it as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>one of the most sacred and inviolable social rules</p>
<p><sub><a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Guest_right"" rel=""noreferrer"">Game of Thrones wikia, Guest right</a></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Red Wedding (Season 3 Episode 9, &quot;The Rains of Castamere&quot;) had a lot of participants: Walder Frey himself, but also the archers and soldiers who slit throats, Roose Bolton, and others.</p>
<p>I could see Walder Frey himself willing to break a social rule as sacred as guest right: from rage, possibly madness (as suggested here: <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/80276/are-the-red-wedding-motives-ever-explained"">Are the Red Wedding motives ever explained?</a>), and maybe to spite the gods thereby - but would there be so many accomplices willing to break guest right if breakers are considered scorned or due for the gods' wrath?</p>
<p>I'm specifically wondering does guest right apply only to a single host, A &quot;head of household&quot;? Is that how footmen who carried out the killings might have justified that they themselves were not breaking guest right? Or is the GoT world sort of like ours, where some people pay lip service to religion but don't <em>really</em> believe in it, and as such simply wouldn't have been fearful of any divine retribution?</p>
<p>I'm curious if the books say anything on these &quot;accomplices&quot;' perspectives.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","195052","<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> There were some absentees on the Frey side, guest right isn't held to as strongly as it once was and it <em>may</em> only apply to the host anyway. Even so a man of the host will most likely follow his host's orders as he doesn't really have any other choice.</p>
<p>In the <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/195031/58193"">answer by @Servitor</a> we see that a few of the Freys didn't attend The Red Wedding, most likely because they didn't want any part in it when we see the people's reactions to explaining their absence. Especially Ser Ryman's reaction both times i.e. stumbling over his words to Robb and sweating and being nervous when talking to Catelyn.</p>
<p>However, it is worth noting that guest right is held to less the further south you go and many people take it less seriously in modern times.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One notable custom that the Northmen hold dearer than any other is guest right, the tradition of hospitality by <strong>which a man may offer no harm to a guest beneath his roof, nor a guest to his host.</strong> The Andals held to something like it as well, but it looms less large in southron minds. In his text Justice and Injustice in the North: Judgments of Three Stark Lords, Maester Egbert notes that crimes in the North in which guest right was violated were rare but were invariably treated as harshly as the direst of treasons. Only kinslaying is deemed as sinful as the violations of these laws of hospitality.</p>
<p><sub><em>The World of Ice and Fire</em>, The North</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also when looking at those in the North where they do hold to it more closely even then there is mistrust to how much the hold to it and it is implied it is more of a tradition than an actual right nowadays.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Your father would have had my head off.&quot; The king [Mance Rayder] gave a shrug. &quot;<strong>Though once I had eaten at his board I was protected by guest right.</strong> The laws of hospitality are as old as the First Men, and sacred as a heart tree.&quot; He gestured at the board between them, the broken bread and chicken bones. &quot;Here you are the guest, and <strong>safe from harm at my hands</strong>... this night, at least. So tell me truly, Jon Snow. Are you a craven who turned your cloak from fear, or is there another reason that brings you to my tent?&quot;</p>
<p>Guest right or no, Jon Snow knew he walked on rotten ice here. One false step and he might plunge through, into water cold enough to stop his heart. Weigh every word before you speak it, he told himself. He took a long draught of mead to buy time for his answer. When he set the horn aside he said, &quot;Tell me why you turned your cloak, and I'll tell you why I turned mine.&quot;</p>
<p><sub><em>A Storm of Swords</em>, Jon I</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I do not know how you observe guest right on your mountain, ser. In the north we hold it sacred. Wun Wun is a guest here.&quot;</p>
<p><sub><em>A Dance with Dragons</em>, Jon IX</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking into the emphasised parts of the quotes above it also seems to imply that guest right is only from the host to the guests who have eaten. Everything refers to the host and the host's roof and &quot;safe from <em>my</em> hands&quot;.</p>
<p>However, it is worth noting that if guest right extends to everyone on the Lord's side it simply comes down to what the Lord says you do... he is your Lord after all. And if you don't go with it then what? You've disobeyed your Lord who is willing to break a sacred tradition by murdering a whole room full of nobles and their men, would you expect to live past that event?</p>
<hr />
<p>On a side note it is worth noting that what respect some people still held for guest right was almost completely gone in areas of the Riverlands following the events of The Red Wedding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hanged. The word sent a jolt of fear through her. She looked at the girl, Jeyne. She is too young to be so hard. &quot;Bread and salt,&quot; Brienne gasped. &quot;The inn... Septon Meribald fed the children... we broke bread with your sister...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Guest right don't mean so much as it used to,&quot; said the girl. &quot;Not since m'lady come back from the wedding. Some o' them swinging down by the river figured they was guests too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We figured different,&quot; said the Hound. &quot;They wanted beds. We gave 'em trees.&quot;</p>
<p><sub><em>A Feast for Crows</em>, Brienne VIII</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just to address Roose Bolton for a moment, he was more than just another Lord caught up in the fray of the event, he actually had a large part in organising it. The quote below alludes to this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Lord of White Harbor leaned forward. &quot;The Freys are no better. They speak of wargs and skinchangers and assert that it was Robb Stark who slew my Wendel. The arrogance of it! They do not expect the north to believe their lies, not truly, but they think we must pretend to believe or die. <strong>Roose Bolton lies about his part in the Red Wedding</strong>, and his bastard lies about the fall of Winterfell. And yet so long as they held Wylis I had no choice but to eat all this excrement and praise the taste.&quot;</p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","128589","<p>GRRM did say that it was a one time event however it does not seem to have held up.

<hr>

<p>This shows that Daenerys did continue to display her resilience against fire in future events of books as well. As you have noted as well, Show is heading into a completely different direction. How did Daenerys manage to appear unburnt out of the cottage? I fear the only speculation we can make is that Show runners are going to build on her supposed immunity to fire even further. </p>

<p>We can't have solid arguments in this regard because GRRM has never given us any details as to what exactly made Dany fireproof during birth of her dragons so we can't find similar patterns in future events she might show knack for being fireproof.</p>

"128591","Does joining an order that requires celibacy automatically annul your marriage in Westeros?","<p>I am wondering about the marriage laws of Westeros. To keep this question from being too broad, let’s discuss only the case of the prevalent religion of Westeros, the Faith of the Seven.</p>

<p>We do know that a marriage of people adhering to Faith of Seven can only be annulled by the High Septon or a council of faith if it hasn't been consummated.</p>

<p>The following orders require vows of celibacy in Westeros:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Kingsguard"" rel=""noreferrer"">Kingsguards</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Night&#39;s_Watch"" rel=""noreferrer"">Nights Watch</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Maesters#Traditions_and_Culture"" rel=""noreferrer"">Order of Maesters</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Faith_of_the_Seven"" rel=""noreferrer"">Septons and Septas of faith</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Silent_sisters"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Silent Sisters</a></li>
</ol>

<p>We do know <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Quentyn_Ball"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ser Quentyn Ball</a> sent his wife to join the Silent Sisters so that he could be free to take the vows of the Kingsguards, since he couldn't get his marriage annulled as it had been consummated. That implies that simply swearing the Kingsguards vows won't automatically annul his marriage. </p>

<p>So what happens if a married man is made to join the Nights Watch? Does his marriage get annulled automatically or is his wife bound to be alone for the rest of her life? </p>

<p>Also what happens if a married man takes the vows of Citadel to become a Maester or becomes a Septon?</p>

<p>For women adhering to the Faith of the Seven, the situation seems clear that joining the Silent Sisters will annul their marriage. It is not so clear as to what happens when a married woman wishes to be a septa? Virginity might not be required to take a Septa's vow because we know <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lemore"" rel=""noreferrer"">Septa Lemore</a> has childbirth marks. (But that in itself means nothing, she might have gotten pregnant after taking a Septa's vows. That is of course if she is not what <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ashara_Dayne"" rel=""noreferrer"">she is suspected to be</a>).</p>

<p>I have also created a Reddit thread for it <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/4uopcf/spoilers_everything_is_marriage_of_someone/"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>, but there are not really many insights there. But do check it in case there might be some comment which might help you form your answer. </p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","181002","<p>I will try to answer the question in general but just note that different orders probably have different rules on marriages. Also it likely depends on who you are: high-born/low-born, male/female, noble/peasant etc.</p>

<hr>

<p>We do not know and there appears to be people on three sides of the argument with:</p>

<ol>
<li>No you're both still married</li>
<li>No but it does mean that an annulment is possible</li>
<li>Yes you are annulled</li>
</ol>

<p>The biggest group of people seem to believe that option 3 is the most likely; especially when considering the Night's Watch. This is because joining the Watch essentially means that you are dead to the world. You give up any titles or lands and leave your place in the world, it would make sense that you also give up your wife. However, as others have pointed out before, the oath is expressed in terms of not doing anything in the future so it does leave way for the Watchmen to still have a wife.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. <strong>I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children.</strong> I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've had a brief conversation with Elio, one of the co-author's of The World of Ice and Fire, on twitter and he seems to be in camp 2 for someone joining the Night's Watch.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think someone could take the black without necessarily annulling the marriage, but their having taken the vows would give grounds for the wife to get an annulment. Just my guess.<br>
  <sub><a href=""https://twitter.com/westerosorg/status/961299784903610368"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Twitter, @westerosorg</a></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this conversation he's also stated that Fireball sent his wife to the Silent Sisters to annul their marriage so he could become eligible to be a member of the Kingsguard. This theory means a man must not be married before joining the order but the implication is the same as you state in that joining the Kingsguard likely doesn't annul a marriage. It would even seem, from Elio's answer, that it is impossible to join if you are married.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Marriages must be annulled before one can become a member. Fireball forced his wife to become a silent sister, apparently, which allowed him to get the annulment that would make him able to take the vows of the Kingsguard.<br>

<p>From Elio's above tweet it would also seem that a wife joining the Silent Sisters means their marriage became eligible for an annulment not that it was an automatic process.</p>

"64147","Could Khal Drogo's Khalasar really have defeated the Iron Throne?","<p>I always found it surprising how scared everyone was about Daenerys' marriage to Khal Drogo and the possibility of the Dothraki horde crossing the Narrow Sea. In Season 1 Episode 5, Robert Baratheon specifically states that if they did cross the sea, they wouldn't be able to stop them. I don't understand this.</p>

<p>He would have all of Westeros behind him. The Knights of Westeros are extremely skilled, trained from an early age in swordsmanship. Their weapons are almost certainly of a higher quality, and they use tactics and strategy (I don't think it's ever stated what kind of battle formations the Dohtraki use). Furthermore, they wear armor, and it has been stated that the Dothrarki's Arakhs wouldn't be able to pierce Westerosi armor (although I don't know if they were talking about plate or mail).</p>

<p>Could the Seven Kingdoms really have lost against Khal Drogo's 40,000 men?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","64164","<p>I think there's two separate questions here: First, could Khal Drogo's khalasar have swept the Seven Kingdoms by themselves?</p>

<p>When Dany poses this very question to Ser Jorah, he seems convinced that they would win in open battle. (I'll be relying on the books for most of my analysis, but it should apply equally to the show).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They are better riders than any knight, utterly fearless, and their bows outrange ours. In the Seven Kingdoms, most archers fight on foot, from behind a shieldwall or a barricade of sharpened stakes. The Dothraki fire from horseback, charging or retreating, it makes no matter, they are full as deadly... and there are so many of them, my lady. Your lord husband alone counts forty thousand mounted warriors in his khalasar... Your brother Rhaegar brought as many men to the Trident, but of that number, no more than a tenth were knights. The rest were archers, freeriders, and foot soldiers armed with spears and pikes. When Rhaegar fell, many threw down their weapons and fled the field. How long do you imagine such a rabble would stand against the charge of forty thousand screamers howling for blood? How well would boiled leather jerkins and mailed shirts protect them when the arrows fall like rain?” (GoT, Daenerys IV)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem is, as Ser Jorah notes, that the Dothraki have no experience or skill with siegecraft. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mind you, Princess, if the lords of the Seven Kingdoms have the wit the gods gave a goose, it will never come to that. The riders have no taste for siegecraft. I doubt they could take even the weakest castle in the Seven Kingdoms, but if Robert Baratheon were fool enough to give them battle...” (GoT, Daenerys IV)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And as for that question, he thinks its likely that while Robert was fool enough to meet them in open battle, his advisors were not.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He is a strong man, brave... and rash enough to meet a Dothraki horde in the open field. But the men around him, well, their pipers play a different tune. His brother Stannis, Lord Tywin Lannister, Eddard Stark... (GoT, Daenerys IV)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So as to whether or not the Dothraki could have taken the Seven Kingdoms <em>by themselves</em>, I think it's debatable, but I'm leaning towards no. So long as someone with any sense in them is behind the Iron Throne, it would be child's play to starve out 40,000 men with no knowledge of the surroundings and therefore limited foraging abilities. At the very least, the Dothraki would have been unable to create a naval blockade, meaning key locations like Dragonstone, Storm's End. and King's Landings would have been well-provisioned throughout the war.</p>

<p>But it's worth noting that in addition to the khalasar, Khal Drogo would likely have had significant allies that would have added to his chances of victory. (I leave the dragons out of this on the fair assumption that they would have never hatched without Drogo's death.)</p>

<p>Viserys seems convinced that some in the realm would rise for him, so much so that he didn't even think he needed the entire khalasar.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We won’t need his whole khalasar, “ Viserys said. His fingers toyed with the hilt of his borrowed blade, though Dany knew he had never used a sword in earnest. “Ten thousand, that would be enough, I could sweep the Seven Kingdoms with ten thousand Dothraki screamers. The realm will rise for its rightful king. Tyrell, Redwyne, Darry, Greyjoy, they have no more love for the Usurper than I do. The Dornishmen burn to avenge Elia and her children. And the smallfolk will be with us. They cry out for their king.” He looked at Illyrio anxiously. “They do, don’t they?” (GoT, Daenerys I)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now obviously, Viserys is pretty delusional about how anxious the realm is for his return. But Robert also tells Eddard that if Viserys returned, Targeryen loyalists would join him:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. Do you forget how many houses fought for Targaryen in the war? They bide their time for now, but give them half a chance, they will murder me in my bed, and my sons with me. If the beggar king crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the traitors will join him.” (GoT, Eddard II)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, this might just be King Robert being paranoid and his legendary hatred of the Targs. But we see some indications in later books that both men are right. To begin with, three of the houses that Viserys names rise against Robert's ""son"" Joffrey-- the Tyrells with Renly, the Darrys with Robb Stark, and the Greyjoys in their own rebellion-- and the fourth, the Redwynes, would have if the Lannisters weren't keeping their twin sons hostage.</p>

<p>I think Viserys was counting on Tyrell support because they were the last major house to turn against Aerys, but it's possible they would have joined out of pure ambition. The Tyrells are shown to basically switch sides to whoever looks like they have the greatest chance of victory, switching from Aerys to Robert to Renly to Joffrey. If the Tyrells ever decided that Drogo and the Targaryens had a better chance, they'd probably turn their cloaks and bring the most populous of the Seven Kingdoms with them.</p>

<p><em>A Feast of Crows</em> reveals that Viserys was right on the nose on two counts. First, Jaime reveals in a flashback that he and Tyrion found hidden dragon banners while staying at Castle Darry, indicating that they are still Targeryen loyalists. But more importantly, it's revealed that:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>Dorne has signed a secret pact to support Viserys and Daenerys when they invade Westeros, and Prince Doran has been plotting the overthrow of the Baratheons and Lannisters for over a decade.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And finally, it's worth noting a notable source of support that even Viserys didn't know he had: the Golden Company.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Which plan?” said Tristan Rivers. “The fat man’s plan? The one that changes every time the moon turns? First, Viserys Targaryen was to join us with fifty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back..."" (DwD, The Lost Lord)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For those who haven't read the books, the Golden Company is an elite mercenary group operating in Essos. It's primarily composed of exiled Westerosi, has 10,000 men in the company, many of them knights, and even have war elephants. They are very skilled at siegecraft, taking several castles with ease in the later chapters of <em>A Dance with Dragons</em>. One of the <em>Winds of Winter</em> sample chapters reveal:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> They have taken over the famously impregnable Storm's End.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I guess if your question is could Khal Drogo have taken the Iron Throne <em>at all</em>, rather than whether or not he could have done it alone, I think the answer is clearly yes. With the combination of his thousands of Dothraki screamers, the Golden Company, a few ragtag Targeryen loyalists, possibly the Tyrells...</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> ...and definitely the Dornish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like all what if? scenarios, nothing is 100% certain. Robb Stark and Renly Baratheron were both major players who were burned because of major unforeseen circumstances. In particular, Khal Drogo and Viserys are both wild cards. I can see either one of them acting in a way that would alienate their possible Westerosi allies. But I think they had a real shot at victory.</p>

"64353","Why do people pray to the Stranger?","<p>When characters discuss the seven gods of the Faith, if the Stranger is mentioned at all, it is usually seemingly to emphasise that nobody prays to him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A thousand [candles] twinkled for the Mother... but you could count the Stranger's candles on two hands</p>
<p>Cersei, AFFC</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So why do people pray to him at all? It's not like Satan, where worship and communion with him is unanimously abhorred by the religion it belongs to; there doesn't seem to be a stigma attached to Stranger-worship, it's just not the done thing. From Sam's description of The Stranger in AFFC he seems to be like Death, or is at least strongly linked to death. Do people pray to him for death?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","64357","<p>The Stranger is indeed the death god of the Faith of the Seven as well as the god of the unknown. I imagine the main reason very few people pray to him is the taboo surrounding death that exists in most human cultures. Most people just don't like thinking about death, let alone praying to its personification. For similar reasons, the Stranger is the only god without hymns.</p>

<p>In addition to his unpleasant domain, the Stranger, in his name and his popular depictions, is seen as inhuman, distant, and unknowable. The statue of the Stranger that Stannis burns was ""carved to look more animal than human"" (CoK, Davos I). The Stranger's likeness in the Red Keep also has a ""halfhuman face"" (CoK, Sansa IV) Catelyn Stark's description of a sept's statue of the Stranger is particularly unappealing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...the Stranger was neither male nor female, yet both, ever the outcast, the wanderer from far places, less and more than human, unknown and unknowable. Here the face was a black oval, a shadow with stars for eyes. It made Catelyn uneasy. She would get scant comfort there. (CoK, Catelyn III)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, the Stranger is creepy. But there are actually a few instances of people praying to the Stranger in the books, for a series of reasons:</p>

<p><b>KINSHIP</b></p>

<p>Tyrion lights a candle to the Stranger in a sept:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tyrion lingered after his cousin had slipped away. At the Warrior’s altar, he used one candle to light another. Watch over my brother, you bloody bastard, he’s one of yours. He lit a second candle to the Stranger, for himself. (CoK, Tyrion III)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tyrion's prayer ""for himself"" is a bit ambiguous. If he was lighting a candle to prevent his death, it seems odd that he wouldn't light one for Jaime at that altar as well. My guess is that because the Stranger is the ""outcast"" according to Catelyn, Tyrion thinks he is also ""one of"" the Stranger's the way Jaime is ""one of"" the Warrior's.</p>

<p>Likewise, the Silent Sisters who prepare bodies for burial are considered servants of the Stranger, and presumably pray to him fairly often.</p>

<p><strong>IN THANKS</strong></p>

<p>Cersei gives another example of why someone might light a candle to the Stranger: to thank him for someone else's death.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One day she must light a candle to the Stranger for carrying Renly off and leaving Stannis. If it had been the other way around, her life would have been harder. (FfC, Cersei II)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>FOR DEATH</strong></p>

<p>Cersei implies in the same chapter that those who want death also pray to the Stranger.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""...When we find the Imp, we will find the Lady Sansa too. She is not dead... but before I am done with her, I promise you, she will be singing to the Stranger, begging for his kiss.” (FfC, Cersei II)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is also the purpose of the statue of the Stranger in the House of the Many-Faced God, a place in Braavos fore those seeking death.</p>

<p><strong>SHEER DESPERATION</strong></p>

<p>Cersei prays to the Stranger when she is in great peril.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All the prayers they had taught her as a girl came back to Cersei... and she made up new ones as needed, calling on the Mother and the Maiden, on the Father and the Warrior, on the Crone and the Smith. She had even prayed to the Stranger. <em>Any god in a storm.</em> (DwD, Cersei I)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that Cersei's prayer to the Stranger is remarked upon as unusual <em>even though her life is at stake</em>, indicates that people probably don't pray to the Stranger to prevent death. Indeed, when Stannis attacks King's Landing, Sansa notes that the brightest altars are the Warrior (god of warriors and combat) and the Mother (goddess of mercy).</p>

<p>EDIT: The wiki points out an interesting depiction of the Stranger in the newest Winds of Winter sample chapter I thought I'd add. Minor spoilers:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> A Braavosi play called Bloody Hand depicts a fictionalized account of Tyrion Lannister. In the play, a psuedo-Tyrion meets with the Stranger and is implied to strike a sort of Faustian bargain. Mind you, the Braavosi are not the best source for Westerosi religious beliefs. But that seems to confirm that the Stranger is seen as the patron god for the outcasts of Westeros.</p>

<p>Is there any indication that tells us that Varys approached Ser Barristan (directly or indirectly) about where he should go to?
Or was removing Ser Barristan from the Lannister side enough of a goal for him and was his appearance next to Daenerys not his doing?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","64439","<p>I think Varys makes it perfectly clear that the claimant to the Iron Throne he supports is Aegon. So right off the bat, I have trouble seeing why Varys would have wanted Ser Barristan to go to Dany instead of him. Ilyrio and Varys only support Dany to the extent that she can aid Aegon's claim.</p>

<p>Ser Barristan himself gives Daenerys an account of what happened after he left Joffrey's service. He stayed in King's Landing for a month disguised as a peasant, until he witnessed the execution of Eddard Stark. At that moment, he began questioning his years of service to the Usurper, and realizes the only way to make penitence is to find Aerys' daughter and pledge his service. He never says how he ended up with Ilyrio, but he would have known from the Small Council meetings that Ilyrio and the Targeryen siblings were close.</p>

<p>All indications from Ser Barristan are that he genuinely had a desire to seek Dany out and protect her. He could be lying I suppose, but we get no sense of that from his POV chapters and it'd run contrary to his character. So if Varys DID intend for Ser Barristan to go to her, it was a pretty lucky guess on his part.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I can see many reasons why Varys wouldn't want Barristan with Dany. Ser Barristan has a very negative view of Varys, and outs Ser Jorah as one of the Spider's spies. He can also confirm that Varys was the one who sent Robert's order to have her killed, and even voted for her death.</p>

<p>I think it's much more likely that Varys just wanted to weaken Joffrey by sending away a major asset. The fact that Ser. Barristan ended up with Daenerys instead of Renly or Stannis was likely just a happy coincidence.</p>

<p>Melisandre said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Necromancy animates these wights, yet they are still only dead flesh.
  Steel and fire will serve for them. The ones you call the Others are
  something more.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This implies that Others can't be killed by normal fire and steel. </p>

<p>Also in <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Fight_at_the_Fist"" rel=""noreferrer"">Battle of the Fist of First Men</a>, we saw that fire arrows did not stop the onslaught of the others and their thralls.</p>

<p>This proves that others are immune to ordinary fire and thus it makes no sense for Three Eyed Raven to try and warn the mad king to the danger and to use ordinary fire against them. Granted, Wildfire burns hotter than ordinary fire but it is no magical fire. </p>

<p>Some might point out that Pyromancers do mention that appearance of dragons could result in increased production of Wildfire in prelude to battle of Blackwater bay but that does not prove Wildfire is magical. If it were magical, art of producing wildfire should have died when last dragon died in reign of Aegon III. Dragons might act as catalyst to production of Wildfire but the product remains chemical in nature, not magical. </p>

<h2>Three Eyed Raven's preferred means of Communication</h2>

<p>When Three eyed Raven wanted to communicate something, he uses dreams and even messengers as we saw in case of Bran when he used to appear in his dreams and even sent the Reed Siblings to get him to North. He did not ""warg"" into Bran and make him come beyond the wall. </p>

<h2>Skin Changers code of Ethics beyond the wall</h2>

<p>From what we know from Wildlings, Skinchangers have a code of honor according to <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Haggon"" rel=""noreferrer"">which warging into another human is considered horrible and abomination</a> if used to manipulate the other person.  </p>

<h2>Targaryen Inbreeding and madness</h2>

<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Targaryen_madness"" rel=""noreferrer"">Targaryen madness</a> is something which can be attributed to centuries of incest and inbreeding. Aerys's grandfather, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon_V_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Aegon V</a> detested incest and tried to marry his children to other houses. Two of them, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jaehaerys_II_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Jaehaerys</a> and <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Shaera_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Shaera</a> however secretly married each other and Aegon was forced to accept that. Jaehaerys and Shaera later had Aerys (insane) and Rhaella (sane), who were married to each other. Results were Rhaegar (sane), Viserys (Insane), Daenerys (Sane). Aegon V himself had a mad brother, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aerion_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Aerion the Monstrous</a>, who thought drinking wildfire would make him a dragon. </p>

<p>Historical mad Targaryens include:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Maegor_I_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">King Maegor the Cruel</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Baelor_I_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">King Baelor the Blessed</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rhaegel_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Prince Rhaegel</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aerion_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Prince Aerion</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aerys_II_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">King Aerys II the Mad</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Viserys_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Prince Viserys</a></li>
</ol>

<p>No one warged into five of the six even if we assume Aerys went mad because of that, they still were insane.</p>

<h2>Who is Three eyed raven?</h2>

<p>In Books, it is a <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/2hcg3q/spoilers_adwd_who_is_bloodraven/"" rel=""noreferrer"">very popular theory</a> that three eyed raven is a Targaryen himself, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Brynden_Rivers"" rel=""noreferrer"">Brynden Bloodraven</a>, son of King Aegon IV and uncle to Maester Aemon. He killed his <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daemon_I_Blackfyre"" rel=""noreferrer"">half-brother</a> and <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Blackfyre_Rebellion"" rel=""noreferrer"">nephews</a> to protect Targaryen dynasty in Blackfyre rebellions. He was later sent to the wall for another such act done to protect the Targaryen dynasty from Blackfyres. Why would he sow seeds to destroy it by taking the risk of making Aerys mad even if we discard the evidence that Aerys was inbred enough to go mad anyways?</p>

<p>Three eyed raven said about changing course of events:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I have my own ghosts, Bran. A brother that I loved (<a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daemon_I_Blackfyre"" rel=""noreferrer"">Daemon</a> or <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daeron_II_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Daeron</a>), a
  brother that I hated (<a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegor_Rivers"" rel=""noreferrer"">Aegor</a>), a woman that I desired (<a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Shiera_Seastar"" rel=""noreferrer"">Shiera</a>). Through
  the trees, I see them still, but no word of mine has ever reached
  them. The past remains the past. We can learn from it, but we cannot
  change it.""</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Aerys's Obsession with fire and dragons</h2>

<p>Aerys was obsessed with fire <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aerys_II_Targaryen#Year_of_the_False_Spring"" rel=""noreferrer"">long before</a> Others ever reappeared after the long night. According to Jaime, Aerys hoped to rise again as a dragon from ashes, another one of Targaryen madnesses. Aerion too thought that drinking wildfire would make him rise as a dragon. His order to burn the city was simply given to take final revenge from Robert as a Dragon. Jaime made sure that did not happen by cutting his throat.</p>

<p>From ASOS Jaime V, Jaime recalling Aerys's order to burn the city:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aerys meant to have the greatest funeral pyre of them all. Though if
  truth be told, I do not believe he truly expected to die. Like Aerion
  Brightfire before him, Aerys thought the fire would transform him...
  that he would rise again, reborn as a dragon, and turn all his enemies
  to ash.</p>

"64565","Why was Shae in the Tower of the Hand?","<p>I haven't read the books yet, but I have been watching and re-watching and re-watching again, the show. And nowhere since he first appeared on the screen Tywin Lannister seemed like the kind of person who will use the service of a whore. Let alone share one with his son.</p>

<p>But sure enough, from reading about the fourth season finale a little bit, it seems that this part was more or less true to the books. So Shae was with Tywin the night Tyrion was sprung out, and it seems to hint that Shae and Tywin ""did the deed"".</p>

<p>So I wonder if the books reveal a different Tywin than Charles Dance's excellent acting?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","64576","<p>If one pays close attention to what <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tywin_Lannister"">Tywin</a> says to <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tyrion"">Tyrion</a>, one can notice, as Theik says in his answer, that he is not opposed to visiting whores, only in doing so publicly. For example, he says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You will <em>not</em> bring the whore to court.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(I.e. ""keep her out of sight"".) And</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You're done with whores. The next one I find in your bed, I'll hang.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(I.e. ""make sure I don't find her"".) And of course, we are familiar with the story of Tysha, the common girl that Tywin ""made"" into a whore by allowing his soldiers to rape her. </p>

<p>The foreshadowing of Tywin's derogatory view of prostitutes is <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tytos_Lannister"">his father's</a> relationship with a woman who was <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tytos_Lannister%27s_mistress"">""a common born woman, daughter of a candlemaker""</a>. Lord Tytos was not a strong lord, and this woman took liberties that according to Tywin shamed house Lannister. He therefore upon his father's death punished her by stripping her naked and running her out of town. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I was made to suffer my father's follies. I will not suffer yours."" <br>
  -- Tywin to Tyrion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If one pays close attention to an earlier Tyrion chapter, where Tyrion and <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Varys"">Varys</a> discuss a hidden entrance to the brothel that Tyrion uses as cover:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Tyrion:] ""How is it a brothel happens to have a secret entrance?""<br></p>
  
  <p>[Varys:] ""The tunnel was dug for another King's Hand, whose honor would not allow him to enter such a house openly. Chataya has closely guarded the knowledge of its existence."" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We do not know for sure, of course, but Tywin was Hand of the King for a good long time, during Aerys' reign.</p>

<p>With all this in mind, it does look as though Tywin has a rather warped relationship to prostitutes. He takes every chance to humiliate and punish them in public -- like he whipped <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Alayaya"">Alayaya</a> because he thought Tyrion had slept with her -- while in private, they are his guilty pleasure. </p>

<p>But of course, the only real evidence is that we know he slept with Shae.</p>

"64585","Why did Petyr Baelish want Ned to send Loras instead of Lord Beric?","<p>In <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Game_of_Thrones-Chapter_43"" rel=""noreferrer"">Chapter 43 of AGOT</a>, Ned Stark sends Lord Beric Dondarrion to bring Ser Gregor Clegane to justice in the name of the King. In the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Game_of_Thrones-Chapter_44"" rel=""noreferrer"">next chapter</a>, Petyr Baelish overhears Sansa say that Ned should have sent Ser Loras instead. This catches his attention:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The young lady is as wise as she is lovely</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then he asks her why, and Sansa reluctantly explains her ""heroes and monsters"" reasoning. Petyr responds:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, those are not the reasons I'd have given, but...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why would Petyr have charged Ser Loras with this task?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","64614","<p>At that point of time Petyr was still banking on Ned coming out triumphant with him riding on his coat tails. The Lannisters were a major House, and had immense amounts of power not only financially, but militarily and politically as well. </p>

<p>If Ned had sent Loras Tyrell instead of Beric Dondarrion, that would've meant that the Tyrells were (at least nominally) on the Stark side. The Mountain attacking a force lead by a beloved Tyrell son, would've been a grave insult to another major House that rivals the Lannisters in power. If something would've happened to Loras (as it did to Beric) the Tyrells would've become completely antagonistic to the Lannisters with very little chance of peace between them, let alone alliance.</p>

<p>Instead, Ned (who is incredibly naive when it comes to politics) sends a minor lord of small House, a smattering of knights of little influence, and most of the Stark household guards. Petyr knew this was a huge mistake, and tells Sansa as much.</p>

"129414","What are the advantages that come with knighthood in Westeros?","<p>Often in the story we see characters be promised knighthood. This usually seems to be a big deal to those that receive it. For example after the battle of the Blackwater, Bronn clearly reminds people of his new status. Surely there must be more to knighthood than simple social status or else people wouldn't make such a big deal of knighthood.</p>

<p>What are the advantages a man gains when knighted? Does he gain lands? Or simply prestige?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><laws>","129570","<p>Being a Knight puts you above the smallfolk and opens up prospects but you are still beneath the landed nobility. You can say they are sort of a Quasi-Nobility (If they are not descended from nobility itself). Following are some benefits a Knight enjoys:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Knights can <strong>marry younger daughters of landed houses</strong> and thus climb up a step on social ladder like <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bronn"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ser Bronn of Blackwater</a> did by marrying <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lollys_Stokeworth"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lolys Stokeworth</a>. A commoner can never hope to marry an aristocrat girl but Knights are considered a valid match for at least younger daughters of impoverished or minor houses. <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Duncan_the_Tall"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ser Eustace Osgrey</a>, head of a minor and diminished house from the Reach said he would have married his daughter Alysanne to Ser Duncan the tall if she were alive. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, Commonborn Knights are no fit consort for Ladies of major houses   as <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rohanne_Webber"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lady Rohanne Webber</a> decided not to marry Duncan despite having feelings for him. She later went on to be grandmother of Lord Tywin Lannister. Quoting Rohanne Webber from <em>The Sworn Sword</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You are quite mad,"" The smoke had filled her eyes with tears. ""If you
  were better born, I would have married you""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later she said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I had to marry you know... my father's will. Oh don't be such a fool.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bonifer_Hasty"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ser Bonifer Hasty</a> and Princess (Later Queen) <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rhaella_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Rhaella Targaryen</a> loved each other but Bonifer could never hope to marry the princess because  of his low birth. According to Barristan Selmy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Their love was ultimately a brief thing and could never have been
  otherwise, as Bonifer was of far too low birth to be considered as a
  suitor for a princess of the royal line</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In more recent events, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Amerei_Frey"" rel=""noreferrer"">Amerei ""Gatehouse"" Frey</a> married a hedge knight named <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Pate_of_the_Blue_Fork"" rel=""noreferrer"">Pate of the Blue Fork</a>. The unseemly match was made because Amerei was daughter of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Merrett_Frey"" rel=""noreferrer"">9th son</a> of Lord Walder Frey and was notorious for her promiscuity. </p></li>
<li><p>Knights can escape judgement of a lord for any crime by demanding <strong>a trial by combat</strong>. It might not save you but at least you don't get to be sentenced by some posh aristocrat. <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Duncan_the_Tall"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ser Duncan the Tall</a> used this right to escape judgment of lordlings for hitting Prince Aerion Targaryen. As <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Baelor_Targaryen_(son_of_Daeron_II)"" rel=""noreferrer"">Prince Baelor Breakspear</a> told Ser Duncan in <em>The Hedge Knight</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You have another choice though"", Prince Baelor said quietly. ""Whether it
  is a better choice or worse, I can not say, But I remind you that any
  Knight accused of a crime has a right to demand trial by combat.""</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Knights can <strong>win renown and money by jousting</strong> (And winning) against rich nobles. Non-Knights can some times be allowed to joust as well like in Tourney of KL but there are events in which it is only reserved for Knights such as Tourney at Ashford. Quoting Plummer the Steward from <em>The Hedge Knight</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Plummer pursed his lips. ""My Lord's tourney is a contest for Knights.
  Are you a Knight?""</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Knights can officially and legally <strong>lay foundation of a new house</strong> by taking a name and forming their coat of Arms. For example, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Artys_I_Arryn"" rel=""noreferrer"">Artys Arryn</a> who founded House Arryn was originally a knight. Their coat of Arms can only be inherited by their true-born sons. Bastards can not inherit or display the arms. A true-born daughter or son can display the arms but he can not call himself a Knight unless he is anointed and Knighted by some Knight. Quoting Prince Baelor from <em>The Hedge Knight</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""By law, only a true born son is entitled to inherit a Knight's arms.
  You must needs find a new device Ser, A sigil of your own.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also Jon said in <em>AGOT</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Girls get the arms but not the swords. Bastards get the swords but
  not the   arms. I did not make the rules, little sister.""</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Knights can legally <strong>create new Knights &amp; take squires</strong>. e.g. Ser Lyonel Baratheon knighted squire Raymun Fossoway. Ser Arthur Dayne knighted the squire Jaime Lannister. Ser Arlan of Pennytree apparently knighted his squire Duncan the Tall. Quoting Ser <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lyonel_Baratheon"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lyonel Baratheon</a> from <em>The Hedge Knight</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The lad has the truth of it,"" said Ser Lyonel Baratheon. ""Do it, Ser
  Duncan. Any knight can make a knight"".</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Knights are usually <strong>held in high esteem by common people and orders</strong> such as the Nights Watch. Knights are usually preferred to command at Night's Watch for different tasks for example <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Wynton_Stout"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ser Wynton Stout</a> was chosen as Castellan of Castle Black when Bowen Marsh went West to fight at bridge of Skulls. Sole reason for this appointment was that Stout was a knight. From <em>ASOS, Jon's POV</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If Marsh is gone, who did he name as castellan?”</p>
  
  <p>The armorer laughed. “Ser Wynton, gods preserve him. Last knight in
  the castle and all. The thing is, Stout seems to have forgotten and no
  one’s been rushing to remind him. I suppose I’m as much a commander as
  we have now. The meanest of the cripples.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly Jaime recalls that on his return from Harrenhal after being   officiated as a Knight of Kingsguard, the bar keep refused to take money from him and said that this was a story to tell his grandchildren. <em>From ASOS, Jaime's POV</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The innkeep had refused his coin. ""It's an honor to have a knight of
  the Kingsguard under my roof, ser,"" the man had said. ""It's a tale
  I'll tell my grandchildren.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it can be said that this sort of special treatment comes with being a Knight of the Kingsguard or a Knight of massive fame. </p></li>
<li><p>Knights can hope to <strong>ransom themselves if they are bested</strong> in battle. Common soldiers are not taken captives and are usually slaughtered. Knights however can yield to their enemies in hopes to be ransomed later. From <em>Tyrion's POV in ACOK</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I yield, ser,” a different knight called out, farther down the river.
  “Yield. Ser knight, I yield to you. My pledge, here, here.” The man
  lay in a puddle of black water, offering up a lobstered gauntlet in
  token of submission.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also from <em>Arya's POV in ACOK</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gendry frowned. “Knights and lordlings, they take each other captive
  and pay ransoms, but they don’t care if the likes of you yield or
  not.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Knights have <strong>better prospects at finding service</strong> than a common man at arms because Knights are thought to be valuable fighters due to their rigorous training which usually starts at childhood. Service with landed nobles can give them a chance to perform tasks which can in turn reward them with landed titles of their own from their liege. They can even rise to companionship of Kings as Knights of Kingsguard.</p></li>
<li><p>Knights are usually <strong>held in high esteem by the faith of seven</strong> because of their vows to defend the faith and because of knighthood being rooted in Andal religion. With reformation of faith militant, Knights can seek service there as well. Quoting <em>from a Feast For Crows, Brienne's POV</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When they saw the hedge knights, the begging brothers halted, and the
  chanting died away. “Good knights,” one said, “the Mother loves you.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Being a Knight has an <strong>impact on your love life</strong> as well. Westerosi Ladies seem to love the valiant Knights. Example would be the innkeep's daughter whose mother (The innkeep) complained about that to Ser Duncan the Tall:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The girl turn to sighs and giggles everytime a knight rides by. I
  swear I could not tell you why. Knights are built the same as other
  men.""</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Your <strong>word carries more weight</strong> if you swear it by ""your honor as a knight"". Same goes for your testimonies. Ferrymen on trident took Sandor Clegane on board when he swore a false oath on his honor as a knight to pay them when they were across. <em>From ASOS, Arya's POV</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“How do I know you’re good for it?” the bent-backed man asked, after a
  moment. He’s not, she wanted to shout. instead she bit her lip.</p>
  
  <p>“Knight’s honor,” the Hound said, unsmiling. He’s not even a knight.
  She did not say that either.</p>
  
  <p>“That will do.” The ferryman spat.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Knights are thought to be a <strong>boost to prestige of a diplomatic mission</strong> especially if they are descended from some noble house. We saw this when Petyr Baelish demanded Knights should accompany him at his meeting with Tyrells. <em>From AFFC, Tyrion POV</em>, Baelish said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“And forty more-twenty knights with as many squires. If I arrive
  without a knightly tail, the Tyrells will think me of small account.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Knights can <strong>support other Knights in</strong> <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Trial_of_seven"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>trials of seven</strong></a>. e.g. Ser Lyonel Baratheon joined Ser Duncan the Tall in his trial against Prince Aerion. Quoting <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Maekar_I_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Prince Maekar</a> from <em>A Hedge Knight</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Don’t play the fool, it will not serve. It must be seven against
  seven. You must needs find six other knights to fight beside you.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also Quoting Ser Steffon Fossoway from <em>A Hedge Knight</em>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Raymun the Reluctant,” mocked his cousin Ser Steffon. An apple made
  of gold and garnets fastened his cloak of yellow wool. “You need not
  fear, cousin, this is a knightly combat. As you are no knight, your
  skin is not at risk. Ser Duncan, you have one Fossoway at least. The
  ripe one. I saw what Aerion did to those puppeteers. I am for you.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Knights can be offered <strong>a chance to join Night's Watch</strong> as Tywin Lannister offered Ser Alliser Thorne &amp; Ser Jaremy Rykker a chance to Join NW or be beheaded. But this is not exclusive to Knights, commonfolk can also be offered that chance. <em>From AGOT, Tyrion's POV</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ser Jaremy Rykker commented dryly. “I ought to know, I was there on
  the battlements beside him (Thorne). Tywin Lannister gave us a
  splendid choice. Take the black, or see our heads on spikes before
  evenfall. No offense intended, Tyrion.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Knights <strong>can sit in viewing gallery</strong> with nobles in a tourney. Quoting Ser Raymun Fossoway from <em>The Hedge Knight</em>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Well met lad,"" Ser Raymun said easily. ""Ser Duncan, why not watch
  from the viewing gallery? All knights are welcome there.""</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Knights can <strong>demand a Trial of Seven</strong> and accept challenges of their opponents to it if they wish. Ser <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Damon_Morrigen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Damon Morrigen</a> accepted challenge of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Maegor_I_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">King Maegor the Cruel's</a> <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Visenya_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">mother</a> to prove Maegor's unworthiness to throne. A trial of seven took place <s>but it is not clear who asked for it, The crown or the Warrior's sons? It is most likely that Damon Morrigen and fellow Warrior's sons demanded that form, being zealots and everything</s>, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Faith_Militant_uprising"" rel=""noreferrer"">demanded by Ser Damon</a>. However Maegor fought &amp; won, emerging as sole survivor. Similarly Prince Aerion Targaryen demanded a trial of Seven when Ser Duncan the Tall demanded a trial of combat in <em>The Hedge Knight</em>.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""A trial of seven,” said Prince Aerion, smiling. “That is my right, I
  do believe"".</p>
  
  <p>.</p>
  
  <p>.</p>
  
  <p>“Or mayhap they simply had a taste for swordplay,” said Lord Leo
  Tyrell, a cynical smile touching his lips. “Regardless, Ser Aerion is
  within his rights. A trial of seven it must be.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><strong>FREE FOOD AT WEDDINGS!!!!</strong> It is considered bad luck to refuse to host a knight on one's wedding among the nobles. So Knights are always welcome at noble weddings. Ser Duncan the Tall enjoyed this benefit at wedding of Lord Butterwell with daughter of Lord Frey. Quoting from <em>The Mystery Knight</em>, Ser Duncan notices:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Though uninvited, the three of them had been welcomed to the feast
  quick enough; It was ill luck to refuse a knight hospitality on your
  wedding day.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<p>However Knighthood does not guarantee lands. A knight may or may not be landed. </p>

<p>If a Knight is sworn to some landed noble, he is a house-hold knight aka <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Knight#Types_of_knights"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>Sworn sword</strong></a>. If a Knight holds some lands from his liege lord, he becomes a <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Landed_knight"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>Landed knight</strong></a>.

"129553","Is Ser Davos based on any historical figures?","<p>Obviously, George R. Martin draws heavily from medieval history in writing GoT; Lancasters become Lannisters, along with many other elements of pre-Tudor power struggles...but is our lovable onion knight based on any actual historical figures?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","129573","<p>There are a number of historical counterparts which can be associated with Davos. The most prominent comparison is likely that of Thomas Cromwell. </p>

<p>1) Both men were of common birth; with Davos coming from flea bottom, and Cromwell being the son of a blacksmith from Surrey. </p>

<p>2) Both men were largely disliked by the landed gentry </p>

<p>3) Both men acted as advisers to a strong willed king and spoke their views openly regarding issues facing their monarch. </p>

<p><a href=""http://englishhistory.net/tudor/thomas-cromwell/"">Thomas Cromwell</a></p>

<p>Davos's story is that of upward mobility; a quintessential example of the self made man.

<p>Davos's character seems to act more as a literary contrast to Littlefinger and Bronn than fill the role of a historical equivalent. Davos represents morality, Bronn is amoral, and Littlefinger immoral. </p>

<p>Davos doesn't crave growth or glory and only want to do the best for his king and his family, Bronn will take advantage of the opportunities when they arise, and Littlefinger actively craves more power. </p>

"129575","Is wildfire magical or chemical?","<p>I came to think of it from interesting discussion at <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/129313/did-this-game-of-thrones-character-cause-the-previous-king-to-go-mad/129323#129323"">one of my answers regarding wildfire</a>.</p>

<p>My understanding was that Wildfire is not magical because nothing suggests that it was. Granted that Order of Pyromancers keeps calling the manufacturing process a ""spell"" but they call everything a spell and hint at their own magical prowess as noted by Tyrion. The <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Alchemists&#39;_Guild"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">guild of Alchemists</a> is not named so without a reason. If wildfire were magical, then that art should have been lost with death of the last dragon in Aegon III's reign as magic <s>went</s> begun to go out of the world then apparently. Some quotes from ACOK:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The substance was the pyromancers’ own term for wildfire. They called
  each other wisdom as well, which Tyrion found almost as annoying as
  their custom of hinting at the vast secret stores of knowledge that
  they wanted him to think they possessed. Once theirs had been a
  powerful guild, but in recent centuries the maesters of the Citadel
  had supplanted the alchemists almost everywhere. Now only a few of the
  older order remained, and they no longer even pretended to transmute
  metals...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again from ACOK about ""spell"" on apparently fire-sensing ceilings:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By spell Tyrion imagined Hallyne meant clever trick. He thought he
  would like to inspect one of these false-ceilinged cells to see how it
  worked, but this was not the time. Perhaps when the war was won.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But counter argument is strong as well. Reforging Valyrian steel swords was still in practice after death of dragons which is also supposedly carried out with spells. Also existence of dragons seems to have improved quality of all fire-related ""magic"" spells. Admittedly it makes no sense that dragons should act as a catalyst in production of wildfire if it was not magic.</p>

<p>So the question is, Is wildfire really magical? Or the spells are simple chemical manufacturing processes for which dragons might play a role of catalyst? </p>

<p>Or can we say that while the procedure required to manufacture wildfire might involve magic but the end product remains chemical?</p>

<p>It might be opinion-based at this point since we do not know it for a fact right now but I'd like to see arguments based on canon sources which can help in determining the nature of wildfire. </p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","129613","<p><strong>Assumption: If wildfire were magical, then that art should have been lost with death of the last dragon in Aegon III's reign as magic went out of the world then apparently.</strong></p>

<p>I disagree with this assumption. Magic in ASOIAF may have varying forms. White walkers were white walking way before dragons were hatched. Faceless men probably have their own form of magic. Children of the forest had their magic. Three eyed raven was watching over Bran long before the dragons. Warging was common beyond the wall. Albeit weak, warlocks of the Qarth had some magic of theirs as well, or they claim they have some magic.</p>

<p>The magic that disappeared or declined seem to be related to fire. Alchemists guild and Valyrian steel forgers suffered from this decline. Art of dragonglass candle burning was also lost.</p>

<p><strong>So the question is, Is wildfire really magical?</strong></p>

<p>My answer is yes, it is magical. Your only evidence against it is Tyrion's skepticism. Tyrion is a smart man, hence he is always skeptic. He was also skeptic of white walkers and giants, but we already know that his skepticism was pointless.</p>

<p>Hallyne the pyromancer and Tyrion had a talk about this.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Tyrion was growing impatient. Ser Jacelyn Bywater was likely here by now and Ironhand misliked waiting. ""Yes, you have secret spells, how splendid, what of them"" ""They, hmmm, seem to be working better than they were."" Hallyne smiled weakly. ""You don't suppose there are any dragons about, do you?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, producing wildfire requires spells and art of wildfire did not die away with the dragons. Wildfire was, in fact the true power of Targaryens.</p>

<p><strong>Or can we say that while the procedure required to manufacture wildfire might involve magic but the end product remains chemical?</strong></p>

<p>I think this part of your question is impossible to answer. We know magic is involved. Is it possible to produce wildfire without magic? The word ""spell"" points to it. I claim a substance is magical if magic is involved in the production. However, in order to fully answer this question, we need to define chemistry, alchemy and magic in ASOIAF world. I hardly think we can precisely define them, so this part of question is more opinion-based.</p>

"269103","Who was Prince Viserys Targaryen (brother of Daenerys) named after?","<p>Viewers of <em>Game of Thrones</em> (2011) were introduced to Prince Viserys Targaryen, the brother of Daenerys Targaryen, and Rhaegar Targaryen. In the <em>Game of Thrones</em> prequel, <em>House of the Dragon</em> (2022), two Viseryses were also introduced: Viserys I Targaryen (father of Rhaenyra Targaryen), and Viserys II Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra Targaryen). Both Viseryses were kings that sat on the Iron Throne. Viserys II was Hand of the King to three kings before sitting on the Iron Throne. Prince Viserys styles himself as &quot;the Third of his Name&quot;,  acknowledging his two identically-named ancestors, one of which, he might be named after.</p>
<p>@TheLethalCarrot raises an interesting point in the comments about Daenerys:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We do, however, know that Dany was named after Daenerys Targaryen (daughter of Aegon IV) [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was wondering, was Prince Viserys, like Daenerys, named after one of their Targaryen ancestors? Which King Viserys did Prince Viserys Targaryen's parents, King Aerys II Targaryen and Queen Rhaella Targaryen, name him after — Viserys I, or Viserys II? Or, did they just like that name, and did not intend to name him after a prior Viserys?</p>
<p>I would like to know which Viserys (if any) was respected and deemed worthy by Prince Viserys' parents of being their son's namesake. This might also give us a hint of how the Westerosi viewed the two prior historical figures in comparison to each other.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><house-of-the-dragon>","269688","<h3>Canon Answer</h3>
<p>We do not know. There is no mention of who was Viserys III's namesake in the books. The main series makes no mention of it or Viserys' birth at all. Only account of his birth we see is in The World of Ice and Fire. And that itself makes no mention of who his namesake was.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His Grace’s new fidelity was apparently pleasing to the Mother Above, it must be said, for the following year, Queen Rhaella gave the king the second son that he had prayed for. Prince Viserys, born in 276 AC, was small but robust, and as beautiful a child as King’s Landing had ever seen.</p>
<p>Though Prince Rhaegar at seventeen was everything that could be wanted in an heir apparent, all Westeros rejoiced to know that at last he had a brother, another Targaryen to secure the succession. The birth of Prince Viserys only seemed to make Aerys II more fearful and obsessive, however. Though the new young princeling seemed healthy enough, the king was terrified lest he suffer the same fate as his brothers</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Speculation based on available information</h3>
<p>As you can see, there is no mention of why he was named as such. But we can use the other information in the chapter to speculate.</p>
<p>Queen Rhaella had two miscarriages and one stillborn before giving birth to Prince Daeron who died in infancy. This was followed by another stillbirth and another miscarriage. Then Prince Aegon was born two months premature and died in infancy. The King disowned all these children after their deaths and claimed they were bastards, struck down by Gods to secure sanctity of the throne by keeping bastards off it, presumably a coping mechanism for his grief. After that, Princess Shaena was also stillborn although Aerys never disowned her to our knowledge. She was followed by Prince Jaehaerys who also died in infancy. Viserys was born after Prince Jaehaerys.</p>
<p>As evident from his sons' names (Daeron, Aegon, Jaehaerys and Viserys), all of them share the names of previous Targaryen monarchs. Only Rhaegar had a unique name. In light of this info, <strong>we can reasonably speculate that Viserys was named after an illustrious ancestor like his dead brothers, not simply because the King liked the name</strong>.</p>
<p>Now that we have somewhat established he was indeed named after a King, we get to your question: Viserys I or Viserys II? We have to go to the main series to find impressions of the learned people of Westeros who are more or less contemporaries of Aerys II. The conversation between Prince Oberyn and Tyrion Lannister (ASOS - Sansa IV) on historical representation of Viserys II provides some insights:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I once had the great good fortune to see the Citadel's copy of Lives
of Four Kings,&quot; Prince Oberyn was telling her lord husband. &quot;The
illuminations were wondrous to behold, but <strong>Kaeth was too kind by half
to King Viserys</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>Tyrion gave him a sharp look. &quot;Too kind? <strong>He scants Viserys shamefully</strong>,
in my view. It should have been Lives of Five Kings.&quot;</p>
<p>The prince laughed. &quot;Viserys hardly reigned a fortnight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He reigned more than a year,&quot; said Tyrion.</p>
<p>Oberyn gave a shrug. &quot;A year or a fortnight, what does it matter? <strong>He
poisoned his own nephew to gain the throne and then did nothing once
he had it</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Baelor starved himself to death, fasting,&quot; said Tyrion. &quot;His uncle
served him loyally as Hand, as he had served the Young Dragon before
him. Viserys might only have reigned a year, but he ruled for fifteen,
while Daeron warred and Baelor prayed.&quot; He made a sour face. &quot;<strong>And if
he did remove his nephew, can you blame him? Someone had to save the
realm from Baelor's follies</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>Sansa was shocked. &quot;But Baelor the Blessed was a great king. He walked
the Boneway barefoot to make peace with Dorne, and rescued the
Dragonknight from a snakepit. The vipers refused to strike him because
he was so pure and holy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My prince is playing with you, Lady Sansa,&quot; said the woman Ellaria
Sand. &quot;The septons and singers like to say that the snakes did not
bite Baelor, but the truth is very different. He was bitten half a
hundred times, and should have died from it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If he had, <strong>Viserys would have reigned a dozen years,&quot; said Tyrion,
&quot;and the Seven Kingdoms might have been better served</strong>. Some believe
Baelor was deranged by all that venom.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So here we can see that even among the learned circles (Both Oberyn and Tyrion are very well versed in History), Viserys II is a polarizing figure. It appears that people suspect him of kinslaying and consider him of little note due to his brief reign. Some like Tyrion however admire him for his long and successful tenure as the hand, prior to becoming the King. There is no similar impressions on Viserys I by the contemporaries of Aerys II so we must rely on the writings before his time. Viserys I is described in TWOIAF and F&amp;B in following words:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Viserys I Targaryen had a <strong>generous amiable nature</strong> and was <strong>well loved by his lords and smallfolk alike</strong>. The reign of the Young King, as the commons called him upon his ascent, was <strong>peaceful and prosperous</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Viserys I Targaryen was not the strongest-willed of kings, it must be said; always amiable and anxious to please, he relied <strong>greatly on the counsel of the men around him</strong> and did as they bid more oft than not.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>He had ruled for six-and-twenty years, reigning over the most prosperous era in the history of the Seven Kingdoms</strong> but seeding within it the disastrous decline of his house and the death of the last dragons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we can see that while Viserys I was not considered particularly strong-willed and decisive and somewhat blamed for the Dance in retrospect, he is still seen as the King who presided over the Golden era of Targaryen dynasty, ushering in a long period of peace, prosperity and justice for all.</p>
<p>In light of this information, <strong>we can reasonably speculate that Viserys III is named after Viserys I</strong>. Kinslaying is a big stigma and while some may argue that Royals may not have cared for public opinion, let us not forget that Prince Maegor (Son of Prince Aerion), lost his chance at the throne for a number of reasons, one of which was being named after Maegor the Cruel. Furthermore, Viserys II's actual reign was inconsequential so it wouldn't make sense for Aerys to name his second son after him.</p>
<p>In any case, it must be noted that it all in the end goes back to Viserys I as Viserys II himself was named by Rhaenyra for her father Viserys I.</p>

"129815","Does Randyll Tarly hate the wildlings in the books?","<p>In Game of Thrones S06 E06 <em>Blood of My Blood</em>, Randyll Tarly is extremely vocal in his hatred of wildlings. Do the books ever show or describe him as having such feelings towards them?</p>

<p>I ask because I was somewhat surprised by the scene. In general the seven kingdoms are disinterested in and have neglected the Night's Watch. Horn Hill is probably close to two thousand miles from The Wall, and a proud lord of the Reach like Randyll Tarly would not be concerned about the skirmishes between poor Northern houses and wildlings, or so I would've thought.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><adaptation-comparison>","129817","<p>In one word, Nope.</p>

<p>But seeing the kind of person Randyll Tarly is, he would be exactly the sort of guy who'd side with people advocating genocide of Wildlings or at least letting them die of their own accord. </p>

<p>Since the Tarlys dwell far in South, it is impossible that the Tarlys ever suffered from Wildling raiders in history so the Tarlys don't have any personal cause for hatred of Wildlings like <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Mors_Umber"">Mors Umber</a> does whose only daughter was abducted by raiders from beyond the wall. Randyll Tarly however strikes me as a man who would be Xenophobic so I suppose the only thing he feels for Wildlings is sheer contempt born out of xenophobia. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, at that time, Tarly was busy <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_at_Duskendale"">expelling Northmen</a> from Riverlands-Crownlands border regions , <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Taking_of_Maidenpool"">sorting out Maidenpool</a> and <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Eleanor_Mooton#A_Feast_for_Crows"">arranging the marriage of his son Dickon</a>. Later he was <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Randyll_Tarly#A_Feast_for_Crows"">moving on Kings Landing</a> in the aftermath of Margaery's arrest by The Faith while all the drama with the Wildling invasion and later resettlement was unfolding. </p>

<p>He never said anything about Wildlings. </p>

<p>Wildlings were a problem of the North and Warden of the North Roose Bolton. Tarly served the Warden of the South, Mace Tyrell. He had more pressing concerns like performing the duty of clearing the Riverlands from Bandits; which the Crown charged him with &amp; later of getting ready to free Queen Margaery, a duty he owed to his liege lord Mace Tyrell. As you correctly state, What happened thousands of leagues away in Northern wilderness was not his concern or in any way threatening for him. </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> However if he gets appointed Hand of the King in light of Kevan's
 murder, I suppose then he would have to form some opinion about
 wildling resettlement and do something about it. Only then would we be able  to learn his thoughts about the Freefolk for sure.</p>

"65059","Do no hedge knights have last names?","<p>All the hedge knights that I can think of introduced in the series so far - Ser Illifer the Penniless, Ser Duncan the Tall, Ser Pate of the Blue Fork, Ser Shadrich of the Shady Glen, etc. - don't have last names, at least that we know of. The one exception I recall is Ser Creighton Longbough, but there is no mention of a House Longbough on AWOIAF, so this may be a name Ser Creighton has invented, not a House name.</p>

<p>I can't find any information that specifically precludes hedge knights from having House names. But (minor spoilers AFFC)</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> ""Knights they are,"" said Petyr. ""Their gallantry has yet to be demonstrated, but we may hope. Allow me to present Ser Byron, Ser Morgarth, and Ser Shadrich.

The three knights bowed and withdrew, though the tall one with the blond hair kissed her hand before taking his leave. ""Hedge knights?"" said Alayne, when the door had closed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which seems to suggest that hedge knights as a rule don't have House names.</p>

<p>So my question is twofold:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is there a reason that none of the hedge knights we've met appear to have House names (Ser Creighton possibly notwithstanding)?</p></li>
<li><p>Could someone from a noble House become a hedge knight and retain their House name?</p></li>
</ul>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","65074","<h2>The only people in Westeros who have last names are the nobles.</h2>

It is only a nobleman, that belongs to a noble house, who can have a <em>proper</em> last name denoting his lineage. So Robb of house Stark is Robb Stark.</p>

<p>Now knights are in an interesting place. They have an honorific placed in front of their names, are a step above the commoners, but that honorific doesn't come with anything else. No lands, thus no noble house, thus no last name. So unless a knight is already of noble birth, he won't get a last name just by being knighted. </p>

<p>Hedge knights, by definition, are poor knights who are not sworn to any single lord on a permanent basis. The vast majority of them are of common stock, since nobly born knights tend to find employment easier with other nobles, which gives us a lot of knights living in the hedges with no last name. To give themselves proper <em>airs</em> most of those titleless knights adopt a qualifier of some sort to distinguish them. A home village (Ser Arlan of Pennytree), or a physical trait (Ser Duncan the Tall), and so on. </p>

"65128","When did Cersei have Robert's illegitimate children dealt with (in the books)?","<p>This is shown fairly explicit in the show: several members of the city guard are shown going about Kings Landing early in Season 2 (if I remember correctly), executing Robert Baratheon's illegitimate children, since they presumably have more right to the throne than Joffrey. Now in ACoK, this is much less obvious, as it is only referred to in a conversation between Tyrion and Janos, right before Tyrion dismisses Janos to the Wall. My question is this: when exactly in the timeline does the massacre of Robert's illegitimate children happen in the books? Apart from this conversation, there isn't much indication that the people of King's Landing have been distressed by this, until much later when we see their anger at Joffrey for being quite a lousy king in general. Was this massacre performed recently after Ned's execution, hence why Yoren brought Gendry with him to the Wall?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","65130","<p><a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Massacre_in_King%27s_Landing"" rel=""noreferrer"">Possibly some help?</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the massacre of Robert
  Baratheon's bastards is ordered by Queen Regent Cersei Lannister (not
  Joffrey) <strong>shortly before the arrival of Tyrion Lannister the capital.</strong>
  This was not the first time Cersei ordered the death of a bastard
  child of her husband; according to Littlefinger, a pair of twins
  Robert fathered on a servant at Casterly Rock had previously been
  murdered (it is unknown if the story is true).</p>
  
  <p>Barra is the only one reported to die in the books, while in the show
  at least four others of Robert's bastards were killed too.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Gendry is spared from the massacre because Varys had foreseen this</strong>
  <strong>would take place and arranged his escape from the city in Yoren's</strong>
  <strong>caravan.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, the executions took place after the death of Ned Stark(because Arya traveled with Yoren). But they happened , because Cersei was worried about the throne being taking in genereal and not because Joffrey was a bad king. She knew if the truth came out everyone was in danger.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong><em>My personal Non-canon thoughts.</em></strong></p>

<p>I never thought that the bastards had a greater right to the throne than Joffrey. <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Bastardy"" rel=""noreferrer"">If Joffrey didn't get the throne then the throne would have been given to someone else.</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bastards are not allowed to inherit their father's lands or titles,
  and have no claims to the privileges of their father's House. It is up
  to their father on how to raise or treat them: at worst they are
  unacknowledged and ignored, though they may fare better and be
  discreetly sent funds to ensure their well-being. At best, a lord will
  acknowledge his bastard children (allowing them to take on one of the
  special bastard surnames), but send them away to one of his distant
  castles to be raised away from his lawful family.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean things might have differed as since it was a noble house, but there were many others who had stronger claims. And if the pureblood Baratheon son is the king, people are probably going to accept him and not the ""bastards"".And if they don't accept him its because they want to accept someone else, possibly a Barantheon brother, a Tangeryn, or maybe a Stark.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nevertheless, as a highborn bastard carries the blood of a noble
  house, they may still be perceived as a potential threat by rival
  claimants. For this reason, King Joffrey orders the massacre of all of
  his father's illegitimate offspring</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So unless anyone knew about Joffrey being a bastard this wasn't necessary.</p>

"65170","Why did Jeor Mormont keep Longclaw when he took the black?","<p>I can't remember whether Jorah was exiled before or after Jeor abdicated. But whether or not he did, Jeor himself says that it's not good for men of the Night's Watch to return home. If he knew he would not be going back to Bear Island, would it not make more sense for him to leave Longclaw with Jorah or Maege, thus ensuring its continued place as an ancestral sword?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","65174","<p>I believe he had already taken the black and given Jorah Longclaw. But when Jorah was exiled he left the sword behind with his family. In the TV show, Jeor explicitly mentions that ""At least Jorah had the decency to leave it behind."" </p>

<p>Jeor's sister and nieces sent it to him at the Night's Watch. I assume he would have held onto it until one of his nieces had a son, but since he was quite old and they did not seem to be having children he gave it to Jon Snow instead as a gift for saving his life. </p>

"65206","Can one simply leave the Kingsguard?","<p>I was searching for the Kingsguards vow and the only thing I could find was a collection of quotes here: <a href=""http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/87683-the-text-of-the-kingsguard-vow/"" rel=""noreferrer"">westeros.org</a>. There they get to the point where it is not clear if the vow transfers automatically to the heir if the previous king dies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I swore an oath!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To Joffrey, not to Tommen.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aye...&quot;</p>
<p><em>taken from the linked site</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we can assume that IF they don't have to serve the new king automatically, they can decide to leave the Kingsguard once the king they vowed to dies. So that could potentially be one point to get rid of the white cloak.
I have not read the books yet, but in the tv series:</p>
<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
<p> When Tyrion is in trial for killing Joffrey, Jaime offers his father to leave the Kingsguard so he can take his rightful place as the ruler of Casterly Rock if he spares Tyrions life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So: are Kingsguards allowed to leave their position at any time or can they only get out by getting dumped? Is this an exception for the Lord Commander? Or (if the assumption mentioned above is right) do they have to wait for their king to die?</p>
<p>I am asking, because there is so much said about the vow of the Night's Watch in the tv series, but they never say anything about the Kingsguards, at least I do not remember.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","65209","<p>No, their vows are vows for life. They cannot leave/retire.</p>

<p>The king (pretty much does whatever he wants, so he) can dismiss someone off the guard, like Joffrey did with Selmy; or like Tywin wanted to do with Jaime, when the former was king Regent.</p>

"131129","Did Cersei lay out Lancel by punching him in the armor?","<p>In Episode 9, Season 2 of Game of Thrones (Blackwater) at 44:40, we see what appears to be Queen Cersei punching Ser Lancel Lannister in his armored shoulder. She had just ordered Lancel to bring Joffrey to his quarters when the Battle of Blackwater appeared lost. Lancel did not want to, he claimed that the Knights of the Kingsguard lost their fighting spirit when their King wasn't leading them.</p>

<p>I've looked at the scene several times to try to make out a weapon, but I can't see one. Yet, after being punched in the armor by a woman of apparently average strength and size, Lancel writhes on the floor, moaning.</p>

<p>What am I missing?</p>

<p>I don't remember that scene in A Clash of Kings (which I no longer have), but I would happily accept an answer from the book or the series.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","131132","<p>Cersei did not punch his Armor. Cersei deliberately hit him where he had taken a wound during the battle to get him out of her way. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lancel returns to Cersei to warn that they are defeated unless Joffrey

  counsel, pushes him out of the way (<strong>deliberately causing him pain by</strong>
  <strong>hitting his injured side</strong>), and storms out.</p>

  killed in any case, you know that. Let him stay, I’ll keep him by me,
  I swear-”</p>

"65328","Where do soldiers in Westeros come from?","<p>Reading ASOIAF, I've never been quite clear on who the soldiers in armies are, and where they come from. Meribald's speech in AFFC implies that soldiers are pooled from the smallfolk:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Broken men are more deserving of our pity, though they may be just as dangerous. Almost all are common-born, simple folk who had never been more than a mile from the house where they were born until the day <strong>some lord came round to take them off to war</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Emphasis mine.) But this doesn't say a huge amount. Is it indiscriminate - is every fighting man within the lord's lands taken as a soldier? Is it voluntary, or are soldiers conscripted? Do all able-bodied men within the families of the lord and his bannermen fight? I'm looking for more general information about how armies of Westeros are formed.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","65333","<p>Westeros uses a feudal system. Which means that each lord, high or low, has the responsibility of providing fighting men to his liege lord when the call comes. Willing volunteers are of course preferred, but they are often not enough when the conflict is large enough. So the lords conscript from their population. How they do that and how much men they take is up to the individual lord. Usually, it is only the lowest of the low who get conscripted. The unskilled workers, farmers and the poor who have no better prospects. Tradesmen, smiths and artisans are usually far too valuable to use as common soldiers. Which is why lords are usually keen on ending a campaign before harvest time comes, when most of their men would be yearning to go back to their farms. If a lord is rich enough he would bolster this army of smallfolk with his household knights, hedge knights and sellswords.</p>

<p>In the novella <em>Sworn Sword</em> we see this take action (albeit on a very small scale). Dunk and Ser Eustace round up a few able men from their lord's village. Only a few of whom had previous combat experience, and the rest just simple farmer boys who have nothing better to do.</p>

"131259","How many Faceless Men are there?","<p>Considering that a Faceless Man is ""no-one"" and can change appearances at will, is there any mention of how large their order actually is? </p>

<p>For all we know it could just be two people: The Kindly Man and Waif.... </p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","131267","<h2>In the books, at least twelve</h2>
<p>In <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, Arya attends a meeting of eleven Faceless Men:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Eleven servants of the Many-Faced God gathered that night beneath the
temple, more than she had ever seen together at one time</strong>. Only the
lordling and the fat fellow arrived by the front door; the rest came
by secret ways, through tunnels and hidden passages. They wore their
robes of black and white, but as they took their seats each man pulled
his cowl down to show the face he had chosen to wear that day. Their
tall chairs were carved of ebony and weirwood, like the doors of the
temple above. The ebon chairs had weirwood faces on their backs, the
weirwood chairs faces of carved ebony.</p>
<p>—<em>A Dance with Dragons</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This group has some overlap with those Arya has seen before:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After three hours of wine and words, the priests took their leave …
all but <strong>the kindly man, the waif, and the one whose face bore the
marks of plague.</strong></p>
<p>—<em>A Dance with Dragons</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The text seems to indicate that Arya is not counting herself in this number, so that makes a dozen Faceless Men. <strong>We at least know that there are significantly more than two Faceless Men.</strong></p>
<p>Other possible or definite Faceless Men have appeared in the books. Samwell Tarly, for instance, met &quot;Pate&quot; after the real Pate had died, and thus &quot;Pate&quot; was probably a Faceless Man.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“My thanks.” There was something about the pale, soft youth that he
misliked, but he did not want to seem discourteous, so he added, “My
name’s not Slayer, truly. I’m Sam. Samwell Tarly.”</p>
<p>“I’m Pate,” the other said, “like the pig boy.”</p>
<p>—<em>A Feast for Crows</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, given that eleven is the maximum number of Faceless Men ever mentioned to be <em>in one place</em> at the same time, we cannot assume that there are more based on other individuals seen in the books, given the well-known propensity of the Faceless Men for disguise.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that the previous passage suggests that the Faceless Men are not much more numerous, since eleven is the most Arya has ever seen together.</p>
<h2>In the TV series, at least three</h2>
<p>In the TV series <em>Game of Thrones</em>, we know of three Faceless Men:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arya Stark</li>
<li>The Waif</li>
<li>&quot;Jaqen H'ghar&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Given that the Waif and Jaqen appear at the same time, we know they are different people. We can also assume that neither of them is Arya Stark, making three.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The <em>Fight Club</em> Theory:</strong> Some fans suggest that Arya and the Waif are not actually nemeses, but the same person, with the Waif being the Tyler Durden to Arya's Edward Norton. The meat of this theory is that the Waif and Arya represent her two possible paths - becoming No One and embracing her born identity - and that all the fights between Arya and the Waif are her inner struggles literalized. That would make the Waif's attack on Arya a (failed) last-ditch effort to kill her emotions and officially become No One.</p>

"65468","When to start watching HBO's Game of Thrones when reading the books?","<p>I've started reading George R. R. Martin's ""<em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>"" book series, and I intend to watch HBO's television series based on it at some point. I wonder about two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Should I start watching the series before having finished all the books? </li>
<li>If so, which chapters should I have read? What is a good starting point?</li>
</ul>

<p>The point is obviously avoiding spoilers.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","65476","<p>The 100% guaranteed way to ensure the show doesn't spoil anything from the books is to read them all first. That should go without saying, and that's the path I recommend. But if you insist on jumping into the show while you're still reading, here's a rough guide.</p>

<p>There's a pretty strong correlation between the first two books and the first two seasons. Season One, in particular, is almost a word-for-word adaptation in many parts. You could probably start watching those immediately after reading the respective books.</p>

<p>Season 3 is where things get tricky. Individual storylines differ in pacing. For example, Bran's <em>Storm of Swords</em> storyline is completely finished by the end of Season 3, while Jon Snow's only ends up about 1/3 completed. Things get even murkier in Season 4, when several characters start to make significant inroads to their <em>Feast for Crows</em>/<em>Dance with Dragons</em> storylines.</p>

<p>I'd recommend <em>at least</em> reading all the way through <em>Storm of Swords</em> before tacking Season Three, since Bran and Jaime's entire arc is in Season Three. In addition, episode one reveals something crucial about the character Arstan Whitebeard that is a mystery throughout the book.</p>

<p>But I strongly recommend reading <em>all</em> the books before starting Season Three. Season Three immediately reveals the fate of a major character whose fate is a mystery for two whole books.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Theon</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I definitely, definitely recommend reading all the books before Season Four. Dany, Bran, Brienne, and the spoilered character above all have parts of their <em>Feast for Crows</em>/<em>Dance with Dragons</em> storylines in that season.</p>

<p>EDIT: One thing I should add is that the show often makes things explicit which, in the books, are only hinted at or revealed over time. This happens as early as the first two seasons, in which much of ambiguity behind characters like Littlefinger and Margaery Tyrell are stripped away. They aren't spoilers, per se, but it could diminish your enjoyment in reading the books.</p>

<p>I'm looking for cogent, reasonable theories, or if you have quotes from GRRM that explain this, that would be even better.</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","65677","<p>In fact, there is. George R.R. Martin has very specifically answered this question.</p>
<p>In <a href=""http://observationdeck.io9.com/george-r-r-martin-the-complete-unedited-interview-886117845"" rel=""noreferrer"">this</a> interview with Charlie Jane Anders, GRRM says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I get complaints sometimes that nothing happens(in AFFC) — but they're
defining &quot;nothing,&quot; I think, differently than I am. I don't think it
all has to battles and sword fights and assassinations. Character
development and [people] changing is good, and there are some tough
things in there that I think a lot of writers skip over. I'm glad I
didn't skip over these things.</p>

<p>Coming the point of this question, he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And that has been interesting, you know. Jon Snow as Lord Commander.
Dany as Queen, struggling with rule. So many books don't do that.
There is a sense when you're writing something in high fantasy, you're
in a dialogue with all the other high fantasy writers that have
written. And there is always this presumption that if you are a good
man, you will be a good king. [Like] Tolkien — in Return of the King,
Aragorn comes back and becomes king, and then [we read that] &quot;he ruled
wisely for three hundred years.&quot; Okay, fine. It is easy to write that
sentence, “He ruled wisely”.</p>
<p>What does that mean, he ruled wisely? What were his tax policies? What
did he do when two lords were making war on each other? Or barbarians
were coming in from the North? What was his immigration policy? What
about equal rights for Orcs? I mean did he just pursue a genocidal
policy, &quot;Let’s kill all these fucking Orcs who are still left over&quot;?
Or did he try to redeem them? You never actually see the nitty-gritty
of ruling.</p>
<p>I guess there is an element of fantasy readers that don't want to see
that. I find that fascinating. Seeing someone like Dany actually
trying to deal with the vestments of being a queen and getting
factions and guilds and [managing the] economy. They burnt all the
fields [in Meereen]. They've got nothing to import any more. They're
not getting any money. I find this stuff interesting.</p>

Just being a good guy was not the answer. You had to make hard, hard
decisions. Sometimes what seemed to be a good decision turned around
and bit you in the ass; it was the law of unintended consequences.
I've tried to get at some of these in my books. My people who are
trying to rule don't have an easy time of it. Just having good
intentions  doesn't make you a wise king.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TL;DR;</strong> A good human being doesn't translate into a good king. Dany is good, just, ambitious, wants to end slavery &amp; give freedom to the oppressed. She does that, but what happens after that? What happens to the oppressed and enslaved after they gain freedom? How does she rule a kingdom when she wins it?</p>

<p>Is there any <em>direct</em> evidence in the novels to support this theory, apart from the mostly circumstantial and/or coincidental evidence listed in the thread? Alternatively, is there anything in the novels that definitively rules out the possibility that they are the same person (e.g. they were in two different places at once or some other contradictions?)</p>

<p>To summarize the Reddit thread, in brief, the evidence in support of the theory is:</p>

<ul>
<li>GRRM has said there is ""something more"" to Daario Naharis.</li>
<li>Dario and Euron look similar</li>
<li>The periods where each character is 'on-screen' line up with periods where the other character's whereabouts are unknown.</li>
<li>There is a significant gap between sighting of each character, long enough to travel back and forth.</li>
<li>Bits of evidence linking Euron to Dany and Daario to Dany that make them seem like the same person.</li>
</ul>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","65699","<p>The biggest problem with this theory is getting the timeline to work. The reddit thread you link says that ""It's implied that Euron's using quarthian warlock magick while sailing, so anything makes sense chronologically."" Yeeeah, citation needed. Euron did intend capture Qaathan warlocks, but there's never any implication they can control the wind to make ships move quickly. If they could, obviously he wouldn't have been able to capture their ship.</p>

<p>The Iron Islands and Meereen are very, very far away, and ships travel slowly. It took three and a half days for Stannis' fleet to get from Dragonstone to King's Landing, and they're practically right next to each other. Even when Melisandre uses her fire magic to summon favorable winds, it take Stannis weeks to reach the Wall.</p>

<p>Setting aside whether or not travel over that distance is possible, communication is virtually impossible. It takes months for Dany to learn that King Robert is dead. But in <em>A Dance With Dragons</em>, Dany recalls Daario from his mission with the Lamb Men, and he returns fairly promptly. Even IF Euron was capable of moving so quickly across an entire continent (doubtful), there's no way he'd be able to receive the message in the Shield Islands AND move so quickly across an entire continent.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/i8n8E.jpg"" alt="".""></p>

<p>The small little red line is Stannis' trip to King's Landing, which took half a week. The big yellow line is Euron/Daario's supposed commute. A more dedicated man than I created a <a href=""http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/84563-most-precise-asoiaf-timeline-in-existence/"" rel=""noreferrer"">pretty comprehensive ASOIAF timeline</a>, which estimates that it took months for Victarion to cross the shorter distance between Meereen and the Shield Islands. Magic can only do so much.</p>

<p>Basically, the only way to make the theory work is assume there is lots and lots of magic involved, glass candles, glamours or face changing, some hitherto unknown Qartheen magic. It's so much easier to say that two characters who have nothing to do with each other are, in fact, two characters with nothing to do with each other.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And Stannis has always felt he was cheated of Storm's End,&quot; Cersei said thoughtfully. &quot;The ancestral seat of House Baratheon, his by rights... if you knew how many times he came to Robert singing that same dull song in that gloomy aggrieved tone he has. When Robert gave the place to Renly, Stannis clenched his jaw so tight I thought his teeth would shatter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He took it as a slight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was meant as a slight,&quot; Cersei said.</p>
<p><sub>A Clash of Kings, Tyrion VI</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Certainly this is a timely conversation, as they have just received word that the two brothers are confronting each other. But, Cersei is just stating her opinion.</p>
<p>Is there any evidence one way or another that Robert intended to slight Stannis by giving him Dragonstone instead of Storm's End?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","65705","<p>There are many reasons given for why Robert gave Stannis Dragonstone, and all of them are plausible. It's possible the first two reasons I list informed Robert's decision, but the last one is definitely true according to George R.R. Martin.</p>

<p><strong>As a slight</strong>- Robert clearly didn't like Stannis all that much, and the feeling was mutual. But at the same time, he also says he never cared all that much for Renly, either. So it isn't clear why he would stiff his adult brother in favor of a much younger brother he disliked slightly less (especially given Stannis' excellent job in defending Storm's End throughout the war).</p>

<p>Stannis and Cersei both think this is the reason why Stannis was given Dragonstone. In particular, Stannis believes that Robert blamed him for letting Viserys and Dany escape the fortress. </p>

<p><strong>Practicality</strong>- Dragonstone was a hotbed of Targeryen loyalists, and their ancestral seat before Aegon's Conquest. One reason given for Stannis' appointment as Lord of Dragonstone was that it needed a strong head to watch over it. In addition, Stannis was Robert's master of ships. It makes sense that he'd be positioned at the island that has traditionally protected King's Landing from naval invasions.</p>

<p>This seems to be the reason Robert gave to Stannis:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I never asked for Dragonstone. I never wanted it. I took it because Robert’s enemies were here and he commanded me to root them out. I built his fleet and did his work, dutifully as a younger brother should be to an elder, as Renly should be to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>To honor him</strong>- Believe it or not, this is the canon reason. Dragonstone was traditionally given to the Targeryen prince who would one day rule the realm. That why Rhaegar Targeryan (and Baelor in <em>The Hedge Knight</em>) was styled the ""Prince of Dragonstone"" . So by granting Stannis Dragonstone, Robert intended to designate him heir to the throne, before Joffrey came into the picture.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/The_Baratheon_Brothers/"">From the mouth of GRRM</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stannis always resented being given Dragonstone while Renly got Storm's End, and took that as a slight... but it's not necessarily true that Robert meant it that way. The Targaryen heir apparent had always been titled Prince of Dragonstone. By making Stannis the Lord of Dragonstone, Robert affirmed his brother's status as heir (which he was, until Joff's birth a few years later). Robert could just as lawfully retained both castles for his sons, and made Joffrey the Prince of Dragonstone and Tommen the Lord of Storm's End. Giving them to his brothers instead was another instance of his great, but rather careless, generosity.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Sandor is wounded in the riverlands, and Arya leaves him there to die.</p>

<p>But is that it? What happens to him afterwards?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","65753","<p>We find out what happened to Sandor ""The Hound"" Clegane in a Brienne chapter in <em>A Feast for Crows</em>. We are first served some clues, then told outright. First we see Sandor's horse, <em>Stranger</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Way down at the far end [of the stables], well away from the other animals, a huge black stallion trumpeted at the sound of their voices and kicked at the door of his stall.<br>
  Ser Hyle gave the big horse an admiring look as he was handing his reins to Brother Gilliam. ""A handsome beast.""<br>
  Brother Narbert sighed. ""The Seven send us blessings, and the Seven send us trials. Handsome he might be, but Driftwood was surely whelped in hell. When we sought to harness him to a plow he kicked Brother Rawney and broke his shinbone in two places. We had hoped gelding might improve the beast's ill temper, but... Brother Gilliam, will you show them?""<br>
  [shows the horse bit off his ear]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then we see Sandor himself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...and higher still they passed a lichyard where a brother bigger than Brienne was struggling to dig a grave. From the way he moved, it was plain to see that he was lame. As he flung a spadeful of the stony soil over one shoulder, some chanced to spatter against their feet. ""Be more watchful there,"" chided Brother Narbert. ""Septon Meribald might have gotten a mouthful of dirt."" The gravedigger lowered his head. When Dog [Septon Meribald's dog] went to sniff him he dropped his spade and scratched his ear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And later on, clues of the Elder Brother's involvement with Sandor:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unlike Septon Narbert, the Elder Brother did not seem dismayed by Brienne's sex, but his smile did flicker and fade when the septon told them why she and Ser Hyle had come. ""I see,"" was all he said, ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We get confirmation that the Elder Brother has met Sandor:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...There is one thing I do know, however. The man you hunt is dead.""<br>
  That was another shock. ""How did he die?""<br>
  ""By the sword, as he had lived.""<br>
  ""You know this for a certainty?""<br>
  ""I buried him myself. I can tell you where his grave lies, if you wish. I covered him with stones to keep the carrion eaters from digging up his flesh, and set his helm atop the cairn to mark his final resting place. That was a grievous error. Some other wayfarer found my marker and claimed it for himself. The man who raped and killed at Saltpans was not Sandor Clegane, though he may be as dangerous. [Note: It was Rorge]<br>
  ...<br>
  I know little of this man, Sandor Clegane, ...<br></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The brother claims that ""The Hound"" is dead, but when reading between the lines, it is clear that what he means is that Sandor Clegane has left his violent persona behind him.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... The Hound died there, in my arms. You may have seen a big black stallion in our stables. That was his warhorse, Stranger. A blasphemous name. We prefer to call him Driftwood, as he was found beside the river.<br>
  ...<br>
  ...""It is true, then."" [Brienne] said dully. ""Sandor Clegane is dead."" <br>
  ""He is at rest."" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Elder Brother then relates a story about himself being a knight, and being wounded on the Trident during the famous Battle of the Trident between Robert and Rhaegar, and finding his way to the Quiet Isle, where he found redemption. He finishes with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I see."" Brienne did not know why he was telling her all of this, or what else she ought to say.<br>
  ""Do you?"" He leaned forward, his big hands on his knees. ""If so, give up this quest of yours. The Hound is dead, and in any case he never had your Sansa Stark.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is clear that Sandor lives, when reading this chapter. One can only hope that he does not stay there for a decade, like the Elder Brother. My personal hope is that he is reunited with one of the main characters, and becomes their guardian, preferably Sansa. Others have theorized that he will become a champion of the Light, and fight UnGregor in Cersei's Trial by Combat. Whatever the outcome, it is sure to be interesting.</p>

"131815","If a Faceless Man killed someone who is then brought back to life, does it count?","<p>I was wondering if there was any canon that would lead one to believe one way or the other. Since the Many-Faced demands a life and one was taken, has the Faceless Man fulfilled his task? Or, since the Many-Faced God is <em>all</em> gods, does R'hollor's allowing him/her to come back just cancel it out?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","131843","<p>No, as of now, there is no canon information from the books in this regard because there has never been a case where a man killed by Faceless men was resurrected by priests of R'hllor. </p>

<p>Therefore the following answer will be informed speculation, based on reasoning from canon material:</p>

<h2>Who gets resurrected by R'hllor?</h2>

<p>R'hllor does not grant his gift of a second chance at life to everyone. Only those people are sent back for whom he still holds some purpose in life. The only known resurrection cases in the books are Lord <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Beric_Dondarrion"">Beric Dondarrion</a> and Lady <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Catelyn_Tully"">Catelyn Stark</a>. </p>

<p>From A Storm of Swords, Chapter 39, Arya's POV:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Could you bring back a man without a head?” Arya asked. “Just the
  once, not six times. Could you?”</p>
  
  <p>“I have no magic, child. Only prayers. That first time, his lordship
  had a hole right through him and blood in his mouth, I knew there was
  no hope. So when his poor torn chest stopped moving, I gave him the
  good god’s own kiss to send him on his way. I filled my mouth with
  fire and breathed the flames inside him, down his throat to lungs and
  heart and soul. The last kiss it is called, and <strong>many a time I saw the</strong>
  <strong>old priests bestow it on the Lord’s servants as they died</strong>. <strong>I had given</strong>
  <strong>it a time or two myself, as all priests must.</strong> But never before had I
  felt a dead man shudder as the fire filled him, nor seen his eyes come
  open. <strong>It was not me who raised him, my lady. It was the Lord.
  R’hllor is not done with him yet</strong>. Life is warmth, and warmth is
  fire, and fire is God’s and God’s alone.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see, Thoros of Myr had performed the ritual many time and it never resurrected anyone. But when he did it with Beric Dondarrion, he rose up. Because R'hllor was not done with him yet. </p>

<p>It is highly unlikely that someone chosen to be killed by FM would also turn out to be someone who was chosen by R'hllor to do something. It is also unlikely that a man slain by faceless men would have a Red priest around to perform the ritual. </p>

<h2>Red God's due &amp; beliefs of Facelessmen</h2>

<p>Jaqen said to Arya:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The Red God has his due, sweet girl, and only death may pay for life. This girl took three that were his. This girl must give three in
  their places.</strong> Speak the names, and a man will do the rest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in order to repay a debt of life, Faceless Men have to pay back with equal number of lives. </p>

<p>Faceless men give death as a gift. It is not a duty or anything else in literal sense of a duty. Someone goes to their temple and pays ridiculous costs for the gift (Either for himself or someone else) &amp; faceless men handle the rest. If they kill someone and he dies, duty of the Faceless men is done. They have given the gift and that's all what matters. </p>

<p>In AFFC, The Kindly Man tells Arya:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“And many names,” the kindly man had said. “In Qohor he is the Black
  Goat, in Yi Ti the Lion of Night, in Westeros the Stranger. <strong>All men
  must bow to him in the end, no matter if they worship the Seven or the
  Lord of Light</strong>, the Moon Mother or the Drowned God or the Great
  Shepherd. All mankind belongs to him... else somewhere in the world
  would be a folk who lived forever. Do you know of any folk who live
  forever?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The correlation between Many Faced God and R'hllor can be stated as ambigious from this source. It is not clear whether they consider R'hllor as another face of MFG or do they consider him a distinct deity. Nevertheless, If they gave the gift to their target and he died, their job is done. They bargained for one life &amp; one life was taken. If R'hllor gives a new life to their target, it should not be any of their concern. The Faceless Men take the count of the slain very seriously (Though exceptions are made if their own life is threatened). From ACOK, When Arya threatens to name Jaqen if he did not help her free the Northmen, He says that it would mean more than three deaths and gods will not be pleased. Nevertheless he agrees after Arya's threat. Afterwards, he said this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I take back the name.” Arya chewed her lip. “Do I still have a third
  death?”</p>
  
  <p>“A girl is greedy.” Jaqen touched one of the dead guards and showed
  her his bloody fingers. “Here is three and there is four and eight
  more lie dead below. The debt is paid.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In conclusion no I don't believe that FM would take a hit on a resurrected man because they have done their job of giving the gift already. If the man is dead, that's good enough for them. </p>

<p>Also, resurrection after death is considered a new life (In show canon), Which is evident because Jon considered himself free of Night's Watch vows after he was resurrected.</p>

  <p>There will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In season 6's seventh and eighth episodes it looks like another person is directed to becoming Azor Ahai's revenant.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> The Hound is affected by fire since his childhood, he survived a trial by battle against reviving Beric Dondarrion, he is still living because a priest healed him and now it's very likely that he joins R'hllor's forces besides the Red Priest. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So is it possible that reborn Azor Ahai and The Prince That Was Promised are two different persons? Or what is the evidence that it's the same person?</p>

<p>Clarification: I'm only asking about the prophecies, not about who the person(s) will be.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","131944","<p>Yes both prophecies refer to the same figure with different names. Following is the evidence:</p>

<h2>Role of different cultures and their languages</h2>

<p>Azor Ahai and Prince that was promised apparently refer to same prophetic figure. They are just different names used by different cultures to refer to one supposed figure who would lead the men into Battle for the Dawn. People of Asshai call him Azor Ahai and People of Westeros call him Prince that was promised.</p>

<p>According to the World of Ice and Fire, In some other culture, legends point to the same figure with different names such as Hyrkoon the Hero, Yin Tar, Neferion, and Eldric Shadowchaser.</p>

<h2>Melisandre's conversation with Maester Aemon</h2>

<p>There is not much information available about TPTWP as compared to AA. By the description she gave for Azor Ahai's duty, Maester Aemon quickly knew that she was talking about TPTWP and Battle for the Dawn. </p>

<p>From ASOS, Chapter 78, Sam's POV:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Swords alone cannot hold this darkness back. Only the light of the
  Lord can do that. Make no mistake, good sers and valiant brothers, the
  war we’ve come to fight is no petty squabble over lands and honors.
  Ours is a war for life itself, and should we fail the world dies with
  us.”</p>
  
  <p>The officers did not know how to take that, Sam could see. Bowen Marsh
  and Othell Yarwyck exchanged a doubtful look, Janos Slynt was fuming,
  and Three-Finger Hobb looked as though he would sooner be back
  chopping carrots. </p>
  
  <p>But all of them seemed surprised to hear Maester Aemon murmur, “<strong>It
  is the war for the dawn you speak of, my lady. But where is the prince
  that was promised?</strong>”</p>
  
  <p>“<strong>He stands before you</strong>,” Melisandre declared, “though you do not have
  the eyes to see. <strong>Stannis Baratheon is Azor Ahai come again, the
  warrior of fire. In him the prophecies are fulfilled. The red comet
  blazed across the sky to herald his coming, and he bears Lightbringer,
  the red sword of heroes.</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice that Aemon asked who was TPTWP. Mel replied that Stannis was Azor Ahai. Which means they must be the same person. Later Maester Aemon does not say that if they are different figures or not, he just asks to see Stannis's magical sword Light Bringer. He saw it and left. Afterwards when he was dying, He told Sam this, In AFFC Chapter 35:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sword is wrong, she has to know that ... light without heat ... an
  empty glamour ... the sword is wrong, and the false light can only
  lead us deeper into darkness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He did not say that Melisandre was wrong to consider AA and TPTWP to be same persons, He just says that she has the sword wrong. Which means that TPTWP must also posses the same sword and characteristics.</p>

<h2>The Sword</h2>

<p>By what we know of TPTWP, We know that he must be a Warrior, so he must need a sword. Back when Rhaegar used to think he was TPTWP, he said this to Master-at-arms of KL:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I will require a sword and armor. It seems I must be a warrior.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And we know AA forged his own magical sword to slay the darkness (By plunging the sword into heart of his beloved wife to temper it). </p>

<h2>So Spake Martin</h2>

<p>In GoT Season-2 DVD Extras GRRM also used the word in a similar way. He said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He [Stannis] is discarding the gods that he has worshiped since his
  childhood and accepting the red god and giving himself to the lord of
  light. And in return, <strong>Melisandre sees that the lord of light gives
  him a token of his role as the prince that was promised by an ancient
  prophecy</strong>. And of course, that's his sword Lightbringer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice that Mel usually refers to Stannis as Azor Ahai, but George states that Mel sees him as TPTWP. That should clear it all up.</p>

"131915","Is Jaqen breaking the rules when he gives Arya the coin?","<p>In <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2112510/"">Season 2 Episode 10</a> , Jaqen says to Arya</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""To be a dancing master is a special thing, but... to be a Faceless Man... that is something else entirely. A girl has many names on her lips. Joffrey. Cersei. Tywin Lannister. Ilyn Payne. The Hound. Names to offer up to the Red God. She could offer them all. One by one."" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>By this, it seems that he is willing to allow Arya to use the House of Black and White for training in the art of 'giving the gift of the Many-Faced God' to kill for her own ends, but in the name of the god. It seems like it would go against his beliefs. </p>

<p>Any insight?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","131947","<p>Axelrod has provided a comprehensive answer, I will compound on that. </p>

<p>It's all there in the quote you mentioned:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""To be a dancing master is a special thing, but... to be a Faceless
  Man... that is something else entirely. A girl has many names on her
  lips. Joffrey. Cersei. Tywin Lannister. Ilyn Payne. The Hound. <strong>Names
  to offer up to the Red God. She could offer them all. One by one.</strong>""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jaqen is not breaking any rules by telling Arya that she can offer the names to the Many Faced God. He is not telling her that she can go kill them herself just like that or that she can use the order's training to achieve her goals. He is specifically telling her to follow the due process of offering the names and in an implied way pay the due price for each of the murder (Because that's what you gotta do when you offer a name).</p>

<p>The price is always the part of the said ""gift"". Anyone can ask for the gift of death either for himself, his loved ones or his enemies. Then the Faceless Men tell him the price to give that gift. One crucial aspect of the price is that it is always something that the applicant can pay, there is no fixed price list. </p>

<p>George R.R. Martin <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/The_Cost_of_Faceless_Men"">explained it in this way</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Faceless Men don't post a list of prices on their door. The way it
  works, you go to them and tell them who you want killed, and then they
  negotiate the price. The more prominent the victim, the more difficult
  to get to, the more dangerous for the assassin and the guild, the
  higher the price</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Price is also explained in story of the Waif in AFFC Chapter 34, Cat of the Canals:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I was born the only child of an ancient House, my noble father’s
  heir,” the waif replied. “My mother died when I was little, I have no
  memory of her. When I was six my father wed again. His new wife
  treated me kindly until she gave birth to a daughter of her own. Then
  it was her wish that I should die, so her own blood might inherit my
  father’s wealth. <strong>She should have sought the favor of the Many-Faced
  God, but she could not bear the sacrifice he would ask of her</strong>.
  Instead, she thought to poison me herself. It left me as you see me
  now, but I did not die. <strong>When the healers in the House of the Red
  Hands told my father what she had done, he came here and made
  sacrifice, offering up all his wealth and me. Him of Many Faces heard
  his prayer. I was brought to the temple to serve, and my father’s wife
  received the gift</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it is clear that Price is steep enough to make any applicant reconsider his request but it is always within the means of the applicant. Waif's stepmother could not pay the price. But her father offered all his wealth and his daughter as a servant for the gift of death for his wife. The FLM accepted his offering and killed his wife. Later Waif confirmed that FLM did not ask for all the wealth of her father, they just asked for his 2/3rd wealth and his daughter as price. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She had been watching the waif’s face the whole time she told her
  story, but the other girl had shown her no signs. </p>
  
  <p>“The Many-Faced God took two-thirds of your father’s wealth, not all.” </p>
  
  <p>“Just so. That was my exaggeration.”</p>

However, what is clear is <em>why</em> Robb decided to wed in the first place...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;I took her castle and she took my heart.&quot; Robb smiled.</strong> &quot;The Crag was weakly garrisoned, so we took it by storm one night. Black Walder and the Smalljon led scaling parties over the walls, while I broke the main gate with a ram. I took an arrow in the arm just before Ser Rolph yielded us the castle.

<p><strong>Catelyn did not need to be told what sort of comfort Jeyne Westerling had offered her son. &quot;And you wed her the next day.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>He looked her in the eyes, proud and miserable all at once. <strong>&quot;It was the only honorable thing to do.</strong> She's gentle and sweet, Mother, she will make me a good wife.&quot;</p>
<p><sub>A Storm of Swords - Catelyn II</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Robb bed a woman... so what? Why did he feel he needed to marry this woman? This is what got me thinking if Robb had bed other women prior to Jeyne. I know the Starks are full of honor, but being around Theon who beds whores like its his job, and being raised with Jon whom was born out of wedlock by their own father (or so everyone believed), surely Robb would not have had that impression right?</p>
<p>I see basically two options 1) Robb and Jeyne were both virgins and somehow this affected the decision or 2) because Jeyne is highborn different rules apply than whores or tavern wenches. So to bring it full circle...</p>
<p><strong>Was Rob Stark a virgin prior to when he met, bed, and married Jeyne Westerling?</strong></p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><character-motivation>","197760","<p>There is nothing explicitly mentioned in the books regarding Robb's love life prior to Jeyne Westerling but there are implications that go both way. </p>

<p>First of all we have to see his relationship with Theon Greyjoy. Theon and Robb were best friends and as close as brothers to each other. Theon was no stranger to bedding serving girls and he and Robb apparently used to discuss the girls afterwards. The passage cited below, describing one such instance. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two serving wenches stood beneath the sign of the Smoking Log, the
  local alehouse. When Theon Greyjoy called out to them, the younger
  girl turned red and covered her face. Theon spurred his mount to move
  up beside Robb. <strong>""Sweet Kyra,"" he said with a laugh. ""She squirms like
  a weasel in bed, but say a word to her on the street, and she blushes
  pink as a maid. Did I ever tell you about the night that she and
  Bessa—""</strong></p>
  
  <p><strong>""Not where my brother can hear, Theon,"" Robb warned him with a glance
  at Bran.</strong></p>
  
  <p>Bran looked away and pretended not to have heard, but he could feel
  Greyjoy's eyes on him. No doubt he was smiling. He smiled a lot, as if
  the world were a secret joke that only he was clever enough to
  understand. Robb seemed to admire Theon and enjoy his company, but
  Bran had never warmed to his father's ward.<br><sub><strong>AGOT - Bran V</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It looked like Theon had forgotten that Bran was with them and Robb didn't want him to listen to all the <em>adult talk</em>. Now this can be interpreted both ways. One could be that they used to share their exploits with each other. Or that Robb was that one virgin friend who loves to listen his best friend talk about his sexual conquests. Jon Snow was Robb's best friend too but Jon's much more solemn in nature and has an aversion to anything that leads to making bastards due to his personal experiences, so it is understandable why he was not included in these talks. Not to mention, Jon never got along with Theon.</p>

<p>Then we have Catelyn's account which implies that serving girls in Winterfell were very much attracted to Robb, the young heir to the North. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robb got to his feet slowly and sheathed his sword, and <strong>Catelyn found
  herself wondering whether her son had ever kissed a girl in the
  godswood. Surely he must have. She had seen Jeyne Poole giving him
  moist-eyed glances, and some of the serving girls, even ones as old as
  eighteen</strong> … he had ridden in battle and killed men with a sword, surely
  he had been kissed. There were tears in her eyes. She wiped them away
  angrily.<br><sub><strong>AGOT - Catelyn XI</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>They were not the only ones, Princess Myrcella kept staring at Robb during the feast at Winterfell and Robb was grinning like an idiot when he got to escort Myrcella to her seat prior to that. It was as if he (13?) had never had a girl (8-9?) touch his arm before. But just the fact that Jeyne Poole or serving girls were interested in him doesn't really say if Robb returned their affections. Nor does the thing with Myrcella who was way too young and probably didn't understand all that anyways. </p>

<p>Finally we have his one explicit sexual encounter, that was with Jeyne Westerling.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""<strong>I took her castle and she took my heart.</strong>"" Robb smiled. ""The Crag was
  weakly garrisoned, so we took it by storm one night. Black Walder and
  the Smalljon led scaling parties over the walls, while I broke the
  main gate with a ram. I took an arrow in the arm just before Ser Rolph
  yielded us the castle. It seemed nothing at first, but it festered.
  Jeyne had me taken to her own bed, and she nursed me until the fever
  passed. And she was with me when the Greatjon brought me the news of .
  . . of Winterfell. Bran and Rickon."" He seemed to have trouble saying
  his brothers' names. ""<strong>That night, she . . . she comforted me, Mother.</strong>""</p>
  
  <p>Catelyn did not need to be told what sort of comfort Jeyne Westerling
  had offered her son. ""And you wed her the next day."" He looked her in
  the eyes, proud and miserable all at once.</p>
  
  <p>""<strong>It was the only honorable thing to do. She's gentle and sweet,
  Mother, she will make me a good wife.</strong>""<br><sub><strong>ASOS - Catelyn II</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This folly seems to imply that Robb was not used to bedding women and then leaving them at all and Jeyne might as well have been his first. He risked his life, his family and his kingdom for the ""Honourable thing"", something you don't expect a man, well let's say more experienced in the ways of the world, would. Of course there's a possibility that he genuinely fell helplessly in love with her, but he doesn't mention that emphatically when he gives his reasons to his mother. If it was all about love, he would not have mentioned how she comforted him and he had no other choice. It is also possible that Jeyne was the first noble woman he had laid with, the first one with whom he could hope to have a future so she was different from serving girls and peasants. But it still doesn't make sense to lose everything for her. To quote Jaime:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She did not look dangerous. Jeyne was a willowy girl, no more than
  fifteen or sixteen, more awkward than graceful. She had narrow hips,
  breasts the size of apples, a mop of chestnut curls, and the soft
  brown eyes of a doe. <strong>Pretty enough for a child, Jaime decided, but not
  a girl to lose a kingdom for</strong>.<br><sub><strong>AFFC - Jaime VII</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's what Jaime says on the matter, a guy who is hopelessly in love and has never been with anyone except one woman and even he realises how much of a folly was it. That's absolutely not something you expect from a man who is used to do that.</p>

<p>So in conclusion, there is no conclusive and explicit evidence for or against this. Robb may or may not have been a virgin. The evidence, or lack thereof, compels me to argue that until better evidence appears, we should assume that he was a virgin. </p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","132506","<p>First of all we need to understand what was the extent of the said <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Wildfire_plot"">plot</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aerys_II_Targaryen"">Aerys II</a> had placed wildfire caches on all key positions of the city which primarily included the city gates, Red Keep, Great Sept of Baelor and Dragonpit.</p>

<p>No one except chosen members of the Pyromancers, King Aerys &amp; Jaime Lannister knew about it. <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Qarlton_Chelsted"">Lord Chelsted</a> came to suspect the plot and was burnt for trying to dissuade Aerys from using it. </p>

<p>Jaime later killed Aerys, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rossart"">Rosart</a>, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Garigus"">Garigus</a>, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Belis"">Belis</a> and other pyromancers involved in the plot but he never asked them about the locations of the said caches. </p>

<p>From ASOS:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When I came on <strong>Rossart</strong>, he was dressed as a common man-at-arms,
  hurrying to a postern gate. <strong>I slew him first</strong>. <strong>Then I slew
  Aerys</strong>, before he could find someone else to carry his message to the
  pyromancers. <strong>Days later, I hunted down the others and slew them as
  well</strong>. Belis offered me gold, and Garigus wept for mercy. Well, a
  sword’s more merciful than fire, but I don’t think Garigus much
  appreciated the kindness I showed him.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means among the living people, except Jaime and Brienne no one has a clue about this last madness of King Aerys. </p>

<p>Later, Tyrion found out only the cache beneath the dragonpit. That means, the other caches are still soundly in place.</p>

<p>From ACOK:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This cannot be true,” said Tyrion as he pored over the ledgers.
  “<strong>Almost thirteen thousand jars?</strong> Do you take me for a fool? I’m not
  about to pay the king’s gold for empty jars and pots of sewage sealed
  with wax, I warn you.”</p>
  
  <p>“No, no,” Hallyne squeaked, “the sums are accurate, I swear. We have
  been, hmmm, most fortunate, my lord Hand. <strong>Another cache of Lord
  Rossart’s was found, more than three hundred jars. Under the
  Dragonpit!</strong> Some whores have been using the ruins to entertain their
  patrons, and one of them fell through a patch of rotted floor into a
  cellar. When he felt the jars, he mistook them for wine. He was so
  drunk he broke the seal and drank some.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this quote uses the word <strong>another</strong>. Which means some of the caches were discovered previously, of which we do not know about. Nevertheless, it is safe to assume that most of the caches will be intact.</p>

<p>Other than that, there is also another intriguing thing. How much did Varys know? His little birds must have observed pyromancers coming and going. If that was enough to make a man like Lord Chelsted suspicious, surely Varys must have been so as well. Later, we know Varys knows many of the secrets of the red keep including secret passages. He might have discovered some of those caches beneath the palace himself.</p>

  queen had killed them both. Would I do any less for my own? Catelyn
  clenched her hands, feeling the tightness in her scarred fingers where
  the assassin’s steel had cut to the bone as she fought to save her
  son. <strong>“Bran knows too,” she whispered</strong>, lowering her head. Gods be
  good, <strong>he must have seen something, heard something</strong>, that was why they
  tried to kill him in his bed.</p>

<p>While She harbored doubts about Bran's accident since the second attempt, she was not sure until she talked with Jaime in ACOK:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jaime drank some more wine. “Ask your next.”</p>
  
  <p>Catelyn wondered if he would dare answer her next question with
  anything but a lie. <strong>“How did my son Bran come to fall?”</strong></p>
  
  <p><strong>“I flung him from a window.”</strong></p>
  
  <p>The easy way he said it took her voice away for an instant. If I had a
  knife, I would kill him now, she thought, until she remembered the
  girls. Her throat constricted as she said, “You were a knight, sworn

<li><strong>Brienne of Tarth:</strong></li>

<p>Brienne was standing outside Jaime's cell when Catelyn made Jaime confess about throwing Bran out of the window. Brienne heard everything. From ASOS, Brienne tells Jaime that she heard everything:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Talk with Ser Cleos then. I have no words for monsters.”</p>
  
  <p>Jaime hooted. “Are there monsters hereabouts? Hiding beneath the
  water, perhaps? In that thick of willows? And me without my sword!”</p>
  
  <p>“A man who would violate his own sister, murder his king, and <strong>fling
  an innocent child to his death</strong> deserves no other name.”</p>

<li><strong>Bran:</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Bran himself knows what happened that day and who flung him. The memory came back to him when Clay Cerwyn came to visit Winterfell and his retinue mentioned incest and Lannisters.</p>

<p>From ACOK:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“He’s a king now too,” Cley confided. “He says Queen Cersei bedded her
  brother, so Joffrey is a bastard.”</p>
  
  <p>“Joffrey the Illborn,” one of the Cerwyn knights growled. “Small
  wonder he’s faithless, with the Kingslayer for a father.”</p>
  
  <p>“Aye,” said another, “the gods hate incest. Look how they brought down
  the Targaryens.”</p>
  
  <p>For a moment Bran felt as though he could not breathe. A giant hand
  was crushing his chest. He felt as though he was falling, and clutched
  desperately at Dancer’s reins.</p>
  
  <p>His terror must have shown on his face. “Bran?” Cley Cerwyn said. “Are
  you unwell? It’s only another king.” . . . . . [Quote skipped]</p>
  
  <p>The pain was an axe splitting his head apart, but when the crow
  wrenched out its beak all slimy with bits of bone and brain, Bran
  could see again. What he saw made him gasp in fear. <strong>He was clinging
  to a tower miles high</strong>, and his fingers were slipping, nails
  scrabbling at the stone, his legs dragging him down, stupid useless
  dead legs. <strong>“Help me!”</strong> he cried. <strong>A golden man appeared in the sky
  above him and pulled him up. “The things I do for love,” he murmured
  softly as he tossed him out kicking into empty air.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later he thinks the following when the Reeds ask him what he is afraid of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The falling, Bran thought, and <strong>the golden man</strong>, <strong>the queen's brother</strong>,
  he scares me too, but mostly the falling. He did not say it, though.
  How could he? He had not been able to tell Ser Rodrik or Maester
  Luwin, and he could not tell the Reeds either. If he didn't talk about
  it, maybe he would forget. He had never wanted to remember. It might
  not even be a true remembering.""</p>

  <p> Daenerys burns all the Dothraki Khals and then comes out of the burning house. Then all the Dothraki that came to see what was happening knelt before her, considering her the new leader of the horde because she 'defeated' the other Khals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Why would she be considered a Khaleesi and not a witch? Why did the Dothraki decide to follow her?</strong> It's seems like witches are a bad thing in Westeros, Essos and especially in the Dothraki culture. In the eye of a Dothraki man, I feel like she should be seen as a witch for surviving/creating the fire.
Also, there are probably a lot of Dothraki/Khalasars that probably don't want to be ruled by some foreign girl.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT :</strong> I think the Dothraki in the show does not believe she is a witch because I think Dothraki would not follow a witch. Witches seem to be a very bad thing in the eyes of this culture (see how the Dothraki girls in S06E03 were saying that Daenerys was a witch and that they should kill her, and after the event of the season 1 also). </p>

<p>So, if you think that the Dothraki might think that she's a witch but decide to follow her nonetheless, <strong>why would they agree to follow a witch even though witches are known to be a bad thing in this culture?</strong> </p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","132899","<p><strong>The Dothraki have no other option.</strong> Daenerys has just created a power vacuum where she is the only one to fill the void. </p>

<p>Now, all the other Khals are gone. Daenrys emerges as the one who defeated them. The Dothraki will only follow a winner, a disgraced Khal is no Khal at all. </p>

<p>However, Jeor Mormont's home on Bear Island is (I think) a little closer to Castle Black than Winterfell is. Yet he seemingly never visited. From what I can tell, he was quite close with his sister, Maege and surely would have expressed some desire to meet her daughters, his nieces. It is possible that he visited Bear Island when Jorah was exiled and that is how he obtained Longclaw but still, if Officers were allowed to come and go I'm sure Jeor would have visited his sister and nieces.</p>

Jeor abdicated Bear Island and went to The Wall so that Jorah could inherit. I'd have to think it'd be difficult visiting a home that your son lost, even if it was just lost to your sister. Jeor doesn't have a legitimate heir with Jorah in disgrace and so his descendants will not inherit Bear Island.</p>

<p>How and why do they call her the Night Queen? Is it due to the reason that the Night King and the White Walkers are seemingly always together? Or is the Night Queen also capable of ruling and commanding their undead troops.
How was she coined as the Queen of White Walkers?</p>

<p>Also, is there any mentioned part in the books or show that revealed the true identity of the Night Queen - when she was still alive, breathing and not a mundane creature?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","198591","<h2>A Song of Ice and Fire</h2>
<p>The Thirteenth Lord Commander of the Night's Watch proclaimed her his queen after he named himself king. So, while &quot;Night's Queen&quot; is never a title explicitly given it can be easily inferred that the queen of the &quot;Night's King&quot; would be called that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The gathering gloom put Bran in mind of another of Old Nan's stories, the tale of Night's King. He had been the thirteenth man to lead the Night's Watch, she said; a warrior who knew no fear. &quot;And that was the fault in him,&quot; she would add, &quot;for all men must know fear.&quot; A woman was his downfall; <strong>a woman glimpsed from atop the Wall, with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars. Fearing nothing, he chased her and caught her and loved her, though her skin was cold as ice, and when he gave his seed to her he gave his soul as well.</strong></p>
<p><strong>He brought her back to the Nightfort and proclaimed her a queen and himself her king, and with strange sorceries he bound his Sworn Brothers to his will.</strong> For thirteen years they had ruled, Night's King and his corpse queen, till finally the Stark of Winterfell and Joramun of the wildlings had joined to free the Watch from bondage. After his fall, when it was found he had been sacrificing to the Others, all records of Night's King had been destroyed, his very name forbidden.</p>

<p>So to recap the story that Bran knows from Old Nan...</p>
<ul>
<li>Thirteenth Lord Commander of the Night's Watch fell in love with a woman with &quot;skin as cold as ice and blue eyes&quot;.</li>
<li>Brought her back to the Wall where he proclaimed them king and queen.</li>
<li>Used magic to control the other Brothers until their defeat.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Maesters have heard and recorded the same story, although they offer some more insight on how the legend may have began.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The oldest of these tales concern the legendary Night's King, the thirteenth Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, who was alleged to have bedded a sorceress pale as a corpse and declared himself a king. For thirteen years the Night's King and his &quot;corpse queen&quot; ruled together, before King of Winter, Brandon the Breaker, (in alliance, it is said, with the King-Beyond-the-Wall, Joramun) brought them down. Thereafter, he obliterated the Night's King's very name from memory.</p>
<p>In the Citadel, the archmaesters largely dismiss these tales—though some allow that there <strong>may have been a Lord Commander who attempted to carve out a kingdom for himself</strong> in the earliest days of the Watch. Some suggest that perhaps <strong>the corpse queen was a woman of the Barrowlands</strong>, a daughter of the Barrow King who was then a power in his own right, and oft associated with graves.</p>

"133152","Why would Tywin allow Jaime Lannister to fight in dangerous battles","<h2>Why would Tywin risk losing his most important son in battles that could have killed Jaime Lanister at a young age?</h2>

<p>While researching this question, I came across this question and answer.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/123550/why-did-tywin-lannister-allow-jaime-to-join-the-kingsguard"">Why did Tywin Lannister allow Jaime to join the Kingsguard?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There is an excerpt in one of the answers from <em>The World of Ice and Fire: The Untold History of Westeros, p121</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ser Jaime was also Lord Tywin's heir, however, and carried all his
  hopes for the perpetuation of House Lannister, as his lordship's other
  son was a the malformed dwarf, Tyrion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although it states why Tywin had to allow Jaime into the Kings Guard, it does not state why he would risk his son's life in battle.</p>

<p>At the age of fifteen, Jaime fought in the battle against the Kingswood Brotherhood, after which Jaime was knighted on the battlefield by Ser Arthur Dayne.</p>

<p>It just goes against all logical thinking to allow a green, young boy to fight in a dangerous battle when he is so important to probably <strong>the</strong> most prestigious family in Westeros. </p>

<p>Or is there some significance in being in a battle, like having to fight in one before you can be given knighthood? Or is there another reason as to why Tywin would allow this?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","133154","<p>The answer is in Chapter 44 of AFFC, not the show sadly.</p>

<h2>Tywin's Wishes</h2>

<p>Jaime saw his mother in a vision and this is what she said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tywin dreamed that his son would be a great knight</strong>, that his daughter would be a queen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was Tywin's heart's desire that Jaime become a great Knight. No one ever became a great knight without fighting in battles. </p>

<h2>Jaime's skills</h2>

<p>Jaime showed very high aptitude in martial arts since his childhood and thus his father never worried about his skills in defending himself. He however provided him with masters at arms and armours which would probably be very expensive and of high quality. We do know of Jaime's golden armor which people think is gold but is actually gilded steel. </p>

<h2>Highborn Customs for Upbringing of Children</h2>

<p>All highborn lads are supposed to be squires and win their spurs of knighthood.</p>

<p>According to AWOIAF wiki:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a boy reaches adolescence, he graduates to being a squire.
  Squires learn how to properly care for and use weapons, armor, and
  horses as well as learning about chivalry. In time of war Squires join
  their masters in war, assisting them with their equipment and fighting
  by their side in battles.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Is Battle Veterancy required for Knighthood?</h2>

<p>Not really. If you are following the usual path (page->squire->knight) It depends on the Knight squiring you to determine when you are ready get your spurs aka Knighthood. </p>

<p>Other than that you can either buy your knighthood e.g. Ser Glendon Flowers or you can win it by performing a great deed of a non-military nature e.g. Ser Davos Seaworth winning it by supplying the Starving garrison of Storm's End with food. You can also be knighted for valor in Battle even if you were never a squire e.g. Ser Jorah Mormont winning his knighthood in Siege of Pyke. To learn more about the knighthood paths, see <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/60345/who-can-knight-you-so-that-the-knighting-would-stick/131327#131327"">my previous answer here</a>. </p>

<h2>Is it wise to let a green young boy in War?</h2>

<p>By Westerosi and medieval standards, Jaime was 15 which is almost <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Customs#Age_of_majority"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the age of a grown man</a>. Jaime was green but how do you propose he would have gained experience if not by fighting? Every warrior is green at some point and through battle he gains experience. </p>

<p>Tywin's own father was a weak man of non-martial nature which is why Tywin wanted his heir to be a puissant warrior, so that he could secure Tywin's legacy even after Tywin was dead. That's where we see Kingswood Campaign, a small campaign against a glorified band of bandits. Can't see really a lot of dangers when Royal Army marches against outlaws. </p>

<h2>The Kingswood Campaign</h2>

<p>Jaime followed the regular route and became squire and ward of Lord <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Sumner_Crakehall"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sumner Crakehall</a> as per Westerosi customs. Squires attend to their masters in battle so Jaime did as well in Fight against the Kingswood brothehood. Jaime was not supposed to do what he did but as fate would have it, Lord Crakehall was injured and Jaime took it upon himself to protect his ""father figure"". </p>

<p>That's when people realized the true potential of this young squire as he held his own against the infamous <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Big_Belly_Ben"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Big Belly Benn</a> and <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Smiling_Knight"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Smiling Knight</a>. His performance was so impressive that a legendary Knight of Kingsguard, Ser Arthur Dayne promptly knighted Jaime at end of the campaign. Jaime won his knighthood in that campaign by none other than Ser Arthur Dayne.</p>

<p>Besides you are over-estimating the danger of the campaign. Kingswood brotherhood were essentially a band of outlaws. They were not a dangerous Army, they relied on guerrilla tactics and support among the masses to hide after their raids. It was a perfect testing ground for a young squire aspiring to be a Knight. Besides, Jaime would have an Army around him. </p>

<h2>Outlaws, Ransoms &amp; Nobles</h2>

<p>Kingswood Brotherhood was notorious for kidnapping nobles and demanding ransom. Nobles and Knights are usually held captives for ransom if they are bested in battle. Even if Jaime was defeated, he would have been taken captive as Heir to Casterly Rock was worth a lot of ransom. </p>

<h2>Tywin's mindset</h2>

<p>Tywin always thinks more about his ideals and wishes about his family than his actual family. He was more concerned with making his son a great Knight. Such ambitions don't always pay off, Mace Tyrell wanted the same for his son and heir Willas but poor Willas was paralyzed after losing a jousting event against Prince Oberyn Martell. (In show there is no Willas Tyrell).</p>

<p>Jaime did not take any more risks than any other noble highborn lad serving some Knight as a squire. Those dangers are part of being a Knight and a Lord. Which is essentially what those young boys are being trained for. Seeing the mess weak Tytos Lannister had created, Tywin was determined to make his heir strong and capable.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Tywin wanted his son to be a great knight and thus did whatever was necessary to hone his martial skills. </p>

"133204","Why did Eddard Stark keep Catelyn in the dark?","<p>In the Season 6 finale of Game of Thrones, we learn that</p>

<p>(Okay, to be fair, we don't 100% definitely know this, but it is incredibly heavily implied.  So for the purposes of this question, I assume it to be true.)</p>

<p>If that is the case, then why did Ned lie to his wife?  Why did</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Ned tell Catelyn that he had been unfaithful to her during the campaign, and that this child he brought back was the result of his infidelity?</p>

<p>While I understand that Ned was made to promise to </p>

</blockquote>

<p>what was to be gained from keeping that secret from his wife as well?</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> It seems that lying to his wife about the baby's parentage did nothing to protect Jon - and in fact, made Catelyn less likely to want to protect him - not to mention the damage it caused in their marriage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given all that it likely cost, why would Ned have lied about this to his wife?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","133207","<p><strong>Because Eddard did not trust Catelyn enough at the time to tell her about a secret that could lead to murder of Jon and destruction of House Stark. Later the topic just never came up and both of them decided not to bring it up and enjoy a loving marital life. Nothing was to be gained except guaranteed security of Jon. Just a precautionary thing.</strong> </p>

<p>To understand this, you must first understand how Eddard Stark and Catelyn Tully got married. Since show did not cover those events, we need to rely on books instead.</p>

<h2>Catelyn's betrothal to Brandon &amp; Eddard's interest in Ashara Dayne</h2>

<p>Catelyn Tully was initially betrothed to Eddard's elder brother Brandon who was heir to Winterfell (ADWD, Chapter 41, ACOK Chapter 45). Eddard himself was infatuated with Lady Ashara Dayne, sister of the legendary Ser Arthur Dayne (ASOS, Chapter 34). Ashara was considered a great beauty of her time. A very splendid depiction by Elena Maria Vacas can be seen on her page, <a href=""https://www.artstation.com/artwork/9B4ZQ"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Brandon's Death and Robert's Rebellion</h2>

<p>Fast forward, Rhaegar and Lyanna run away together when the Starks were on their way to Riverrun for wedding of Brandon and Catelyn. Brandon, hot headed and impulsive, was under the impression that Rhaegar abducted Lyanna. He rode to King's Landing with close friends and screamed for Prince Rhaegar to ""<strong><em>Come out and die</em></strong>"". Prince Rhaegar was not there, but mad King Aerys was. He imprisoned Brandon and summoned his father Lord Rickard Stark to King's Landing. Then he had both of them executed. Then he asked Lord Arryn to send him heads of his wards the young Lords Robert Baratheon and Eddard Stark. Jon Arryn instead called his banners because he loved those boys like his own sons and Robert's rebellion started. (AGOT Chapter 4, ACOK Chapter 55, AGOT chapter 2)</p>

<h2>Eddard marries Catelyn</h2>

<p>Always dutiful and responsible, Eddard set aside his own wishes for marriage and married a total stranger Catelyn Tully in place of his brother, to secure swords of House Tully for Robert's cause (AGOT, Chapter 6). He did not know her, he did not love her and he did not trust her. He did not even like her at the time, it was Ashara whom he liked. </p>

<p>He could not have married Ashara instead because:</p>

<ol>
<li>House Dayne was a minor House with less power as compared to House Tully. Rebels faced combined might of The Reach, Dorne and Crownlands. There was no telling which side Lannisters would go but seeing as Tywin was a childhood friend of Aerys II, He may have joined on side of Aerys too. So They sorely needed swords of the Lord Paramount of Riverlands to wage the war. Daynes used to be kings once, but those days were far gone.  </li>
<li>House Dayne was vassal of House Martell, who had already declared for King Aerys due to marriage between Princess Elia of Dorne and Prince Rhaegar Targaryen. Thus they were honor bound to follow their liege lord Prince Doran in the war, making them unable to help the rebels.</li>
<li>Help from House Dayne would have been very little, if any. Had they joined forces with Rebels, they would be trapped between the loyalist forces of Tyrells and Martells who would at once move to fight the Daynes. That itself would put Ashara and her kin in great danger. Lord Dayne would have to be an utter idiot to agree to such an alliance.</li>
</ol>

<p>After wedding and bedding Catelyn, Eddard went to war.</p>

<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_the_Bells"" rel=""noreferrer"">Battle of Bells</a> happened where combined Forces of Eddard and his father in law saved the trapped Robert Baratheon. </p>

<p>Prince Rhaegar returned from South and died at <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_the_Trident"" rel=""noreferrer"">Trident</a>. </p>

<p>Since Robert was wounded in the battle, Eddard lead a quick charge towards King's Landing, only to find it had been <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Sack_of_King%27s_Landing"" rel=""noreferrer"">conquered for Robert by the Lannisters</a>. Eddard and Robert had a quarrel regarding the murders of Rhaegar's children but Robert only called them Dragonspawn. A fuming Eddard lead his men further south to fight rest of battles alone. He ended <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Siege_of_Storm%27s_End"" rel=""noreferrer"">Siege of Storm's End</a> first and then moved further south to Dorne where entire episode of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Raid_on_the_Tower_of_Joy"" rel=""noreferrer"">Tower of Joy</a> happened. </p>

<h2>Eddard's return from ToJ</h2>

<p>When Eddard got back with Jon, he knew he could not trust anyone especially after he saw Robert's reaction to murder of Rhaegar's children(AGOT, Chapter 12). He knew Robert would kill Jon as well if he so much got a whiff of who he was. So he decided to keep it a secret. His friend Lord Howland Reed did the same.</p>

<p>When Eddard got home, his lady wife arrived soon after, the woman he barely knew and thus did not trust enough to divulge such an important secret which would mean death of his sister's only son if the wrong people learned of it. Therefore, Eddard told her before returning to Winterfell that the babe was his bastard child. A lot of men fathered bastard children and such matters are private so no one was likely to pry into it especially when it's bastard of a man like Eddard who was known to be very private, shy and quiet.</p>

<h2>Danger of being spied on</h2>

<p>With time, Eddard came to love and trust Catelyn but he never divulged that info to her. He probably thought it best to let it be instead of bringing it up again. You never know who is listening in the castles especially with Varys in service of Robert. We know it was wise because Varys had spies in Winterfell and he learnt about the assassination attempt on Bran by Joff's catspaw despite Catelyn trying to keep it a secret. </p>

<h2>Catelyn's attempts to learn the truth</h2>

<p>Catelyn tried to get the information but Eddard was adamant. There were rumors that Ashara Dayne was the mother of the child so Catelyn decided to confront Eddard. Eddard got very stern with her and told her ""<strong><em>Jon is my blood, that's all you need to know</em></strong>"". Catelyn got scared of Ned for first and last time in their married life. After that Catelyn never brought up the topic again and Eddard did not either. (AGOT chapter 6)</p>

<h2>Ashara Dayne Factor</h2>

<p>It is also worth noting that after killing Arthur Dayne at Tower of Joy, Eddard went to Castle of Starfall first, seat of house Dayne. There he gave the ancestral Sword of House Dayne, named Dawn and carried by Ser Arthur Dayne at ToJ, to his(Eddard's, not Arthur's) apparent lover Ashara Dayne and gave her the news of her Brother's death. Mad with grief for her brother (and allegedly losing a child) and the fact that It was Eddard who killed Arthur, Ashara jumped from a tower into the sea and died. So it would make sense that Ned would do anything to avoid mention of Ashara Dayne as it brought back memories that he did not wish to recall ever again. </p>

<p>Ashara was a known alleged lover of Eddard<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> who was also pregnant and gave birth to a child<sup><strong>2</strong></sup> before her death, rumors started that Ashara Dayne was mother of Jon and she killed herself when Eddard took Jon away from her. Eddard did not deny or confirm these rumors but moved to quell them, especially in his own household. Eddard's weird reaction made many people believe that Ashara was Jon's mother. Apparently Eddard thought it best to give people the impression that Ashara must have been the mother. </p>

<p>Ashara's nephew Lord Edric Dayne met Arya and confirmed that Ashara was not the mother of Jon but he also confirmed that She and Eddard loved each other. (ASOS Chapter 39). Exact quote added because I loved that conversation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“My father was Ser Arthur’s elder brother. Lady Ashara was my aunt. I
  never knew her, though. She threw herself into the sea from atop the
  Palestone Sword before I was born.”</p>
  
  <p>“Why would she do that?” said Arya, startled.</p>
  
  <p>Ned looked wary. Maybe he was afraid that she was going to throw
  something at him. “Your lord father never spoke of her?” he said. “The
  Lady Ashara Dayne, of Starfall?”</p>
  
  <p>“No. Did he know her?”</p>
  
  <p>“Before Robert was king. She met your father and his brothers at
  Harrenhal, during the year of the false spring.”</p>
  
  <p>“Oh.” Arya did not know what else to say. “Why did she jump in the
  sea, though?”</p>
  
  <p>“Her heart was broken.”</p>
  
  <p>Sansa would have sighed and shed a tear for true love, but Arya just
  thought it was stupid. She couldn’t say that to Ned, though, not about
  his own aunt. “Did someone break it?”</p>
  
  <p>He hesitated. “Perhaps it’s not my place...”</p>
  
  <p>“Tell me.”</p>
  
  <p>He looked at her uncomfortably. “My aunt Allyria says <strong>Lady Ashara
  and your father fell in love at Harrenhal</strong> -”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Catelyn's resentment</h2>

<p>Catelyn was not a bad woman but it is too much to ask of a woman to endure a walking, talking reminder of her husband's infidelity, especially if you know that it wasn't a mere one night fling, the other woman was loved very much by your husband. She knew about Ashara Dayne, even though not for certainty,  whom she saw as a ghost who was her rival for Eddard's love. She hated that Ashara's alleged son looked more Stark than her own Son Robb who looked like a Tully. She hated that Eddard loved Jon's mother so much that he would not abandon her son despite Cat's constant pleadings. </p>

<p>Thus she treated Jon with contempt and hatred as any medieval step mother would. As suggested by <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/20490/gowenfawr"">Gowenfawr</a>, if Ned had told Catelyn, she would have been kind to Jon and everyone would have wondered what was actually at play there even if Varys did not manage to report the conversation in the first place.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Eddard took his vows very seriously and he promised his sister to keep Jon safe. He endured Jeering, mocking and confrontations with his wife but he never put Jon's security at risk by telling his true identity to anyone. Some things are better left buried. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I was doing a re-read of AGOT today and found something which I had never thought of much importance until now. In AGOT Chapter 33 Eddard VIII, Eddard thinks this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lord Stannis shared the secret Jon Arryn had died for, he was certain
  of it. The truth he sought might very well be waiting for him on the
  ancient island fortress of House Targaryen. <strong><em>And when you have it,
  what then? Some secrets are safer kept hidden. Some secrets are too
  dangerous to share, even with those you love and trust.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It appears this is hinting towards why Eddard kept Catelyn in dark about Jon's parentage even after he came to love and trust her. This is why I love ASOIAF, on every re-read, you discover something new. </p>

<hr>

<p><sub><strong>1</strong></sub> <sub>There is an alternate theory propelled by Barristan Selmy's memoirs of Harrenhal that it is possible that It was Brandon Stark, elder brother of Eddard, who ""dishonored"" Ashara Dayne and had the Harrenhal fling with her. It is, in any case, unproven as of now because Selmy uses the word <em>Stark</em> instead of recalling Ashara's lover by his name. Brandon Stark was however that sort of person, a playboy aristocrat. He had an alleged affair with Barbary Dustin as well despite his betrothal so it won't be beyond him to trick Ashara into sleeping with him by lying to her about his intents/feelings and then abandoning her. It is very uncharacteristic of Eddard Stark to ""dishonor"" a woman and then abandon her. As Robb does most things like Eddard Stark would do, we know he chose to risk his Kingdom and crown instead of ""dishonoring"" Jeyne Westerling, it may be an indication but as stated already, this is a theory. Canon sources still suggest that It was Eddard, not Brandon.</sub> </p>

<p><sub><strong>2.</strong> According to Barristan Selmy, Ashara's Child was a daughter who was dead at birth</sub></p>

"133309","Do marriages still apply across faiths in Westeros?","<p>Reading <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/133278/would-this-character-still-be-a-bastard"">this question</a> about Jon's bastard status, it occurred to me that people in the south get married in a sept, whereas people in the north generally get married before a Weirwood tree.</p>

<p>This raised the question about whether people following different religions, and having different marriage ceremonies, still believe they are married in the eyes of foreign gods?</p>

<p>Further to this, there are other religions outside of Westeros, such as the Dothraki horse religion, and the religion of Rh'llor, with their own wedding customs and religious beliefs. When Daenerys married Khal Drogo, King Robert felt it was serious enough to pose a threat if they had a child, therefore people of different religions recognized the <em>validity</em> of marriages in other religions, and hence any of their offspring would have been trueborn.</p>

<p>But is there any precedence for someone being married, changing religion, and getting remarried as they felt their marriage was no longer legitimate within their new faith?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","133432","<p>Planetos in general is a multi-faith and multi-cultural one, just like the real world. However, In Westeros at least, It is normal for people of different faith to marry and their offspring are considered true born because Westeros has a lot of cultures and religions in one state (After Braavos maybe). I suppose it must be even more common in Essos seeing how many religions and cultures exist there even inside one city state e.g. Braavos.</p>

<p>Following are some Examples of Cross-faith marriages in Westeros:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Queen <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lelia_Lannister"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lelia Lannister</a> and King <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Harmund_II_Hoare"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Harmund II Hoare</a></strong>: Princess Lelia Of the Rock married ward of her father, then Crown-prince of Iron Islands Prince Harmund Hoare. Harmund succeeded to Iron Throne eventually as Harmund II. Their offspring was considered true born even though they were brought up in Faith of the Seven instead of faith of the Drowned God. Her Son, Also named Harmund, Took the Throne of Iron Isles as <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Harmund_III_Hoare"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Harmund III Hoare</a> on his father's death.</li>
<li><p><strong>Lord <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Eddard_Stark"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Eddard Stark</a> and Lady <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Catelyn_Stark"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Catelyn Tully</a></strong>: Catelyn Tully was brought up in light of the Seven while Eddard worshipped the Old Gods. Eddard and Catelyn were married according to traditions of the faith of Seven in Sept of Riverrun.</p>

<p>From AGOT Chapter 6:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Catelyn pulled the furs to her chin and watched him.He looked somehow
  smaller and more vulnerable, <strong>like the youth she had wed in the sept
  at Riverrun</strong>, fifteen long years gone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Their children were trueborn.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prince <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Doran_Martell"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Doran Martell</a> and Lady <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Mellario"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mellario of Norvos</a></strong>: Not much info is available on their marriage but we know Mellario was Norvoshi and thus most likely followed the religion of bearded priests. They were however married in Dorne so it is probable that they must have been married in Faith of Seven's ways. They had three children, all of whom were trueborn in eyes of whole realm. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>This concludes our few examples to establish the fact of legitimacy of children born to parents of different faith. </p>

<p>Now as to did someone ever change religion and felt the need to remarry, <strong>I am afraid there is no such precedence</strong>. Only people that we do know who changed religion (Other than the Brotherhood without Banners) are <strong>Selyse Florent</strong> (Devout) and <strong>Stannis Baratheon</strong> (Just did it for magical powers). <strong>They did not remarry in light of R'hllor</strong>. (<s>Though I don't know why do I keep getting the feeling that Selyse expressed that wish? I can't find any reference to prove her expression of such wish.</s> She did in ADWD when discussing Alys Karstark's wedding to Magnar of Thenn.)</p>

<p>People of Westeros appear to believe all the marriages as legally binding, no matter in which god's name were they performed. We have seen Weddings between followers of different faiths, performed in the way of the Seven (Eddard and Catelyn), Weddings performed in the light of Rhllor (Alys Karstark and Magnar of Thenn), Weddings performed in the old ways (Lady Hornwood and Ramsay Bolton - Hornwood was born a Manderly who follow the Seven) and all were considered legal. In Essos however, we know that at least the Ghiscari insist that weddings must be performed in ways of the gods of Ghis like how Daenerys was informed that she must wed Hizdhar zo Loraq according to Ghiscari rites or she'll be considered his concubine not legal wife, their children shall be bastards.</p>

"133313","Is Lyanna Mormont the Lady of Bear Island on the show? (in contrast with the books)","<p>In the books Lyanna's mother <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Maege_Mormont"">Maege</a> is Lady of House Mormont. Lyanna also has other siblings that go in line before her. She does seem to have some authority because she was the one to respond to Stannis's letter but I think that was simply because all her siblings and her mother were not at Bear Island at the moment according to the wiki page of Maege:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lady Maege is mentioned by her oldest surviving daughter, Alysane, when asked about her siblings by Asha Greyjoy. She is with two of her other daughters, Lyra and Jory, though it is not said where, while her youngest, Lyanna is back on Bear Island.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the show it does seem that Lyanna is in charge of everything or is that also simply because the rest is not at home?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","133316","<h2>Books</h2>

<p>Maege Mormont has following daughters:</p>

<ol>
<li>Dacey Mormont</li>
<li>Alysane Mormont</li>
<li>Lyra Mormont</li>
<li>Jorelle Mormont</li>
<li>Lyanna Mormont</li>
</ol>

<p>Dacey was murdered at Red Wedding. Alysane apparently came back to Bear Islands because she was part of Stannis's liberation of Deepwood Motte. Lyra Mormont was last with her Lady Mother who went on Robb's orders to find Lord Reed, they have disappeared. Jorelle is also with them. </p>

<p>Which leaves Lyanna the Mormont in Bear Island as Alysane is on the march with Stannis. She was on Bear Island because she was not with her Mother in Riverlands, and because she replied to Stannis' summons in ADWD:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is
  STARK.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But since she is the youngest daughter and second daughter of Lady Maege is alive and free, it appears she is filling the place of Alysane in books, rather than being in charge in her own right. </p>

<p>You must keep it in mind that when Lyanna replied Stannis, it was before He moved against Ironborn. Only explanation for that can be that Alysane must be away. </p>

<p>Afterwards when Stannis moved against the Ironborn, It was Alysane who lead the surprise Mormont attack on Ironborn and later swore fealty to Stannis on behalf of her house.</p>

<p>In any case, Alysane is the heir, not Lyanna.</p>

<h2>Show</h2>

<p>In the show, No other Children of Lady Maege Mormont are mentioned and Lyanna is mentioned as Lady of Bear Island. So it appears, in show canon, Lyanna is the only Child of Lady Maege and thus inherited the Island on her Mother's demise. </p>

<p>Maege's death is not shown on the Show but it is implied because in Season 5, Stannis refers to Lyanna as Lady of Bear Island. </p>

<p>As pointed out by <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/31029/bcdotweb"">BCdotWEB</a>, Lyanna said this in Episode ""Broken Man"" to confirm her mother's death:</p>

"133361","Real-World Language Analogues in the World of Ice and Fire","<p>George RR Martin is, by his own admission, <a href=""http://www.welovethisbook.com/features/creating-game-thrones-valyrian-language"" rel=""noreferrer"">not a linguist</a>, and as such he has not done a great deal of linguistic heavy lifting in his storyverse. I believe this shows through in the narrative's use of language; while it can be argued that the Common Tongue of Westeros is <em>not</em> an analogue to English (the English books then being a translation of that Common Tongue), it's my general sense from many of the place names and common idioms in use (especially in the north) that the language of the characters in Westeros really is analogous to a pre-modern form of English, say a century or so after Shakespeare.</p>

<p>I'm wondering, though, if there is any firmer evidence that there are other language analogues in Westeros or Essos. For example, it's probably uncontroversial to posit that Valyrian holds a similar position in Essosi society that Latin holds in European society, being the language of a foundational empire and a progenator of several contemporary Essosi tongues and dialects, but that does not make Valyrian analogous <em>as a language</em> to Latin. To be analogous in the sense that I mean, a speaker of a real-world language should be able to hold a basic conversation with a speaker of a Westerosi or Essosi language.</p>

<p>Is there any evidence that Dornish, say, is analogous to Spanish, or that the tongue of the Children of the Forest is analogous to Gaelic?</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Note: this question primarily concerns the books, but I would not be opposed to show-canon answers or comments.</em></p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><languages>","135550","<p><strong>Short Answer</strong></p>

<p>There is no in-world evidence that any non-common tongue language is analogous to any real-world language. There is canon evidence to the contrary for the Dothraki and Valyrian languages. There is evidence from the author that, <em>currently</em>, apart from the common tongue, no languages in <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> are or are not considered to be analogous to any real-world language, as he just hasn't thought about it (although he does seem to like what David J. Peterson has done with Dothraki and Valyrian).</p>

<p><strong>Long Answer</strong></p>

<p>First of all, these pages list (as far as I'm aware) all of the times that other (non-common tongue) languages appear in the books:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""http://wiki.dothraki.org/Original_Corpus"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dothraki (Corpus)</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://wiki.dothraki.org/High_Valyrian_Corpus"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">High Valyrian(Corpus)</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://wiki.dothraki.org/Other_languages"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Other languages</a>: The Common Tongue, The Old Tongue, High Valyrian, Low Valyrian (Tyroshi, Braavosi and Slaver Cities), Ghiscari, Qartheen, The Language of Asshai, Lhazareen, The Summer Tongue, The Trade Tongue, Other Languages (Jogos Nhai, Bayasabhad, Shamyriana, Kayakayanaya, Ibbenese, etc.), The Children of the Forest's language, The Others' Language, Necromancy and communication between animals such as Direwolves.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now, David J. Peterson created the languages in the TV show, but to do this he had to start with the languages in the books. Apart from the above words in the books he took inspiration for Dothraki from <a href=""http://dothraki.conlang.org/official-hbo-press-release/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Russian, Turkish, Estonian, Inuktitut and Swahili</a>. He has also said <a href=""http://www.tor.com/2010/04/22/creating-dothraki-an-interview-with-david-j-peterson-and-sai-emrys/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""To an untrained ear, it might sound like Arabic. To someone who knows Arabic, it doesn’t. I tend to think of the sound as a mix between Arabic (minus the distinctive pharyngeals) and Spanish, due to the dental consonants.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, Dothraki is unlike any individual real-world language. Especially considering that there are so few words in the books.</p>

<p>As for Valyrian, there's High Valyrian, which plays the equivalent role to Latin. There's also Low Valyrian, which is what's actually spoken and are actually a series of related languages, equivalent to the Romance languages. Again, none of the Valyrian languages would be analogous to a real-world language (dead or otherwise).</p>

<p>In terms of out of world comments from GRRM, from <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1250/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The best I could do was try to sketch in each of the chief tongues of my imaginary world in broad strokes, and give them each their characteristic sounds and spellings.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Suggesting that he might have an idea of what the languages sound like, although he's not saying that any of his languages are or are not analogous to any real-world languages, he seems to be saying that he's thinking of them in terms of what they sound like. This does suggest that, as he cannot actually speak any languages other than English.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2010/04/12/klaatu-barada-nicto/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>, GRRM just made up the words that he needed in the book and this further suggests that (considering how important Valyrian is) he hasn't really thought about any of the languages apart from the basic sound and spelling. Or,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Uh... well... all I know about High Valyrian is the seven words I've made up to date. When I need an eighth, I'll make that up too... but I don't have a whole imaginary language in my desk here, the way Tolkien did."" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which suggests that whether or not any of the created languages are analogous to any real-world languages just hasn't been thought of.</p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","133490","<p>It is simply unknown as of now. </p>

<p>Others are a mysterical species who are most certainly not dead. One key aspect of life is <em>growing up</em>. Quoting GRRM:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Others are not dead. They are strange, beautiful… think, oh… the
  Sidhe made of ice, something like that… a different sort of life…
  inhuman, elegant, dangerous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Following is the compilation of available info and inferences drawn on that info from both Canons:</p>

<h2>Books</h2>

<p>In Books, there is no explicit indication of what exactly do Others do to the offered children. But it is heavily implied that they make them one of them which in turn implies that somehow the Others are either incapable of reproducing or they can't reproduce fast enough to build their army for the upcoming war. </p>

<p>It has been 8000 years since Others were defeated. The information about them is virtually none. Even the Night's Watch has lost its knowledge about their kind. So as of now, we do not know what exactly is the process involved in making one  A white Walker. </p>

<p>We know Craster offers his sons to the Others. From Jon III ACOK:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If it’s a girl, that’s not so bad, she’ll grown in a few years and
  he’d marry her. But Nella says its to be a boy, and she’s had six and
  knows these things. <strong>He gives the boys to the gods</strong>. Come the white
  cold, he does and of late it comes more often.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since many of Craster's daughters did grow up in his life time and he did marry them, it is implied that many of his sons must have grown up as well, albeit as the Others, not as humans. </p>

<p>One of Craster's wives confirmed this to Sam after <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Mutiny_at_Craster%27s_Keep"" rel=""noreferrer"">mutiny at Craster's keep</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The boy’s bothers… Craster’s sons. The white cold's rising out there,
  crow. I can feel it in my bones. These poor old bones don’t lie.
  <strong>They’ll be here soon, the sons</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If she says they will be here soon, that means they must have grown up. It is implied because well, toddlers can't walk or travel by themselves. If the boy's brothers are coming, they must have grown up into adults. After all, in all the encounters with Others, we haven't seen a single instance of an infant Other coming to stick his icy blade in someone's heart. </p>

<p>The event depicted in the Show in this regard never happened in the Books.</p>

<h2>Show</h2>

<p>In show it is explicitly described that the Others turn the babies into their kind, as evident from the video linked in your own post. </p>

<p>As for the process involved, only thing that we see is that the Night's king just has touch a Child and convert him into a White Walker. But I don't believe only touch is required because Night's King also touched Bran but he did not turn into a White Walker. </p>

<p>So it appears, only infants can be converted into White Walkers, Adults have to be killed and reanimated as Wights, thralls to the Others.</p>

<p>It is not known if all White Walkers can convert an infant into one of them or only Night's King can do that. It is likely that only Night's King can do that because rest of the Others simply put the child down there to await his Majesty's pleasure. None of them made any attempt to convert the child and waited for their leader. </p>

<p>About Growth of Others, we do not know anything. But since they converted Infants, it is probable that the converted boys grow up into youth of the Others. </p>

<p>Another point to note is that their growth and aging process appears to be different than humans. Night's King was supposedly created during First Men-Children of the Forest wars which happened 12,000 years ago. He seems pretty fit for a 12,000+ years old guy.</p>

"133500","Which female line was Olenna Tyrell talking about?","<p>In ASOS Chapter 6, Olenna Tyrell says this to Sansa Stark:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You Starks were kings once, the Arryns and the Lannisters as well, and
  <strong>even the Baratheons through the female line</strong>, but the Tyrells were no more than stewards until Aegon the Dragon came along and cooked the

<p>Baratheons are descended from two Royal Dynasties through females:</p>

</ol>

<p>Which female line is she talking about here? The Targaryen female line or the Durrandon female line? Or is she talking about both?</p>

<p>Since Princess Argella was heir of her father and shortly ruled as Storm Queen before her defeat, I am more inclinded to believe Olenna is talking about Baratheons being heirs of House Durrandon through Argella, who ruled Stormlands for centuries in their own right before the Dragons came. The context also makes me think that way because she was talking about Royalties of Pre-conquest era.</p>

<p>My own speculative conclusion is that Benjen's case is probably different since he is not exactly a whight, and wights should be able to cross the door.

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","133800","<p>It makes sense for ""Visy"" the overbearing older brother to have a diminutive nickname for his little sister, who he's been a (not very good) father-like figure to while dragging her around Essos since she was a baby. </p>

<p>It doesn't make much sense for Dany who (at this point) was the frightened dependent younger sibling to have a diminutive nickname for the egotistical bully of an older brother she spent much of her life in fear of.</p>

<hr>

<p>We know that Viserys took himself <em>very</em> seriously, calling himself a king and a 'dragon' in the face of constant mockery, and that he tended to take his frustrations out on his little sister who he threatened and bullied. In the TV show, all we really see of Dany's early years are her looking lost, depressed, fearful and passive in the first episode, and him casually threatening her in other episodes. In the books, we understand that she'd spent much of her early childhood dependent on Viserys, looking up to him in a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome"" rel=""noreferrer"">Stockholm Syndrome</a> sort of way, and she didn't begin to question his version of who he was until later. </p>

<hr>

<p>The other nicknames Visy has (book only, if I remember right) are all mocking:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dubbed ""Beggar King"" by the Essos-based nobles he begs for support</li>
<li>Dubbed ""Cart King"" and ""Sorefoot King"" by the Dothraki who laugh at him tagging along behind his sister not understanding that walking or sitting on a cart instead of riding are considered shameful in their culture</li>
</ul>

<p>The few allies Visy had were people like Illyrio who massaged his ego in the hope of becoming the power behind the absolute ruler of a continent - they too would therefore not give him an irreverent, affectionate or childish nickname but would inflate his ego and encourage him to think of himself as a serious king.</p>

"133822","Why does Daenerys get a title on her birth?","<p>First of all, i would like to clarify that my question is not a duplicate of <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/33390/why-is-daenerys-called-stormborn"">this question</a>. I know where the title “Stormborn” comes from, but my question is why does she have it at all?</p>

<p>I don't recall (m)any other characters having a title that they received at birth.</p>

<p>I understand that people are given titles/nicknames that they earned or are given by others:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jaime Lannister: The Kingslayer, given to him for killing his own king</li>
<li>Robb Stark: The Young Wolf, given to him for being a young Stark who fights a war  </li>
<li>Jon Snow: King Crow, given to him by the wildlings for being the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch</li>
<li>Daenerys Targaryen: Mother of Dragons, self-proclaimed title for bringing 3 dragons into the world</li>
<li>Daenerys Targaryen: Breaker of chains, self-proclaimed title for freeing slaves in Slavers Bay</li>
</ul>

<p>Throughout the TV series we see many people with these types of titles:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Mountain</li>
<li>The Hound</li>
<li>Barristan the Bold</li>
<li>The Red Viper of Dorne</li>
<li>The Black Fish</li>
<li>Lord of Bones</li>
<li>Etc...</li>
</ul>

<p>We know that Daenerys has many titles and she loves telling people all of them, but <strong>why did she get a title at birth?</strong> No one else seems to run around with a title about the conditions that they were born in.</p>

<p>Also, the storm destroyed the Targaryen fleet.. Its not as if the storm brought victory for the Targaryens.</p>

<p>Is there any elaboration about this anywhere?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","133823","<h2>Why did Daenerys get her epithet?</h2>

<p>The Night Daenerys was born, a huge storm raged outside Dragonstone. It was so fierce that it smashed the Royal fleet anchored in the bay. Amidst this Storm, Queen Rhaella gave birth to her youngest child who was named Daenerys. That's why she got the epithet Stormborn.</p>

<h2>Did anyone else got such a nickname upon his/her birth?</h2>

<p>Yes. It's just like <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aemon_Steelsong"">Mance Rayder's son</a>, Aemon, called Battleborn, Steel Song and Blood-born because he was born during the decisive <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_Castle_Black"">Battle of Castle Black</a>. Some people are born in something important or significant and thus get names out of it. Mance's son Aemon was born in a battle and thus is called Battleborn, and Daenerys was born in a great storm and is therefore called Stormborn.</p>

<h2>How do you get nicknames?</h2>

<p>Nicknames don't have to be earned by others. You can get them from your own traits or simply because of your birth if something significant happened at birth. </p>

<p>Aemon (Son of Mance Rayder) and Daenerys got their names because of their birth.</p>

<p>Daemon Blackfyre chose his own name from his sword. </p>

<p>Ser Duncan the tall named himself the Tall because he was well, tall. </p>

<p>Of the examples you cited:</p>

<ol>
<li>Jaime got his epithet from his crime of killing King Aerys. Until then, he was the Young Lion, not Kingslayer.</li>
<li>Robb Stark got his epithet from his House's sigil, his youth and his pet direwolf.</li>
<li>Jon Snow was awarded various names like Lord Snow, King Crow, Crow from different people.</li>
<li>The Mountain got his name from his immense size.</li>
<li>The Hound got his name from his House's sigil and his hound shaped helm.</li>
<li>Barristan the Bold was given his nickname by Prince Duncan the Small for his courage of appearing in lists at very young age.</li>
<li>Red Viper got his name due to his sinister reputation and his dabbling in poison. </li>
<li>Black Fish chose his own name when his brother Hoster Tully once called him ""Black goat of Tully flock"". Brynden Tully told his brother that their sigil was a trout so he must be Black fish, not goat.</li>
<li>Lord of Bones proclaimed himself as such. He got that name from wearing an armour made of bones.</li>
</ol>

<p>As you can see, they all chose their names or got their names due to their traits but nothing significant happened at their births, unlike Aemon and Daenerys. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>While there are no canon rules for such nicknames, we can however determine a basic set of how people do get these names from these examples:</p>

<ol>
<li>Significance of events around birth</li>
<li>Some great deed</li>
<li>Some great crime</li>
<li>Some physical feature</li>
<li>Some sort of knowledge</li>
<li>Personal choice</li>
<li>Some outlook trait</li>
<li>Insulting epithet based on some physical disability or low birth etc</li>
<li>Dynasty's sigil</li>

"133829","Why did the Targaryens choose Dragonstone after the visions of Daenys?","<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daenys_Targaryen"">Daenys ""The Dreamer"" Targaryen</a> had visions of the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Doom_of_Valyria"">Doom of Valyria</a>, so <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aenar_Targaryen"">Aenar ""The Exile"" Targaryen</a> relocated his whole clan to <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragonstone"">Dragonstone</a>.</p>

<p>One explanation could be Daenys also foresaw the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Century_of_Blood"">Century of Blood</a>, but did she?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","133837","<p>This cannot be answered from any canon source so following would be informed speculation and logical inference.</p>

<h2>Uncertainty of Dragon Dreams</h2>

<p>Daenys saw doom of Valyria in her dreams. Since we know that dragon dreams are just signs involving dragons, whose truth can vary quite opposite to the dreamer's interpretation, Daenys could not be sure if the dream was about just mainland Valyria or her complete Empire. From <em>Dunk &amp; Egg: The Hedge Knight</em>, we see an example of Dragon dream, seen by Prince <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daeron_Targaryen_(son_of_Maekar_I)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Daeron Targaryen</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I dreamed of you,” said the prince.</p>
  
  <p>“You said that at the inn.”</p>
  
  <p>“Did I? Well, it’s so. My dreams are not like yours, Ser Duncan. Mine
  are true. They frighten me. You frighten me. I dreamed of you and a
  dead dragon, you see. A great beast, huge, with wings so large they
  could cover this meadow. It had fallen on top of you, but you were
  alive and the dragon was dead.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another example of Dragon Dream, dreamed by <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daemon_II_Blackfyre"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Daemon II Blackfyre</a>, from <em>Dunk &amp; Egg: The Mystery Knight</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""A dragon will hatch? A living dragon? What, here?""</p>
  
  <p>""I dreamed it. This pale white castle, you, a dragon bursting from an
  egg, I dreamed it all, just as I once dreamed of my brothers lying
  dead. They were twelve and I was only seven, so they laughed at me,
  and died. I am two-and-twenty now, and I trust my dreams.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you see these, dreams do not indicate exact future. They just symbolise it. In first Dream, the dreamer could not determine which Dragon would be killed by Ser Duncan. In second dream, the dreamer mistook exposing <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon_V_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Prince Aegon</a>'s true identity to be indicative of a real dragon hatching. </p>

<p>So as you can see, Dreams can be wrongly interpreted which is why other Dragon Lords did not believe Daenys' dreams. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Doom of Valyria</h2>

<p>We know that in Doom, Valyria burnt from both earth and air. In ADWD Chapter 38, Tyrion recalls that it was written that on the day of Doom every hill for 500 miles had split asunder to fill the air with ash and smoke and fire, blazes so hot and hungry that even dragons in the sky were engulfed and consumed.</p>

<p>Great rents had opened in the earth, swallowing palaces, temples, entire towns. Lakes boiled or turned to acid, mountains burst, fiery fountains spewed molten rock a thousand feet into the air, red clouds rained down dragonglass and the black blood of demons, and to the north the ground splintered and collapsed and fell in on itself and an angry sea came rushing in</p>

<p>So it is possible that Daenys may have seen fire engulfing Valyria or fire engulfing dragons. Sadly we do not know the exact dream Daenys saw. But since she made her father leave Valyria and Aenar chose Island of Dragonstone, the choice seems to be made with preference of keeping a body of water between Valyria and themselves. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Why Dragonstone?</h2>

<p>Valyrians had conquered Dragonstone 200 years before the Doom. It was at that time the Western most extent of the Valyrian Freehold. So the probable reasons for Aenar's choice seem to be following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Dragonstone was the Western most outpost of Valyria. This was as far as Aenar could have run without exiling himself from the Freehold entirely.</li>
<li>Daenys could not be sure about true extent of her dream. Did it mean the whole Empire or did it mean just Valyria itself? </li>
<li>Dragonstone was an Island and was seperated from rest of the Freehold by Sea. If Daenys had seen a great fire in her vision, it would make sense to put a body of water between them and the great fire. They could not flee to Eastern most outposts of the Freehold because they were all connected to Valyria by Land. Remember Valyria only became an Island after the doom. Before Doom, it was a Peninsula. </li>
</ol>

<p>But judging on these reasons, another candidate land arises. The Island of Lorath. Lorath is Northern most outpost of the former Freehold and it is also an Island. Why did Aenar choose Dragonstone instead of Lorath is something which <s>can't be answered</s> is actually answered by <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/68466/travis-kindred"">Travis Kindred</a> below. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Our esteemed Member <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/68466/travis-kindred"">Travis Kindred</a> has provided an excellent argument about Dragonstone's good environmental conditions for Dragon Breeding.  Not stealing his point, just using it to answer <em>Why did not Aenar choose Lorath instead of Dragonstone?</em>. The Answer would be that Aenar was more inclined to choose Dragonstone because of the favourable environment. Just summarising it for someone who might not reach this conclusion from Travis' answer.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Did She see Essosi wars between Valyrian Colonies?</h2>

<p>We cannot say if she did see that. But even if she did see that, Targaryens would have no cause to worry because they had <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Balerion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a dragon</a> while the colonies had none. Also since Targaryens, Velaryons and Celtigars were of the pure blood of Valyria, they would be most welcome by the city state of Volantis which was the closest to Valyria than all other colonies. So that does not appear to be a reason behind the self-imposed exile to dragonstone. </p>

"199540","How do the ironborn choose their leader?","<p>From having recently watched <em>Game of Thrones</em>, Season 6, Episode 5, ""The Door"", it appears that the ironborn elect their leader.</p>

<p>From the noted episode it looks like leadership contenders gather with a crowd of a few dozen ironborn and make their case for leadership. After Yara makes her case, the gathered crowd chants ""Yara! Yara!..."", and after Euron makes his case, the crowd chants ""Euron! Euron!..."". I imagine the latter is done by more of the crowd and/or louder than for Yara.</p>

<p>From watching the episode, the election seems like a spur-of-the-moment popularity contest to see which contender gets the most/loudest support. </p>

<p><strong>Is the ironborn election any deeper than that?</strong> </p>

<p>As depicted in the episode, the election process struck me as rather shallow in a world that is otherwise deeply fleshed out (I imagined the brevity was necessary for pacing/time constraint reasons in a TV show, which is understandable). Is the ironborn election process explained with more detail in the books, and if so, could someone please describe it?</p>

<p>I've searched GoT/aSoIaF wikis and other search results for ""ironborn election"", etc. but haven't found a detailed description of it.</p>

  <p>A roar went up at that, and the drowned men beat their cudgels one against the other. ""A kingsmoot!"" they shouted. ""A kingsmoot, a kingsmoot. No king but from the kingsmoot!"" And the clamor that they made was so thunderous that surely the Crow's Eye heard the shouts on Pyke, and the vile Storm God in his cloudy hall. And Aeron Damphair knew he had done well.</p>

<p>And it was called by one their ""clergy"", Aeron ""Damphair"" Greyjoy, Balon's brother. Some of those claiming the Seastone Chair don't even believe it;</p>

  <p>""I thought you would have heard. Aeron Damphair has called a kingsmoot.""
  Asha threw back her head and laughed. ""The Drowned God must have shoved a pricklefish up Uncle Aeron's arse. <strong>A kingsmoot? Is this some jape, or does he mean it truly?""</strong></p>

<p>Then all those that wish to claim the throne gather and make a speech and show off their plunder to win the hearts of their fellow ironborn. Below is an example of the first one who made a claim, there were others and each time the treasures they offered were greater and greater.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>His eyes, Aeron saw, were now grey, now blue, as changeable as the seas. Mad eyes, he thought, fool's eyes. The vision he spoke of was doubtless a snare set by the Storm God to lure the ironborn to destruction. The offerings that his men spilled out before the kingsmoot included sealskins and walrus tusks, arm rings made of whalebone, warhorns banded in bronze. The captains looked and turned away, leaving lesser men to help themselves to the gifts. When the fool was done talking and his champions began to shout his name, only the Farwynds took up the cry, and not even all of them. Soon enough the cries of ""Gylbert! Gylbert King!"" faded away to silence.</p>

<p>Euron promised them basically the world, even claiming he could tame dragons with a horn he found.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""IRONMEN,"" said Euron Greyjoy, ""you have heard my horn. Now hear my words. I am Balon's brother, Quellon's eldest living son. Lord Vickon's blood is in my veins, and the blood of the Old Kraken. Yet I have sailed farther than any of them. <strong>Only one living kraken has never known defeat. Only one has never bent his knee. Only one has sailed to Asshai by the Shadow, and seen wonders and terrors beyond imagining . . .""</strong></p>
  
  <p>""If you liked the Shadow so well, go back there,"" called out pink-cheeked Qarl the Maid, one of Asha's champions.</p>
  
  <p>""I know as much of war as you do, Crow's Eye,"" Asha said. ""Aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros with dragons.""</p>
  
  <p>""And so shall we,"" Euron Greyjoy promised. ""That horn you heard I found amongst the smoking ruins that were Valyria, where no man has dared to walk but me. You heard its call, and felt its power. It is a dragon horn, bound with bands of red gold and Valyrian steel graven with enchantments. The dragonlords of old sounded such horns, before the Doom devoured them. <strong>With this horn, ironmen, I can bind dragons to my will.""</strong></p>
  
  <p>Asha laughed aloud. ""A horn to bind goats to your will would be of more use, Crow's Eye. There are no more dragons.""</p>
  
  <p>""Again, girl, you are wrong. There are three, and I know where to find them. Surely that is worth a driftwood crown.""</p>

<p>And in the end Euron laid the best claim and had the most ""votes"";</p>

  <p><strong>The mutes and mongrels from the Silence threw open Euron's chests and spilled out his gifts before the captains and the kings.</strong> Then it was Hotho Harlaw the priest heard, as he filled his hands with gold. Gorold Goodbrother shouted out as well, and Erik Anvil-Breaker. ""EURON! EURON! EURON!"" The cry swelled, became a roar. ""EURON! EURON! CROW'S EYE! EURON KING!"" It rolled up Nagga's hill, like the Storm God rattling the clouds. ""EURON! EURON! EURON! EURON! EURON! EURON!""
  Even a priest may doubt. Even a prophet may know terror. Aeron Damphair reached within himself for his god and discovered only silence. <strong>As a thousand voices shouted out his brother's name, all he could hear was the scream of a rusted iron hinge.</strong></p>

  <p>Elsewhere in Westeros, petty kings claimed crowns of gold by virtue of their birth and blood, but the driftwood crowns of the ironborn were not so easily won. <strong>Here alone in all of Westeros men made their own kings, assembling in great councils called kingsmoots to choose the rock kings and salt kings who would rule over them. Whenever a king died, the priests of the Drowned God would call a kingsmoot to choose his successor.</strong> Every man who owned and captained a boat was allowed a voice at these unruly gatherings, which oft went on for days, and in a few instances far longer. The ironborn also tell of occasions when the priests called ""the captains and the kings"" together to remove an unworthy ruler.</p>
  
  <p><strong>The power wielded by these prophets of the Drowned God over the ironborn should not be underestimated. Only they could summon kingsmoots, and woe to the man, be he lord or king, who dared defy them.</strong> The greatest of the priests was the towering prophet Galon Whitestaff, so-called for the tall carved staff he carried everywhere to smite the ungodly. (In some tales his staff was made of weirwood, in others from one of Nagga's bones.)</p>

<h2>The Iron Islands came under the rule of the Greyjoys when they took it by force and woe to any who opposed them.</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Torgon had struck one blow against the institution of the kingsmoot in his youth, by throwing over its chosen king. In his old age he struck another, calling upon his own son Urragon to help him rule.</strong> At court and council, in war and peace, the son remained at his father's side for the best part of five years, so when Torgon finally died it seemed only natural for his chosen heir to succeed him as Urragon IV Greyiron. <strong>No kingsmoot was summoned, and this time no Galon Whitestaff arose in wroth to protest the succession.</strong></p>
  
  <p>The final, fatal blow against the power of the captains and the kings assembled was dealt when Urragon IV himself died, after a long but undistinguished reign. It had been the dying king's wish that the high kingship pass to his great-nephew Urron Greyiron, salt king of Orkmont, known as Urron Redhand. <strong>The priests of the Drowned God were determined not to allow the power of kingmaking to be taken from them for a third time, so word went forth that the captains and kings should assemble on Old Wyk for a kingsmoot.</strong></p>
  
  <p>Hundreds came, amongst them the salt kings and rock kings of the seven major isles, and even the Lonely Light. Yet scarcely had they gathered when Urron Redhand loosed his axemen on them, and Nagga's ribs ran red with blood. <strong>Thirteen kings died that day, and half a hundred priests and prophets. It was the end of the kingsmoots, and the Redhand ruled as high king for twenty-two years thereafter, and his descendants after him. The wandering holy men never again made and unmade kings as they once had.</strong></p>

<p>&quot;There is an inn at the crossroads up ahead,&quot; Catelyn told him. She had slept many a night there in her youth, traveling with her father. Lord Hoster Tully had been a restless man in his prime, always riding somewhere. She still remembered the innkeep, a fat woman named Masha Heddle who chewed sourleaf night and day and seemed to have an endless supply of smiles and sweet cakes for the children. The sweet cakes had been soaked with honey, rich and heavy on the tongue, but how Catelyn had dreaded those smiles. The sourleaf had stained Masha's teeth a dark red, and made her smile a bloody horror.</p>

<h3>Shade of the evening</h3>
<p>This is a hallucinogenic drug that Dany takes before her visions in the House of the Undying. It is used mainly by the Warlocks of Qarth but considering it's nature it is likely others have gotten a hold of some for recreational use.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When they reached the door—a tall oval mouth, set in a wall fashioned in the likeness of a human face—the smallest dwarf Dany had ever seen was waiting on the threshold. He stood no higher than her knee, his faced pinched and pointed, snoutish, but he was dressed in delicate livery of purple and blue, and his tiny pink hands held a silver tray. Upon it rested a slender crystal glass filled with a thick blue liquid: shade of the evening, the wine of warlocks. &quot;Take and drink,&quot; urged Pyat Pree.</p>
<p>&quot;Will it turn my lips blue?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One flute will serve only to unstop your ears and dissolve the caul from off your eyes, so that you may hear and see the truths that will be laid before you.&quot;</p>
<p>Dany raised the glass to her lips. The first sip tasted like ink and spoiled meat, foul, but when she swallowed it seemed to come to life within her. She could feel tendrils spreading through her chest, like fingers of fire coiling around her heart, and on her tongue was a taste like honey and anise and cream, like mother's milk and Drogo's seed, like red meat and hot blood and molten gold. It was all the tastes she had ever known, and none of them... and then the glass was empty.</p>

<p>The captain took the cup Euron had not offered, sniffed at its contents suspiciously. Seen up close, it looked more blue than black. It was thick and oily, with a smell like rotted flesh. He tried a small swallow, and spit it out at once. &quot;Foul stuff. Do you mean to poison me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I mean to open your eyes.&quot; Euron drank deep from his own cup, and smiled. &quot;Shade-of-the-evening, the wine of the warlocks. I came upon a cask of it when I captured a certain galleas out of Qarth, along with some cloves and nutmeg, forty bolts of green silk, and four warlocks who told a curious tale. One presumed to threaten me, so I killed him and fed him to the other three. They refused to eat of their friend's flesh at first, but when they grew hungry enough they had a change of heart.

"134168","Why is Gregor ""The Mountain"" Clegane still a knight?","<p>In episode 6 of season 1, ""<em>A Golden Crown</em>"", the Hand of the King, Eddard Stark, declared Ser Gregor Clegane an outlaw and stripped him of basically everything, and sentenced him to death on top of that.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the first of his name, King of the Andals and the first men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I charge you to bring the King's justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes. I denounce him and attaint him. (gasps, murmurs, and voices of outrage sound at court) I strip him of all ranks and titles, of all lands and holdings, and sentence him to death.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It looked and sounded like a final decision. Why wasn't this order executed, even after Lord Beric Dondarrion failed? Just because one attempt didn't succeed, doesn't mean the sentence is called off, and yet later The Mountain is seen doing what he did previously. </p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><laws>","134172","<p>In practice, the reason is of course that <strong>he was still useful to the Lannisters</strong>, who hold King's Landing and the Iron Throne. Lord Tywin might allow his faithful dog to be killed for the sake of brokering an alliance with Dorne, but certainly not for the sake of honouring a decree made by one dead man on behalf of another, neither of whom had ever been very friendly towards House Lannister.</p>

<p>So how did they justify their decision to keep Gregor Clegane around, given that in theory they're continuing the succession from King Robert (even though in practice House Lannister essentially seized the throne from House Baratheon)? Well, the sentence might have been pronounced in the name of King Robert, but <strong>it was announced <em>by</em> Ned Stark, a man who shortly afterwards was executed for treason.</strong> The Lannister 'party line' is that Ned betrayed Robert by plotting to take the throne away from his son and heir. Given that, why should any announcements made by Ned, even supposedly in the name of the king, be considered valid? If challenged (and who would dare to challenge them?) the Lannisters could say something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Well, sure, the late Lord Stark wanted to strip Ser Gregor of his lands and titles. That was part of his plan to take the throne for himself, you see; he knew House Clegane's loyalty to the king, so from his point of view, Ser Gregor had to be eliminated so that his master plan to cheat Robert's children of the throne could go ahead.""</p>

"134179","As things stand, will House Stark go extinct?","<p>According to the family tree in <em>A World of Ice and Fire</em> Ned Stark's children are in fact the only surviving Starks.
And as of S06E09;</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Bran is the only legitimate, male Stark.</p>

<p>In the Season Six Finale it is revealed that;</p>

<p>This means that if Jon was legitimised and there was record of his birth in the Citadel;</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> He would become a Targaryen.</p>

<p>So I guess my big question is: Can Bran father children? I find it to be quite an important issue considering House Stark's long term survival depends on it.</p>

<p>In season 4 (I can't remember which episode) Locke Bolton gives Bran a cut on the leg to confirm his identity. Bran reacts only with fear and not pain, indicating that he has no feeling below his waist.</p>

<p>Does this mean that he wouldn't be able to...get it up? And if so, why hasn't the show addressed House Stark's impending doom?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","134306","<h2>Can Bran sire children?</h2>

<p>House Stark is not doomed. Bran is the only surviving legitimate male Stark but he is probably unlikely to father children due to his disability. But he is not the only Stark alive.</p>

<p>Since some of our members seem to believe that Bran can have intercourse and that medical science in Planetos and our world are same, I'd like to quote Eddard Stark:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I dreamed of Bran,” Sansa had whispered to him. “I saw him smiling.”</p>
  
  <p>“He was going to be a knight,” Arya was saying now. “A knight of the
  Kingsguard. Can he still be a knight?”</p>
  
  <p>“No,” Ned said. He saw no use in lying to her. “Yet someday he may be
  the lord of a great holdfast and sit on the king’s council. He might
  raise castles like Brandon the Builder, or sail a ship across the
  Sunset Sea, or enter your mother’s Faith and become the High Septon.”
  But he will never run beside his wolf again, he thought with a sadness
  too deep for words, <strong>or lie with a woman, or hold his own son in his
  arms</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is the only mention of Bran's ability to procreate as far as I can recall. And his own father seems to believe that Bran can never lie with a woman aka have sex and he would never sire a child. </p>

<p>But I also have to add that I am not a medical expert to provide a definite ruling on the matter. I am only building on what the author has provided us with in the books. </p>

<p>In any case, Can Bran have children? Maybe, Maybe not. Do other characters in universe seem to think he will have children? No they don't. </p>

<h2>Other surviving Starks</h2>

<p>But despite all that, Bran has two legitimate sisters; Sansa Stark and Arya Stark. Arya is still too young but Sansa is of age to bear children. Any children Arya and Sansa may bear can carry the Stark name and inherit the North from their uncle Brandon Stark. Any man they might marry can also take Stark name and the children born out of such union will be just as much Stark as children of a male Stark.</p>

<p>Also in the books, Rickon is still alive and is therefore heir to Bran.</p>

<h2>Precedence for female line</h2>

<p>There is precedence for female line furthering a great House. </p>

<p>This is not the first time for House Stark to look to female line for survival if Wildlings can be believed. Lord <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Brandon_Stark_(the_daughterless)"" rel=""noreferrer"">Brandon Stark</a> fathered no children except a daughter. The daughter was supposedly abducted by King Beyond the Wall, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bael_the_Bard"" rel=""noreferrer"">Bael the Bard</a>. Brandon was distraught because this meant extinction of House Stark. But later the girl was found with a child fathered by Bael. That child was brought up as a Stark and succeeded his grandfather upon his death. </p>

<p>House Lannister was once in a similar dilemma. King <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Gerold_III_Lannister"" rel=""noreferrer"">Gerold III Lannister</a> died without a male issue. He had only one daughter and she was married to a Knight named <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Joffrey_Lannister"" rel=""noreferrer"">Joffrey Lydden</a>. Upon King Gerold's death, Ser Joffrey was crowned as King of the Rock by council of Westerlander nobility and he took the name Lannister due to his marriage to the Princess of the Rock. He ascended to the throne as King Joffrey I Lannister. Current Lannisters are descended from King Joffrey and daughter of King Gerold, no one considers them to be ""not real Lannisters"". </p>

<p>Another example is given in succession crisis of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Hornwood"" rel=""noreferrer"">House Hornwood</a><sup>*</sup>. Lord <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Halys_Hornwood"" rel=""noreferrer"">Halys Hornwood</a> died in <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_on_the_Green_Fork"" rel=""noreferrer"">battle against Tywin Lannister</a>. His only legitimate child <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daryn_Hornwood"" rel=""noreferrer"">Daryn Hornwood</a> died in <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_in_the_Whispering_Wood"" rel=""noreferrer"">battle against Jaime Lannister</a>. The considered candidates to carry on Hornwood names were:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Larence_Snow"" rel=""noreferrer"">Larence Snow</a> - A bastard son of Lord Halys Hornwood. He could be legitimized by King in the North to be the next Lord Hornwood. </li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Beren_Tallhart"" rel=""noreferrer"">Beren Tallhart</a> -  Younger son of Lord Halys' sister, Berena Hornwood. <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Leobald_Tallhart"" rel=""noreferrer"">His father</a> offered that Beren would take Hornwood name if he was to be named heir of Halys Hornwood. </li>
</ol>

<p>Another example is kindly reminded by <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/24024/broklynite"">Broklynite</a>. Lady <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Maege_Mormont"" rel=""noreferrer"">Maege Mormont</a>'s children carry the Mormont name. It is unclear who is the father of those kids. When Maege's brother Jeor Mormont abdicated his seat and took the black, Jeor's son Jorah Mormont became Lord of Bear Island. Jorah then went into exile without siring any kids so Maege Mormont became lady of Bear Island. Her children are considered Mormonts. (But this would be a weak example because we do not know who is her husband. If he is/was a Mormont as well, this example won't hold). </p>

<p>So even if Lords of the North refuse to have Sansa as their Queen like Lords of Westerlands refused to have King Gerold's daughter as their Queen, Sansa's husband can instead be crowned as King in the North (Now you know why Petyr Baelish was so eager to marry Sansa) if he takes the Stark name just like Joffrey Lydden. </p>

<p><sub>* The Succession crisis of House Hornwood never occurred in the show.</sub></p>

<h2>Who can take Stark name?</h2>

<p>By law, a man can only take Stark name:</p>

<ol>
<li>By right of marriage to a Stark woman</li>
<li>By right of descent from a Stark woman</li>
<li>By grant of legitimization decree for removal of bastardy taint from the King provided he is a bastard of a Stark man or woman.</li>
<li>By right of birth to a Stark man in wedlock (The normal way)</li>
</ol>

<p>There is no other way or precedent to be a Stark. So Arya, Jon and Sansa all have equal potential to further the Stark line even if Bran cannot.</p>

<h2>Why show hasn't showed that potential succession crisis?</h2>

<p>Because there is no succession crisis. if Bran comes back to take his place as King in the North as eldest surviving son of Eddard Stark and reveals that Jon is not a Stark, House Stark is still not doomed. Even if Bran fathers no children, Sansa stands as his heir. Whoever marries Sansa can take the Stark name for himself and the children of that man and Sansa will be named Starks. Even Jon can take Stark name if he wishes due to his descent from sister of Lord Eddard Stark if Bran legitimizes him (Ironically, Jon would then also be able to take Targaryen name, not just Stark name). </p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","134317","<p>He is talking about Jon. </p>

<p>Jon was born somewhere in South (We know it is Dorne but most people do not). </p>

<p>Jon is a bastard whose mother is unknown to most people. Therefore, Jon is the motherless bastard born in South while Sansa is the trueborn daughter born in Winterfell.</p>

<p>Also, Littlefinger could not possibly know about true parentage of Jon. Only two people knew of it; Lord Howland Reed and Lord Eddard Stark. And Eddard had openly declared Jon to be his son in front of the whole realm so that's what Littlefinger knows as well. This is proved by Baelish's conversation with Sansa in S06E05:</p>

║ Monarch     ║ Number of Dragons ║
╠═════════════╬═══════════════════╣
║ Aegon I     ║ 3                 ║
╠═════════════╬═══════════════════╣
║ Jaehaerys I ║ 8                 ║
╠═════════════╬═══════════════════╣
║ Viserys I   ║ 20                ║
╠═════════════╬═══════════════════╣
║ Aegon III   ║ 4                 ║
╚═════════════╩═══════════════════╝
</code></pre>

<p>By taking only the distinct dragons from sets of these monarchs we get the final estimate of 25.</p>

<p>So it is safe to say that <strong>there were 25 known dragons in Westeros</strong>.</p>

<p>The complete list of known Dragons, their riders and their fate would be:</p>

<h2>Second highest number of Dragons in Westeros</h2>

<p>The second highest number would be during reign of King <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jaehaerys_I_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Jaehaerys I</a> (48-103 AC), in which at least 8 Dragons were alive. It is said during the great tourney of King's Landing, there were so many dragons that King's Landing appeared to be new Valyria. Those 8 dragons might have been:</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> There are legends about a Dragon <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Urrax"" rel=""noreferrer"">Urrax</a> who may have lived in time of the first men but we will not enter him to our list unless GRRM confirms existence of Urrax and of the Knight <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Serwyn_of_the_Mirror_Shield"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ser Serwyn of Mirror Shield</a> who killed it. It appears to be a fabricated story because in times of Ser Serwyn, there were no Knights in Westeros. Knights came with Andals who did not exist in Westeros at that time. Also, The legends say he may have been a Kingsguard but that is also false because Order of Kingsguard was established after the Conquest by Queen Visenya.  We will discuss only confirmed dragons, which are Targaryen dragons.</p>

I am asking this because I am confused with hair colors of Jon Snow, Tyrion Lannister, Tommen Baratheon (Lannister), House Stark, Rob Stark etc. Whose genetic is more dominant than others? Is there any genetics dominance chart for GoT?</p>

<p>Also, in GoT usually noble men from the houses marry noble women from other houses. How do female genetics work? Do female characters bring any genetics from their houses or male genetics are always the dominant factor.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","134595","<p><strong>Genetics in-universe appear to follow real-world genetics.</strong></p>

<p>All the examples you list follow the dominant trait of their parents:</p>

  <p>Parents are Lyanna Stark (mother) and Rhaegar Targaryen (father). Lyanna had <strong>dark hair (dominant)</strong> while Rhaegar had silver/blonde hair (recessive). <strong>Jon has dark hair</strong>.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>Alternate theory: Parents are Joanna Lannister and Aerys ""The Mad King"" Targaryen. This is a popular theory because Tyrion's hair color has been described as closer to silver, which is a trait of Targaryens.

<p><strong>Tommen Baratheon:</strong></p>

  <p>Parents are Cersei Lannister (mother) and Jaime Lannister (father). Tommen is not related to King Robert, despite having the Baratheon name. <strong>Both</strong> his biological parents have <strong>blonde hair</strong>. <strong>Tommen has blonde hair.</strong></p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Prince Daeron and Hard Hugh Hammer don't have any kills to their names because their dragons won their kill points while being riderless. Also it must be noted that Queen Jaehaera Targaryen and her brother Jaehaerys were not technically dragon riders. They were bonded to the dragons but they never actually rode them. They are in the list just for the sake of completion.</p>

"134649","To what extent does Jon Snow have abilities as a Warg","<p>In <em>A Clash of Kings</em>, we witness Jon warging into Ghost and getting attacked by the eagle. As far as I can recall, he doesn't warg in the show after that point. </p>

<p>My questions are the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is Jon aware of his ability as a warg? I've read that all Stark children possessed the ability, such as Arya with Nymeria. </li>
<li>If Jon is a warg, would that mean Bran as the Three Eyed Raven could possibly Warg (time travel?) with Jon and show him the scene of the reveal of his parentage? Or does that ability lie with the Greenseers like the Three Eyed Raven?</li>
</ol>

<p>With regards to the related question, I was more asking on whether Jon was aware that he was able to warg, not whether he was able to control or choose what he wargs into, although the latter ties into the former.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><jon-snow>","134650","<h2>Jon's Capability</h2>

<p>All Stark Children show the gift of Skin Changing <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Quite_a_Few_Questions"" rel=""noreferrer"">as GRRM confirmed</a>. </p>

<p>Jon and Bran are described as particularly powerful Skinchangers. Bran is even more special because he is the Winged-wolf while his siblings aren't. </p>

<p>Jon has shown his abilities (Unintentionally) as a warg on following occasions:</p>

<ol>
<li>In controlling his wolf. There is no such thing as a tame direwolf. </li>
<li>Spying on Wildling Army in Frost Fangs while on a ranging with Qhorin Halfhand. Jon was asleep and Ghost was miles away, yet Jon managed to slip into the skin of his wolf and see what was waiting ahead of them.</li>
<li>He slipped into Ghost's skin after the Battle of Castle Black when he was standing beyond the wall and Ghost came back from the wild.</li>
</ol>

<p>Jon warged into his wolf to scout the Wildling army albeit unintentionally. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And suddenly <strong>he was back in the mountains, his paws sunk deep in a
  drift of snow as he stood upon the edge of a great precipice</strong>. Before
  him the Skirling Pass opened up into airy emptiness, and a long
  vee-shaped valley lay spread beneath him like a quilt, awash in all
  the colors of an autumn afternoon.</p>
  
  <p>A vast blue-white wall plugged one end of the vale, squeezing between
  the mountains as if it had shouldered them aside, and for a moment he
  thought he had dreamed himself back to Castle Black. Then he realized
  he was looking at a river of ice several thousand feet high. Under
  that glittering cold cliff was a great lake, its deep cobalt waters
  reflecting the snowcapped peaks that ringed it. <strong>There were men down
  in the valley, he saw now; many men, thousands, a huge host</strong>.<br>
  <sub> <em>A Clash Of Kings: Chapter 53</em> </sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jon's comrades when scouting the Skirling Pass were the first to realize Jon was a warg after he told them about his ""dream"".</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It made him feel half a fool to talk of such things to Qhorin and the
  other rangers, but he did as he was commanded. None of the black
  brothers laughed at him, however. By the time he was done, even Squire
  Dalbridge was no longer smiling.</p>
  
  <p><strong>“Skinchanger?” said Ebben grimly</strong>, looking at the Halfhand. Does he mean the eagle? Jon wondered. Or me? Skinchangers and wargs belonged
  in Old Nan’s stories, not in the world he had lived in all his life.
  Yet here, in this strange bleak wilderness of rock and ice, it was not
  hard to believe.</p>
  
  <p>“The cold winds are rising. Mormont feared as much. Benjen Stark felt
  it as well. Dead men walk and the trees have eyes again. <strong>Why should
  we balk at wargs and giants?</strong>”<br>
  <sub> <em>A Clash Of Kings: Chapter 53</em> </sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later Jon accepted it as well and started to understand it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>it was a hunger inside him, sharp as a dragonglass blade. A hunger...
  he could feel it. <strong>It was food he needed, prey, a red deer that stank
  of fear or a great elk proud and defiant. He needed to kill and fill
  his belly with fresh meat and hot dark blood. His mouth began to water
  with the thought</strong>.</p>
  
  <p><strong>It was a long moment before he understood what was happening. When he did, he bolted to his feet. “Ghost?”</strong> He turned toward the wood,
  and there he came, padding silently out of the green dusk, the breath
  coming warm and white from his open jaws. “Ghost!” he shouted, and the
  direwolf broke into a run.<br>
  <sub> <em>A Storm Of Swords: Chapter 79</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2>Is Jon aware of his power?</h2>

<p>Jon is aware that he is a Warg. He was told that by the Wildlings when he went beyond the Wall with the Old Bear and the rest of the Night's Watch on the Great Ranging. Later he was taunted as ""Beast boy"" and ""Warg"" by Night's Watch Men who wished him ill. But Jon is untrained in the art, unlike Bran who is trained by the Three Eyed Raven himself. </p>

<p>Not only did Jon know it, the Wildings knew it, many people in the Watch knew it and so do some Northern aristocrats such as Cregan Karstark:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cregan: I see what you are, Snow. <strong>Half a wolf and half a wildling,
  baseborn get of a traitor and a whore</strong>. You would deliver a highborn
  maid to the bed of some stinking savage. Did you sample her yourself
  first? If you mean to kill me, do it and be damned for a kinslayer.
  Stark and Karstark are one blood.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Jon notes in ASOS, Men of the NW call him a warg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“What everyone knows is that Ser Alliser is a knight from a noble
  line, and trueborn, while I’m the bastard who killed Qhorin Halfhand
  and bedded with a spearwife. <strong>The warg, I’ve heard them call me</strong>.
  How can I be a warg without a wolf, I ask you?” His mouth twisted. “I
  don’t even dream of Ghost anymore. All my dreams are of the crypts, of
  the stone kings on their thrones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, Janos Slynt declared him for a Warg in front of everyone in the Night's Watch elections for the new Lord Commander.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lord Janos started sputtering again. “This, this is an outrage. We
  ought to hang this boy. <strong>Yes! Hang him, I say, hang him for a
  turncloak and a warg</strong>, along with his friend Mance Rayder. Lord
  Commander? I will not have it, I will not suffer it!”<br>
  <sub> <em>A Storm Of Swords</em> </sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Slynt also said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lord Janos was red-faced and quivering. “The beast,” he gasped. “Look!
  The beast that tore the life from Halfhand. <strong>A warg walks among us,
  brothers. A WARG!</strong> This... this creature is not fit to lead us! This
  beastling is not fit to live!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wildling Skinchanger, Varamyr, knew it as well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He had known what Snow was the moment he saw that great white direwolf
  stalking silent at his side. <strong>One skinchanger can always sense
  another</strong>. Mance should have let me take the direwolf. There would be
  a second life worthy of a king. He could have done it, he did not
  doubt. The gift was strong in Snow, but the youth was untaught, still
  fighting his nature when he should have gloried in it.<br>
  <sub> <em>A Dance With Dragons: Prologue</em> </sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wildlings who saw Jon kill Qhorin also said this in front of him:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“<strong>The lad’s a warg, or close enough</strong>,” put in Ragwyle, the big
  spearwife. “His wolf took a piece o’ Halfhand’s leg.”</p>
  
  <p>The Weeper’s red rheumy eyes gave Jon another look. “Aye? Well, he has
  a wolfish cast to him, now as I look close. Bring him to Mance, might
  be he’ll keep him.” He wheeled his horse around and galloped off, his
  riders hard behind him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later Rattleshirt said this in front of Jon and the council of Wildling chiefs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The black bastard what gutted Orell,” said Rattleshirt, “<strong>and a
  bloody warg as well.</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2>Can Bran take Jon with him?</h2>

<p>Difference between Bran and Jon is that Jon is a skinchanger but Bran is a Greenseer. The Three Eyed Raven chose him as his successor and the Children of The Forest hinted that they were waiting for Bran for a long time. Which means Bran is either some sort of a prophesied Messiah or he is exceptionally talented. While we have seen that two Greenseers can tag along in visions but it has never been disclosed if a Greenseer can take a normal human or a common warg with him in visions. </p>

"134678","Is Sansa and Tyrion's marriage still legitimate?","<p>As of the end of Season 6 of Game of Thrones, it seems very likely that Daenerys and her fleet/army will, at some point, come into contact with Jon Snow and the North.  It's entirely possible that they'll become allies - they both want the Lannisters removed from power, and they have a mutual friend in Theon Greyjoy.</p>

<p>As Daenerys said, ""The best way to make alliances is with marriage.""  I know there's been a lot of speculation about a possible marriage between</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Daenerys and Jon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what about the fact that Daenerys's Hand of the Queen has already been married to Jon's sister?  And the relationship between Tyrion and Sansa, while not exactly loving, was better than how Tyrion and Shae's time ended, and certainly went better than Sansa and Ramsay's marriage.  So the two of them might be amenable to the idea of marrying for the sake of their respective factions.</p>

<p>But a lot has happened since then - Sansa was married to Ramsay, and Tyrion was convicted of murdering his nephew and fled the kingdom after killing his father.  And the lords of the north might not be so keen to kneel to a Lannister.  If the marriage is no longer seen as legitimate by the populace then it would defeat the purpose of sealing the alliance.</p>

<p>So my question is: <strong>Assuming Sansa and Tyrion want to resume their marriage, is there any law, custom, or precedent in Westeros that could prevent them from doing so?</strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","134691","<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Marriage"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wiki of course, where else would we get our knowledge?</a></p>

<h3>The Books</h3>

<p>The Wikia page states that a marriage can be annulled if it is not consummated, this can only happen by request and must be approved by The High Septon <strong>or</strong> A Council of Faith.</p>

<p>That means that a marriage is not automatically invalid if not consummated.</p>

<h3>The TV series</h3>

<p>In the TV series it is stated many times that the marriage between Sansa and Tyrion is not legit because they did not consummate it. Most of the times this is said by the people who want to marry Sansa to someone else or benefit from their lack of marriage.</p>

<p><strong>If</strong> the TV series would follow the rules of marriage of the books, then Sansa's marriage to Ramsey would not be legitimate but her marriage to Tyrion could be.</p>

<p>The information of how an annulment would work could be kept as a plot twist for when the 2 characters meet again.</p>

<p><strong>Or</strong> the TV series has already given us all the information about marriages and thus not consummating the wedding automatically annuls it, if we are to believe what has been said by (for example) Littlefinger.</p>

<p>In that case, Sansa is now a widow.</p>

<h3>Extra</h3>

<p>The wikia also states that women, who are forced to marry while being a hostage (not to be confused with simply being forced by their parents) can also ask for an annulment.</p>

<p>So Sansa could still ask for an annulment because she was forced to marry Tyrion.</p>

"200450","What is Renly's eye colour?","<p>In the <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> series first it is mentioned by Sansa that Renly's eye colour is green. He wears green clothes to bring the colour of his eyes.</p>

","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","200454","<p>GRRM admitted it was a mistake. He also said earlier that Renly's eye colour is blue-green, which can appear one or the other to the viewer depending on what Renly's wearing. </p>

  <p>He did note with some amusement that his readers catch his mistakes
  for him (Renly's eyes being green once, then blue, and then calling
  them 'blue-green eyes that changed color depending on what he wears'

<p>You must note of course that the POV style chapters are not <a href=""https://www.nownovel.com/blog/unreliable-narrator/"" rel=""noreferrer"">100% accurate</a>. Sansa for example also <em>thinks</em> that the Hound kissed her before leaving King's Landing when in fact he never did. </p>

It seems like a real failed opportunity. </p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","200483","<p><strong>One step at a time now...</strong></p>

Old Walder Frey will not object to his fat little Walda becoming a queen. White Harbor might prove troublesome should Lord Wyman survive this coming battle … but I am quite sure that he will not.

"201918","Ghost as a Foreshadowing of Jon Snow's Lineage","<p>I was watching the first GoT episode and I remember reading or hearing somewhere that the scene in the forest with the dead stag and direwolf is a foreshadowing device used by the writers.  I know that Jon mentions that the 5 direwolf pups can represent the 5 stark children.  But then Jon finds the albino direwolf.  Considering the white fur, is this foreshadowing of Jon's true lineage?  Is there any proof that this is what Martin or Weiss/Benioff intended?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><jon-snow>","202027","<h1>Possibly, though only with broad strokes to signify Jon is different.</h1>

<p>The dead direwolf and the pups forms part of a foreshadowing for the whole of book 1/season 1 in that Ned going down south will ultimately kill him. An antler killed the direwolf and we know a the direwolf is of House Stark and the stag of House Baratheon. It even worries Catelyn in universe when she thinks of the signs this sends.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It took Ned a moment to comprehend her words, but when the understanding came, the darkness left his eyes. ""Robert is coming here?"" When she nodded, a smile broke across his face.</p>
  
  <p>Catelyn wished she could share his joy. But she had heard the talk in the yards; a direwolf dead in the snow, a broken antler in its throat. Dread coiled within her like a snake, but she forced herself to smile at this man she loved, this man who put no faith in signs. ""I knew that would please you,"" she said. ""We should send word to your brother on the Wall.""</p>
  
  <p><sub><em>A Game of Thrones</em>, Catelyn I</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, there is some significance to Ghost compared to the rest of the group, it is meant to show Jon as an outsider, the bastard <strong>Snow</strong> and not a Stark. Ghost is found away from the others having been shunned away and of course has white ""snowy"" fur.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""There,"" Jon said. He swung his horse around and galloped back across the bridge. They watched him dismount where the direwolf lay dead in the snow, watched him kneel. A moment later he was riding back to them, smiling.</p>
  
  <p>""He must have crawled away from the others,"" Jon said.</p>
  
  <p>""Or been driven away,"" their father said, looking at the sixth pup. His fur was white, where the rest of the litter was grey. His eyes were as red as the blood of the ragged man who had died that morning. Bran thought it curious that this pup alone would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind.</p>
  
  <p>""An albino,"" Theon Greyjoy said with wry amusement. ""This one will die even faster than the others.""</p>
  
  <p>Jon Snow gave his father's ward a long, chilling look. ""I think not, Greyjoy,"" he said. ""This one belongs to me.""</p>
  
  <p><sub><em>A Game of Thrones</em>, Bran I</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course the Stark banner is of a grey direwolf, which all the main Stark's direwolves were, so this is again to show the Jon is different. I don't think it is in anyway to give a hint of who he really is just that he's not quite a Stark. Of course, as noted by Bran, there is some significance to Ghost having already opened his eyes but I'm not quite 100% sure what this could be signifying.</p>

<p>Just to note that there were 5 direwolf pups initially found 3 male and 2 female as there are 3 male and 2 female trueborn children of Ned and Catelyn and so there is significance to the pups themselves. Which, as previously mentioned, translates to Ghost being separated and different from the rest, as Jon is.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Lord Stark,"" Jon said. It was strange to hear him call Father that, so formal. Bran looked at him with desperate hope. ""There are five pups,"" he told Father. ""Three male, two female.""</p>
  
  <p>""What of it, Jon?""</p>
  
  <p>""You have five trueborn children,"" Jon said. ""Three sons, two daughters. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord.""</p>
  
  <p>Bran saw his father's face change, saw the other men exchange glances. He loved Jon with all his heart at that moment. Even at seven, Bran understood what his brother had done. The count had come right only because Jon had omitted himself. He had included the girls, included even Rickon, the baby, but not the bastard who bore the surname Snow, the name that custom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own.</p>
  
  <p><sub><em>A Game of Thrones</em>, Bran I</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's also worth noting Ned's words earlier about Ghost ""Or been driven away"". It could be that the mother drove Ghost away from the others as she lay dying just as Cat had been driving Jon away for a long time because he is ""different"".</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""What of Jon Snow, my lord?"" Maester Luwin asked.</p>
  
  <p>Catelyn tensed at the mention of the name. Ned felt the anger in her, and pulled away.</p>
  
  <p>Many men fathered bastards. Catelyn had grown up with that knowledge. It came as no surprise to her, in the first year of her marriage, to learn that Ned had fathered a child on some girl chance met on campaign. He had a man's needs, after all, and they had spent that year apart, Ned off at war in the south while she remained safe in her father's castle at Riverrun. Her thoughts were more of Robb, the infant at her breast, than of the husband she scarcely knew. He was welcome to whatever solace he might find between battles. And if his seed quickened, she expected he would see to the child's needs.</p>
  
  <p>He did more than that. The Starks were not like other men. Ned brought his bastard home with him, and called him ""son"" for all the north to see. When the wars were over at last, and Catelyn rode to Winterfell, Jon and his wet nurse had already taken up residence.
  That cut deep. Ned would not speak of the mother, not so much as a word, but a castle has no secrets, and Catelyn heard her maids repeating tales they heard from the lips of her husband's soldiers. They whispered of Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, deadliest of the seven knights of Aerys's Kingsguard, and of how their young lord had slain him in single combat. And they told how afterward Ned had carried Ser Arthur's sword back to the beautiful young sister who awaited him in a castle called Starfall on the shores of the Summer Sea. The Lady Ashara Dayne, tall and fair, with haunting violet eyes. It had taken her a fortnight to marshal her courage, but finally, in bed one night, Catelyn had asked her husband the truth of it, asked him to his face.</p>
  
  <p>That was the only time in all their years that Ned had ever frightened her. ""Never ask me about Jon,"" he said, cold as ice. ""He is my blood, and that is all you need to know. And now I will learn where you heard that name, my lady."" She had pledged to obey; she told him; and from that day on, the whispering had stopped, and Ashara Dayne's name was never heard in Winterfell again.</p>
  
  <p>Whoever Jon's mother had been, Ned must have loved her fiercely, for nothing Catelyn said would persuade him to send the boy away. It was the one thing she could never forgive him. She had come to love her husband with all her heart, but she had never found it in her to love Jon. She might have overlooked a dozen bastards for Ned's sake, so long as they were out of sight. Jon was never out of sight, and as he grew, he looked more like Ned than any of the trueborn sons she bore him. Somehow that made it worse. ""Jon must go,"" she said now.</p>

<p>Lastly, it is worth noting that George R. R. Martin employs a three step foreshadowing process and this is almost certainly the first step in that process that something is different with Jon. As such it is only signifying something is different with Jon through very general broad strokes rather than pointing to where he possibly came from.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q: Anne, although you're the envy of many a GRRM fan, do you ever wish you didn't have to edit the books so that you could be surprised by them all at once along with the rest of us?</p>
  
  <p>A: No. As above, he doesn’t tell me a lot. He feels I am most effective at my job if I am surprised along with everyone else. And it is easier to tell when he’s overplaying a hand and revealing things too early if you don’t actually know going in what will happen. <strong>That said, now that I’ve realized his three-fold revelation strategy, I see it in play almost every time. The first, subtle hint for the really astute readers, followed later by the more blatant hint for the less attentive, followed by just spelling it out for everyone else.</strong> It’s a brilliant strategy, and highly effective.</p>

"135356","Elite troops and Single Combat in Westeros","<p>We know personal skills are not that important in a medieval battle. Discipline was one of the two crucial aspects of almost all medieval battles, the other being numbers. In fact, this is something Stannis acknowledges as well.</p>

<p>Romans usually tried to withdraw and regroup when they lost formation. Their formation, a.k.a, discipline enabled them to conquer 60% of the known world.</p>

<p>Of course, there are many exceptions. I bet the most classical example is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Keresztes"" rel=""nofollow"">Battle of Keresztes</a>, where the Crusader army routed the Ottoman army but repelled by the military logistics group, i.e., cooks, pages etc.</p>

<p>In this era, there are so many fabled elite units, famous for their discipline. The obvious example is Polish Hussars, while Swiss Armored Pikemen are just a little behind. If we intend to extend the list, Janissaries, Tercio Pikemen, Varangian Guards and Catapracts would come next. These elite troops were to rally routing troops, keep formation, break through enemy lines etc. None of these tasks could be performed by peasant levies.  </p>

<p><em>However, with the exception of Kingsguard, there are no elite troops in Westeros</em></p>

<p>This is not specific to Westeros. The only elite troops we have heard of in Essos is Unsullied. It seems like no one in Planetos cares about elite troops. In fact, it is even worse for Westeros. <strong>How does Kingsguard fight in formation, where discipline is way more important than combat skills?</strong> It feels like seven thickly armored troops would jeopardize the entire regiment.</p>

<p>I am not suggesting they are useless. They may be used to break the formation (as much as seven men can do), reach and kill the enemy general or protect their own general. Their primary purpose is protecting. We also see Kingsguard represent the king in his absence.</p>

<p>Now comes the single combat part. If the enemy general, without loss of generality lets call him Rhaegar, were to face single combat with the allied general, who shall be called Robert, <strong>where are the Kingsguard?</strong> Of course, this is apart from those protecting someone else, who we shall name Lyanna. <strong>If the single combatters are not generals, i.e., two prominent knights, do the rest of the troops around them stop fighting?</strong></p>

<p>It feels like warfare in Medieval Europe is quite off compared to warfare in Westeros, or Planetos in general. The final part of my question is <strong>if we know any famous single combats in battlefield in Medieval Europe.</strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><warfare><medieval>","135363","<h2>Kingsguard are not a battle unit</h2>

<p>Kingsguard are elite bodyguards, not elite shock troops. They do not fight in formation i.e. 7 armored knights whacking anything that comes their way. They are used to take command of different battle units or to protect someone of Royal blood during battle. E.g. Barristan Selmy was sent to take command of dispersed Targaryen troops after Battle of Bells. Prince Lewyn Martell was given command of Dornish Troops at Trident. </p>

<p>So Kingsguard are usually commanders, not foot Soldiers. </p>

<h2>What do Kingsguard do in Single Combat?</h2>

<p>Kingsguard are first and foremost sworn to obey those of the Royal Blood. If they are explicitly commanded to do so, they would most likely stay away. Example would be how King Robert commanded Ser Barristan to stay aside while he takes the boar alone. </p>

<p>The only scenario that I can recall which comes very close is Trial of Seven between King Maegor and Warrior's sons. King Maegor was supported by Kingsguard but they all fought. In the end everyone died, Except King Maegor, who fell into coma right after killing his last foe. </p>

<h2>If Single Combatants are not Generals, what happens?</h2>

<p>Then nobody knows what happens because no one is important enough to be written down in annals of history. They would most likely be interrupted by other soldiers of both sides who may come to support their comrade. </p>

<p>In response to your edit regarding Prominent Knights, since we do not know of enough Knightly Single combats, it would be speculation. </p>

<p>Knights and highborns are captured for ransom so It is unlikely that any man who believes he is good enough to win the ransom would let it pass. </p>

<p>But on the other hand, The only mention of two prominent knights fighting in a huge battle that I can recall right now is fight between Lyn Corbray and Lewyn Martell. Since Lyn is credited for the Kill, it appears no one interfered. Another mention would be the fight between Ser Arthur Dayne and the Smiling knight. That battle also seems to be uninterrupted by other soldiers. </p>

<h2>Disciplined units</h2>

<p>The majority of Armies in Westeros is made up of untrained levies who are poorly equipped and untrained. They gain experience on job. To support them and harden them, there are trained sworn swords and Knights who are well disciplined. </p>

<h2>Rallying routed troops, keeping formation, breaking through enemy lines</h2>

<p>You are right, Peasant levies do not do that. That's why they have heavily armored mounted Knights. They lead the charge on their warhorses and break enemy lines with their lances. They enjoy mobility and can move freely to rally the running foot soldiers. </p>

<p>Kingsguard can however play a role in rallying shattered levies using their charisma and reputation. Ser Barristan Selmy and Ser Jonathor Darry were sent to rally the broken remnants of Lord Jon Connington's troops. </p>

<h2>Do we know any single Combats in Europe?</h2>

<p>That's off-topic. You can take it up on History Stack Exchange. Nevertheless, One Example that I have found is single combat between <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Peresvet"">a Russian Monk and a Mongol Soldier</a> before Battle of Kulikovo.  </p>

<p>Other than middle-ages. there is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Smith_(explorer)#Early_adventures"">John Smith</a> who reportedly killed and beheaded three Ottoman soldiers in single Combat during campaign of Michael the Brave. </p>

"135751","Is there any evidence to suggest Petyr has slept with Catelyn and/or Lysa?","<p>I'm currently partway through ASOS and just read the line by Littlefinger saying: </p>

<p>I also recall that in ACOK Littlefinger mentions having slept with Catelyn (although that might just be me remembering wrong).</p>

<p>I was wondering whether there is evidence that Littlefinger did in fact sleep with one or the other, or whether it's just a ploy to convince the Council to play along in his grand scheme?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","135755","<h1>Catelyn</h1>
<p>Littlefinger has definitely NOT slept with Catelyn.</p>
<p>Early in <em>A Game of Thrones</em> when Cat is traveling with Ser Roderick to King's Landing, the two have a discussion that Ser Roderick should be the one to go ashore and find the person they are looking because there are some people who may recognize Catelyn.</p>
<p>Catelyn knows who this means... Petyr Baelish. She tells Ser Roderick that the two of them were raised at Riverrun together and Petyr had developed a unrequited love for Catelyn. He even went as far as to challenge Brandon Stark (Ned's older brother) to a duel. Petyr lost this encounter and was sent away from Riverrun. Catelyn was 15 and this was the last time she saw Petyr until her arrival at King's Landing.</p>
<p>Any suggestions that these two were intimate are misleading and false.</p>

<p>Putting this in spoilers because, you may not have reached this part of ASOS yet...</p>

<p> As part of Littlefinger's plot to climb the ladder of power he decides to marry Lysa. Their marriage is definitely consummated...</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
<p> Lysa also has words with Petyr:

<em>&quot;... I've always loved you. I've proved it, haven't I? I gave you my maiden's gift. I would have given you a son too...&quot;</em>

<em>&quot;Cat never gave you anything. It was me who got you your first post...&quot;</em>

<h3>Show</h3>

<p>Joffrey Baratheon is poisoned at his wedding feast and dies.</p>

<p>Cersei then accuses Tyrion of poisoning her son:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Cersei:</strong> He did this. He poisoned my son, your king. Take him.</p>

<p>In Season 6 Episode 10 we see Cersei burns Sept of Baelor and Tommen commits suicide shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>Then following conversation takes place:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Qyburn:</strong> What are your thoughts concerning the king's funeral? As the
  Sept of Baelor is no longer an option, perhaps a ceremony in the

  <p><strong>Cersei:</strong> He should be with his grandfather, his brother, his sister.
  Burn him and bury his ashes where the sept once stood.</p>

<p>This implies that Joffrey's remains were interned in the Sept of Baelor along with Tywin's and Myrcella's. </p>

<hr>

<h3>Books</h3>

<p>Joffrey Baratheon is poisoned at his wedding feast by Tyrells according to Petyr Baelish and dies. Baelish would never lie about such stuff<sup>1</sup>. His brother Tommen inherits the Iron Throne as the result. </p>

<p>From ASOS Chapter 60, Cersei accuses Tyrion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Margaery Tyrell began to sob, and Tyrion heard her mother Lady Alerie
  saying, “He choked, sweetling. He choked on the pie. It was naught to
  do with you. He choked. We all saw.”</p>
  
  <p>“He did not choke.” Cersei’s voice was sharp as Ser Ilyn’s sword. “My
  son was poisoned.” She looked to the white knights standing helplessly
  around her. “Kingsguard, do your duty.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Joffrey is laid to rest at Great Sept of Baelor as evident from ASOS Chapter 67 (Jaime's POV):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>His son was dead, his father had disowned him, and his sister... she
  had not allowed him to be alone with her once, after that first day in
  the royal sept where Joffrey lay amongst the candles. <strong>Even when they
  bore him across the city to his tomb in the Great Sept of Baelor,
  Cersei kept a careful distance</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Books and Show do not differ in Joff's burial site, both state it to be Great Sept of Baelor. There is no evidence that Cersei ever intended to create a Zombie Joffrey like she created a zombie Ser Gregor.</p>

"203053","Do the GoT books also contain nudity?","<p>In the pilot episode of <em>Game of Thrones</em>, when I first saw a prostitute fully undressing in front of the Tyrion, I almost jumped because my mother had just walked past the TV. I proceeded to turn off the TV and swear to always take 18+ notification seriously (Initially, I had thought that 18+ meant extreme violence).</p>

<p>Well, I always wonder why producers and directors go for nudity. I believe everything could be made family friendly without sacrificing any content. For example, prostitutes could be shown from the back like lots of movies and TV shows show. Cersei's naked parade could also be properly depicted by only showing naked legs and upper breast.</p>

<p>Making the show family friendly could also increase the show's audience. Why was it necessary to include nudity in the show? Do the books also contain nudity rejecting which could undermine the show? Any words from producers or directors?</p>

<p>GRRM has spoken about the inclusion of nudity in the books and hence it extends to the show to a certain extent.

<p><strong>A.</strong> An artist has an obligation to tell the truth. My novels are epic fantasy, but they are inspired by and grounded in history. Rape and sexual violence have been a part of every war ever fought, from the ancient Sumerians to our present day. To omit them from a narrative centered on war and power would have been fundamentally false and dishonest, and would have undermined one of the themes of the books: that the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves. We are the monsters. (And the heroes too). Each of us has within himself the capacity for great good, and great evil.</p>

<p>We also have 'Valyria' for the location in Essos. While (in English) someone from Valyria is known as a 'Valyrian', 'Valyrian' and 'valar' are fairly similar words, so it seems at least possible that one came from the other, or have the same etymology (both in- and out- of world).</p>

<li><p>George is not a linguist</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The lack of language variation in Westeros was brought up -- lots of cultures, like the Dornish, the ironborn, the northmen -- but everyone speaks the common tongue. <strong>George admitted it wasn't very realistic, but he admitted he stole the idea from Tolkien.</strong> He admitted he could have more languages, but the books are in English and so he'd create more nonsense words to represent languages and then have to ""translate"" them anyway. He admitted it'd be more realistic to have seven or eight -- or even fourteen, or twenty-three -- languages, but also Tolkien was a genuine linguist, a brilliant one. He went through how many languages Tolkien made for LotR, and he says that sometimes he says when reading the books he just wants to strangle Tolkien because of how many great names he'd have, and <strong>how he could give the same thing four different names (in various languages) that all sounded great. He added that the vast majority of fantasists are in the same boat as him. Then he recounted the anecdote -- which he's recounted before -- of someone mistaking him for a Tolkien type and wanting his grammar and glossary and the like of Valyrian, and George admitting that Valyrian was seven words, and when he needs an eighth he'll make it then.</strong></p>

<p>Looking further we can see that of the known High Valyrian there are only five words, excluding nouns, with a possible sixth in the books: dracarys, valar, morghulis, dohaeris, valonqar and potentially maegi. Therefore, with 2 of these having the <em>""val""</em> start it is likely that this was a common start GRRM wanted to use: similar to the <em>""ae""</em> used commonly. As such it seems likely he just chose it cos valar sounds similar to Valyrian and sounds right.</p>

<p>With that said GRRM has been very open about his inspirations of which Tolkien is a massive one. For example, see this quote where he talks more about how much he's read Tolkien's works rather than his inspiration from him but this gives more of an idea of how much he's likely to be inspired from him whether consciously or otherwise:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GRRM: Well, you know there are a number of them. There is a lot of great fantasy out there. <strong>Of course, J.R.R. Tolkien, I think is the giant who looms above the entire realm of fantasy. I read Lord of the Rings when I was back in Junior High School still writing those stories for fanzines and it had a profound effect on me. I re-read it every few years, so obviously Tolkien would have to top any list of my own favorites.</strong> Another writer that I'm enormously in love with is Jack Vance, who I think is our greatest living Science Fiction and Fantasy author. Vance has written a lot more science fiction than fantasy but he exceeds at both realms. His Dying Earth, which [was] originally was published in the late 40s or early 50s, is a seminal work and he’s done some wonderful fantasy ever since. I read a Vance book the moment it comes out; anytime a new one comes I put down whatever I'm doing and go right to it. But there [is] also a lot of other good fantasy being done -- I could answer this question for a long, long time, but I think Tolkien and Vance would have to top any list of mine. They've been on top of my personal hit parade for decades now.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>As such it seems likely again that while Valyrian came first valar was probably chosen because it sounds right, is similar and is the same as <a href=""http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Valar"" rel=""noreferrer"">Valar</a> from Tolkien's works as you suggest. It's not unknown of for GRRM to slip in references here and there, for example, <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/156265/58193"">the Muppets</a> and I believe he's referenced football teams as well. So again it seems possible that the word came from Tolkien's works but no explicit mention is made.</p>

<p>I'm aware this probably isn't the answer you was looking for but I compiled a lot of research into this as to what we know and what answer it points to so worthwhile sharing it. I've also reached out to GRRM so if I ever get a response I'll update with a concrete answer.</p>

"138036","Why did Cersei ask for Ser Balman's help?","<p>In <em>A Feast For Crows</em> Chapter 24, We see Cersei having a dinner with Ser Balman Byrch and Falyse Stokeworth. Following conversation takes place:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“As I feared. Bronn is gathering swords for the dwarf. May the Seven
  save my little son. The Imp will kill him as he killed his brother.”
  She sobbed. “My friends, I put my honor in your hands... but what is a
  queen’s honor against a mother’s fears?”</p>
  
  <p>“Say on, Your Grace,” Ser Balman assured her. “Your words shall ne’er
  leave this room.”</p>
  
  <p>Cersei reached across the table and gave his hand a squeeze. “I... <strong>I
  would sleep more easily of a night if I were to hear that Ser Bronn
  had suffered a... a mishap</strong>... whilst hunting, perhaps.”</p>
  
  <p>Ser Balman considered a moment. “A mortal mishap?”</p>
  
  <p>No, I desire you to break his little toe. She had to bite her lip. My
  enemies are everywhere and my friends are fools. “I beg you, ser,” she
  whispered, “do not make me say it...”</p>
  
  <p>“I understand.” Ser Balman raised a finger.</p>
  
  <p>A turnip would have grasped it quicker. “You are a true knight indeed,
  ser. The answer to a frightened mother’s prayers.” Cersei kissed him.
  “<strong>Do it quickly, if you would. Bronn has only a few men about him
  now, but if we do not act, he will surely gather more.</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But why would she ask Ser Balman Byrch to kill Bronn?</p>

<p>At that time, Cersei was established as Tommen's regent and Lady of Casterly Rock. She could have formally charged Bronn of being accomplice in murder of Joffrey and send a contingent of Gold Cloaks/Red Cloaks to arrest Bronn with orders to kill him if he resists. Castle Stokeworth is right next to King's Landing so a mounted force could have traveled to Stokeworth and arrested Ser Bronn before the day's end. Then she could have executed him after a show trial. </p>

<p>Nobody would be expected to shed a tear for Bronn as Bronn's only aristocratic link was Lady Tanda Stokeworth, Falyse was heir to Lady Tanda and Stokeworths appeared to think that Bronn was insolent. </p>

<p>But Cersei instead turns to Ser Balman who mucks it all up, gets killed himself and gets poor Lady Tanda killed as well eventually.</p>

<p>Why would she ask Ser Balman to kill Bronn instead of using her authority as regent to dispense justice and govern in King's name? Why choose a riskier way instead of using a surer, safer way to eliminate a potential threat?</p>

<p>Even if Bronn asked for a trial by combat, Cersei commanded swords of puissant warriors like Ser Addam Marbrand and Ser Loras Tyrell. Ser Addam might have refused to take the part but Ser Loras could not refuse a royal command seeing as he was King's Guard and thus was sworn to obey any commands coming from a Royal provided they do not impact his first-most allegiance to the King.</p>

<p>Not to mention, given Cersei's attempt to get Loras killed by sending him to Dragonstone, She should be delighted to send Loras against Bronn because then she would be in a win-win situation. Cersei could even execute Bronn on spot and then let it be known that he refused a command issued in King's name thus proving his treason. </p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><plot-device>","138038","<p><strong>Bronn may have won a trial.</strong></p>

<p>Cersei may have been able to do what you say and put on a show of a trial, however, Bronn is now a member of House Stokeworth. He would be able to demand a trial-by-combat.</p>

<p>Bronn would have a good shot a winning the trial this way (and let's not forget, has a history of doing just that). With the Mountain not being the man he once was, Cersei would have a pick a more ""normal"" champion. </p>

<p>It seems to be Cersei's <em>modus operandi</em>  to take care of her problems out of the public eye and in a way that could not be linked back to her (after all she had King Robert taken care of in a similar way). She may have believed this way had a better chance at success if done properly.</p>

"138562","How does Varys explain his failure to save Rhaenys?","<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Massive spoilers ahead for those who haven't read <em>A Dance With Dragons</em>. Don't proceed if you do not wish to be spoiled. </p>

<hr>

<p>In <em>A Dance With Dragons</em> Epilogue, we see the following conversation between Kevan Lannister and Varys:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Aegon?"" For a moment he did not understand. Then he remembered. A
  babe swaddled in a crimson cloak, the cloth stained with his blood and
  brains. </p>
  
  <p>""Dead. He's dead.""</p>
  
  <p>""No."" The eunuch's voice seemed deeper. ""He is here.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before that, Aegon explains to Tyrion how he escaped King's Landing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A true friend, our Lord Connington. He must be, to remain so fiercely
  loyal to the grandson of the king who took his lands and titles and
  sent him into exile. A pity about that. Elsewise Prince Rhaegar’s
  friend might have been on hand when my father sacked King’s Landing,
  to save Prince Rhaegar’s precious little son from getting his royal
  brains dashed out against a wall.”</p>
  
  <p>The lad flushed. “That was not me. I told you. <strong>That was some
  tanner’s son from Pisswater Bend whose mother died birthing him. His
  father sold him to Lord Varys for a jug of Arbor gold</strong>. He had other
  sons but had never tasted Arbor gold. Varys gave the Pisswater boy to
  my lady mother and carried me away.”</p>
  
  <p>“Aye.” Tyrion moved his elephants. “And when the pisswater prince was
  safely dead, <strong>the eunuch smuggled you across the narrow sea to his
  fat friend the cheesemonger, who hid you on a poleboat and found an
  exile lord willing to call himself your father</strong>. It does make for a
  splendid story, and the singers will make much of your escape once you
  take the Iron Throne … assuming that our fair Daenerys takes you for
  her consort.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course it makes a splendid story but then the question arises, Why couldn't Varys save Rhaenys as well? </p>

<p>Rhaenys was important because:</p>

<ol>
<li>She was Aegon's heir if any mishap was to befall their uncle Viserys (Targaryens prefer male succession in aftermath of Dance of Dragons. See succession of King Viserys II despite claims of sisters of King Baelor).</li>
<li>She was potential bride for Aegon. </li>
</ol>

<p>But yet, she was left to her fate, apparently while her younger brother was saved. </p>

<p>Finding a silver-haired babe is no small deed. Sure there are bound to be silver-haired bastards sired by Lyseni Sailors on Whores of King's Landing (Yet this boy was supposedly sold by his father, not mother) but Rhaenys had common hair and looks and would have been easier to be replaced with a body double as compared to the typical Targaryen Princeling Aegon. Yet there was no effort at all. </p>

<p>Princess Elia was with ""fake"" Aegon when Gregor Clegane broke into her room. So if Varys' story is correct, She must have been taken into confidence by the eunuch. How on earth did Varys manage to make a mother agree to leaving her one child to beasts like Amory Lorch while saving the other? It is clear nevertheless, Varys never made any substantial effort to save the princess as well, if he made any efforts at all. </p>

<p>How does Varys explain that? Does he ever?<sup>1</sup> Because I don't remember anything like Varys talking about Princess Rhaenys except the little speech he gave to Eddard Stark regarding her murder and her kitten. Then of course there are other indicators, suggesting that <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/131317/54887"">Varys may have been lying altogether (Linked post contains similar level of spoilers)</a>. </p>

<p>It is just very disconcerting that no one, be it Tyrion, Jon Connington or Aegon himself raises this question that why couldn't Rhaenys be saved as well? </p>

<hr>

<p><sub>1. If he doesn't, <em>We Do not Know yet</em> is a perfectly valid answer until we do. </sub></p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","138572","<p>There's a plethora of reasons that Varys could have said to convince people that Rhaenys wasn't able to be saved. I don't think there is canon evidence for the reasoning he may have given, but we can speculate:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>She wasn't as important</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>As you said in the question, male heirs are preferred over their female counterparts. Whilst ensuring that Aegon would have had a relative to wed to keep the bloodline pure, that probably wasn't a priority when the possibility of having their entire family wiped out was upon them.</p>

<p>This means that he may have just expended more effort in rescuing Aegon than Rhaenys, and she was collateral damage in order to make the deception more believable. Having the corpse of one child would make everyone else more likely to believe that the other is also who they were supposed to be, and people wouldn't look as closely at the baby to make sure it was the right child.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>He tried, but couldn't save her</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Ned was captured and Sansa was taken hostage in aGoT, yet Arya managed to escape. Similarly, Varys may have had a plan to rescue them both firmly in place, along with replicas, yet when the time came he wasn't able to get to Rhaenys and decided to not risk Aegon's life in order to look for her.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>He couldn't find a replacement</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>He says he bought a baby from a man in exchange for wine, as the guy had other sons, but how many people would give up their (8 year old?) child for such a fee, or for anything? If they raised her for that long, it's unlikely that they would give her up to an unknown fate.</p>

<p>It would have been much more difficult to find a replacement child for her than for a baby, particularly one who looks convincingly enough like her to hold up to scrutiny. She would have been at court for years, so many lords would know her face, as opposed to a newborn that most people wouldn't recognize.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>It was harder to conceal a child than a baby</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Carrying around a baby, as long as it doesn't cry, can be hidden quite easily under a large cloak (a disguise Varys makes use of on several occasions). It would be trivial to get Aegon out of the city without anyone paying attention to Varys, and also smuggling the replacement in.</p>

<p>However, it would be much more difficult to smuggle out a young girl, particularly if his deception was revealed and people were looking for the escapees. In addition, he would have had to have found a way to get a young girl into the castle without arousing suspicion before taking a different one out without anybody asking questions. If there was any hint of such things happening and he was caught, they would all have been killed.</p>

<p>We don’t know because we see nothing of Jon after the stabbing and murder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jon fell to his knees. He found the dagger's hilt and wrenched it free. In the cold night air the wound was smoking. &quot;Ghost,&quot; he whispered. Pain washed over him. Stick them with the pointy end. When the third dagger took him between the shoulder blades, he gave a grunt and fell face-first into the snow. He never felt the fourth knife. Only the cold...</p>

<p>That is the last paragraph of the last chapter we have of a perspective at the Wall so we don't know anything that happens afterwards just yet.</p>
<h1><em>Game of Thrones</em></h1>
<p>The last we see of Jon in Season 5 is him dying in a puddle of his own blood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The brothers retreat, leaving Jon to die alone on the ground, bleeding out. The light goes out of his open eyes as we fade on Season 5.</em></p>

<p>Season 6 then opens with Davos spotting Jon’s body in the snow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>EXT. CASTLE BLACK - NIGHT</strong></p>
<p><em>Pan down from the inside of The Wall towards Castle Black. GHOST is howling. Slow zoom to JON SNOW's body, lying in the snow. A sign with the word &quot;TRAITOR&quot; is posted on a beam behind him. Closeup on JON SNOW. He is staring upwards, lifelessly. GHOST howls louder and pushes against the door to his pen.</em></p>
<p><strong>CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - DAVOS' CHAMBER</strong></p>
<p><em>DAVOS hears GHOST's howling and exits, then peers across the courtyard and sees JON SNOW's body. He immediately runs down the steps. He slows as he approaches JON SNOW's body. Other brothers of the Night's Watch approach. DAVOS kneels beside JON SNOW's body.</em></p>
<p><strong>NIGHT'S WATCHMAN:</strong> It's the Lord Commander!</p>
<p><em>DOLOROUS EDD and other Night's Watchmen rush up behind DAVOS.</em></p>
<p><strong>DAVOS:</strong> Help me get him inside.</p>
<p><em>The other Night's Watch brothers pick up JON SNOW's body and carry it away. DAVOS remains, staring at the left over pool of blood.</em></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Whilst we don’t know for sure why Thorne and the others left Jon's body there we can speculate on the following.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To send a message to the others that anyone else that goes against what they want will be killed too.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To hide that it was them, whilst it obviously was them, not being caught at the scene could help their case if they needed to defend themselves later on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although of course considering he openly admits it later on so he can bend the other Brothers to his way of thinking it is almost certainly done to send a message. He needs the other brothers to understand what happened and why it happened so they can come into his line of thinking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>ALLISER THORNE:</strong> We’ve committed treason, all of us. Jon Snow was my Lord Commander. I had no love for him. That was no secret. But I never once disobeyed an order. Loyalty is the foundation on which the Night’s Watch is built, and the Watch means everything to me. I have given my life, we have all given our lives to the Night’s Watch. Jon Snow was going to destroy the Night’s Watch. He let the wildlings through our gates, as no Lord Commander has ever done before. He gave them the very land on which they reaved and raped and murdered. Lord Commander Snow did what he thought was right, I’ve no doubt about that. And what he thought was right would have been the end of us. He thrust a terrible choice upon us, and we made it.</p>

<p>Or they may have been going to actually get some firewood to burn him, we simply don't have enough information on the time frame from them killing him to Davos finding him. Of course considering the above this seems unlikely.</p>

"205101","Does the Citadel charge tuition?","<p>I'm currently reading book 2 of <em>The Kingkiller Chronicle</em>, and the series' main character Kvothe spends a lot of time worrying about the cost of tuition at the University.  And while there are a lot of similarities between the University and <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>'s Citadel, I don't remember anyone even mentioning tuition.  This is especially surprising since the cost of a maester's chain is not trivial-- the metals used to forge one might include silver, gold, and even Valyrian steel.</p>

<p>Does the Citadel in Oldtown charge tuition to educate a student or to grant the title of maester?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","205103","<h1>No mention is made of a tuition and I doubt there is one</h1>
<p>Novices can come from anywhere and any background it seems likely that there isn't a fee. For example, Pate was a baseborn who joined the Citadel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>What I would like to know; -What are the criterions for being allowed into the Citadel for maester education? Could a dwarf in his late twenties like Tyrion be allowed in?</em></p>
<p>You'll learn more about the Citadel in future books.</p>
<p>In brief, however, there's no age requirement... nor any other sort of requirement, actually. The Citadel is very loosely structured, <strong>and open to all.</strong> That doesn't mean that all become maesters, however. Oldtown is full of aging novices and acolytes who have never finished forging their chain (or in some cases, never begun)... the Seven Kingdoms equivilent to the eternal grad student of our world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A penny will serve. For a silver stag Lorcas will carry you up to the Seneschal on his back. He has been fifty years an acolyte. He hates novices, particularly novices of noble birth.&quot;</p>
<p><sub><em>A Feast for Crows</em>, Samwell V</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Citadel is also funded by Oldtown and Lords who have Maesters in their employment so it might be that they don't need tuition to be able to teach people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How does the Citadel get financed? Lords pay for the service of the Maesters and the Citadel collects some of the revenue of Oldtown via taxes.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>And Acolytes can even be hired to write and read letters for extra funding for the Citadel.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The gates of the Citadel were flanked by a pair of towering green sphinxes with the bodies of lions, the wings of eagles, and the tails of serpents. One had a man's face, one a woman's. Just beyond stood Scribe's Hearth, <strong>where Oldtowners came in search of acolytes to write their wills and read their letters.</strong> Half a dozen bored scribes sat in open stalls, waiting for some custom. At other stalls books were being bought and sold. Sam stopped at one that offered maps, and looked over a hand-drawn map of Citadel to ascertain the shortest way to the Seneschal's Court.</p>
<p><sub><em>A Feast for Crows</em>, Samwell V</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's also worth mentioning that Novices and Acolytes spend years of their lives forging their chains and masters of their subjects.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alleras would make a maester. He had only been at the Citadel for a year, yet already he had forged three links of his maester's chain. Armen might have more, but each of his had taken him a year to earn. Still, he would make a maester too. Roone and Mollander remained pink-necked novices, but Roone was very young and Mollander preferred drinking to reading.</p>
<p><sub><em>A Feast for Crows</em>, Prologue</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a lot of commitment and after all the order is there to serve the realm and they need people from the realm to be able to do as such. Maesters, similarly to the Brothers of the Night's Watch, then swear oath's of celibacy, renouncing family and lands and whatnot so again there is a lot of commitment.</p>
<p>In short as the Citadel is funded from external sources and anyone can join so a tuition fee seems extremely unlikely.</p>
