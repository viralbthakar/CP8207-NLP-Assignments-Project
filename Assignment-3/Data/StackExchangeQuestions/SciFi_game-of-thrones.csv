"205669","Why did Tywin never remarry?","<p>With all of Tywin Lannister's talk of protecting the family legacy why did he never remarry after the death of his wife? He was still relatively young at the time and there are examples of older lords taking new brides.</p>

<p>It seems odd that he wouldn't try for more children seeing as he believes only Jaime is a suitable heir to Casterly Rock. It may be that he didn't want to create alternate claimants to the Rock but that seems like weak reasoning. Especially considering how he sought to wed Cersei to Loras intending, in part, for her to have more children.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","205670","<p>George R.R. Martin answered this question in correspondence with a fan.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> And lastly, why didn't Lord Tywin ever remarry after his wife died?

<p>You have to know the background of Tywin's marital life to understand why he may not have wanted to remarry. </p>

<p>Tywin married his cousin Joanna Lannister even though such a marriage brought no political advantages to House Lannister. Why? Because he loved her. He never loved anything more than her. Given <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/128378/54887"">his childhood and formative years</a>, Tywin had grown to despise laughter and viewed it with suspicion. Yet he laughed with Lady Joanna, her and her alone. It was often said at the court that Lord Tywin might rule the seven Kingdoms (As Aerys' Hand) but it was Lady Joanna who ruled him. The last joy went out of Tywin with Joanna's last breath and he never so much as smiled again. </p>

<p>Tywin already had three children so he didn't need to remarry to sire heirs. Even if he hadn't had children, House Lannister survived through his brothers. So getting more children was probably not a huge concern for him, especially since <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/129605/54887"">childbirth had cost him the love of his life</a>. So in short, he never moved on from Joanna and he simply had no wish to remarry at all. </p>

<p>Of course he was no stranger to whores after Joanna's death (Shae's one example). There are theories among the fandom that the secret tunnel from Tower of the Hand to Chataya's brothel may have been dug on Tywin's orders, allowing him to visit whores in secrecy. Given how he despised whores and those who frequented them, publicly, he could hardly become a patron openly. But it seems all that was limited to physical base needs, not because he ever wanted to have a woman again in his life.</p>

"66003","Was A Song of Ice and Fire inspired by Chinese History, and if yes, to what extent?","<p>I have noticed a few striking parallels between China's history and George R. R. Martin's epic fantasy, ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Ice Wall resembles the Great Wall of China. Both are meant to keep out the ""outsiders""</li>
<li>The Chinese tended to view themselves as the center of the world, and view the others as uncivilized and barbarians. In the same way the people from the Seven Kingdoms in the series view everything outside the Wall as ""the Others"". </li>
<li>Seven Kingdoms fighting among one another for the Iron Throne, this closely resembles the Seven Kingdom in China during <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_and_Autumn_period"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Spring and Autumn period</a>. </li>
<li>Dragonstone. In the series, ""<a href=""http://www.bustle.com/articles/23255-china-heavily-censored-game-of-thrones-this-might-be-why"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">We learn that the Targaryens once ruled all of Westeros until a rebellion, punctuated by a few hideous slaughters, chased them to a small, craggy isle off the coast called Dragonstone</a>"" This description reminds me of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Kuomintang#1945.E2.80.9349"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kuomingtang's retreat to Taiwan</a> in 1949.</li>
</ol>

<p>My question is, to what extent A Song of Ice and Fire was (and is) inspired by Chinese History?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","66005","<ol>
<li><p>The idea of the Wall was inspired <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian%27s_Wall"" rel=""nofollow"">Hadrian's Wall</a>, but resembles a lot the Great Wall of China.</p></li>
<li><p>I think a lot of ancient civilizations believed that they were the center of the world. For instance, this also happened in ancient Greece. They thought that everyone else was a barbarian. The word 'barbarian' comes from the Greek word 'Βάρβαρος' (pronounced 'varvaros') ; people couldn't understand what others were saying, and every word sounded like 'βαρ βαρ' (pronc: 'var var'), thus βάρβαρος.</p></li>
<li><p>George Martin was inspired for his novels by the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_the_Roses"" rel=""nofollow"">War of the Roses</a> as well as by the Hundred Years' War, the Crusades and the Albigensian Crusade. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire#Writing_process"" rel=""nofollow"">""Interview: George Martin"".</a> Deep Magic 41: 19–21. 2005.)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I don't know anything about the 4th point you mention</p>

<p>So, my conclusion would be that <strong>no, A song of ice and fire has not been inspired by the Chinese History</strong>. Most of Martin's influences are from European history, but I don't believe that that restricted him not to influence from other histories around the globe. So far though, that's all we have been told.</p>

"66029","What is the meaning of ""The seed is strong""?","<p>In ASOIAF, Jon Arryn repeated several times while dying, &quot;The seed is strong&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Eddard</strong>: &quot;Was there nothing else? No final word?</p>
<p><strong>Pycelle</strong>: &quot;When I saw that all hope had fled, I gave the Hand milk of the poppy [...] He whispered something to the king and his lady wife, a blessing for his son. <em>The seed is strong,</em> he said. At the end the speech was too slurred to comprehend. Death did not come until the next morning, but Lord Jon was at peace after that. He never spoke again.&quot;</p>
<p><sub><em>A Game of Thrones</em>, Eddard V</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But so far (I have read all the books), it doesn't seem to me that he was talking about sickly Robert. <strong>But who else? What is the evidence that he was/wasn't talking about his son?</strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","66035","<p>The clear implication made in the books is that when Jon Arryn, Hand of the King, said &quot;The seed is strong&quot; he was referring to the indications - based on documented bloodlines and inherited genetic characteristics - that Robert Baratheon did not father Joffrey, Tommen, or Myrcella on Cersei Lannister.</p>
<p>(Of course, in Westeros, no one would think of them as &quot;genetic characteristics&quot;.  But the inherited traits which we know to be genetics have long been recognized as having a bloodline relationship - more so, frankly, in systems where nobility intermarries and documents their births and marriages better than is the average.  And seed is slang for sperm, which leads to births, or so I'm led to believe...)</p>
<p>As for <strong>evidence</strong>:</p>
<p>Lysa Arryn remembering:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jon knew.  <em>The seed is strong</em>, he told me.  His last words.  He kept saying Robert's name, and he grabbed my arm so hard he left marks.  <em>Tell them, the seed is strong</em></p>
<p><sub><em>A Game of Thrones</em>, Catelyn VI</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She goes on to interpret it as &quot;[Jon's] seed.  He wanted everyone to know what a good strong boy my baby was going to be.&quot;  But she's an idiot (that's clearly established in the books).  Robert is the name of both her son and the King.  He was trying to get a message out, she was hearing what she wanted to.</p>
<p>Ned confronted Cersei when he figured it out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;All three are Jaime's,&quot; he said.  It was not a question.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank the gods.&quot;</p>
<p><em>The seed is strong</em>, Jon Arryn had cried on his deathbed, and
so it was.  All those bastards, all with hair as black as night.
Grand Maester Malleon recorded the last mating between stag and lion,
some ninety years ago,... Their only issue, an unnamed boy described
in Malleon's tome as a <em>large and lusty lad boar with a full head of
black hair.</em> ... No matter how far back Ned searched in the brittle
yellowed pages, always he found the gold yielding before the coal.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Since we know that</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>Jon Snow is now the son of Rhaegar (HBO final episode), </p>
</blockquote>

<p>won't he get the push to be the new King with Daenerys as his queen? Wouldn't that solve all the lineage issues, claims to the throne, and unify everything? </p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><adaptation-comparison>","139471","<p>The books and the show have diverged pretty far, especially when it comes to Aegon Targaryen, and will likely never match up.</p>

<p>As far as we know, Aegon Targaryen is <em>not</em> alive in the show -- we've seen no hint that he is hiding anywhere, and Varys has always openly supported Daenerys . This is most obvious in the last few episodes of Season 6. The entire plot thread where Tyrion meets Aegon was skipped completely, and Dany, not Aegon, is about to make landfall on Westeros with an army.</p>

<p>In the books, on the other hand, Aegon Targaryen is still alive, and he has a <em>more</em> legitimate claim to the throne. He's also already in Westeros, and the people in King's Landing (well, Kevan at least) are aware of him and suspect he might be telling the truth. </p>

<p>There's no way that Aegon and Jon can be the ""same"" character, for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the books, Jon Snow is almost exactly the same person as on the show. It's fully expected that his parents will be revealed to be Rhaegar and Lyanna Stark. In the books, Aegon is the son of Rhaegar and Elia Martell, a true born son that has since gone into hiding. Both are alive at the same time.</li>
<li>In the show, Jon Snow has not been given <em>any</em> of Aegon's character or plot development. Aegon was thought killed, secretly hidden, and grew up in Essos fully knowing who he was. Jon's story in the books is basically the same as his story in the show.</li>
<li>In the books, Varys has been secretly supporting Aegon since his birth, and done everything he can to get Aegon back on the throne. In the show, all of that plot development was given to <em>Dany</em>, not Jon.</li>
<li>As far as the lineage issue goes: Jon Snow is a bastard; he has no claim to the Iron Throne regardless of which family sits on it, unless the <em>existing</em> King legitimizes him. His claim to the Throne of the North was given to him not because he inherited it, but because the Lords of the North merely declared him King by fiat. That's not going to give him a claim to the Seven Kingdoms in any case.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's no indication that the books are going to ""sync up"" to the show in this regard. It would be near impossible to take the story arc that Aegon has been following and somehow ""merge"" it with Jon's at this point. Most likely, the show is simply going to ignore everything about the Aegon plot and go their own way. (It's also possibly -- indeed, in this series, likely -- that Aegon just outright dies and the whole problem goes away. We'll find out eventually.)</p>
"
"139483","Why are Stannis and Renly never referred to as ""Prince""?","<p>It seems that almost any direct male relation to a King will be given the honor of being called Prince. </p>

<p>Easy examples, Joffrey and Tommen are the sons of King Robert</p>

<p>Harder example, Bran and Rickon are the brothers of the ""King"" in the North.</p>

<p>Holdover example, Doran is ruler of Dorne and were allowed to maintain the Prince titles after they were not conquered by the dragons. We also see again that a brother, Oberyn, is given the title as well. </p>

<p>The same is true for females (for once!). Myrcella is called a Princess as she is the daughter of King Robert. Shireen like wise is called as her father is claiming to be king.</p>

<p>So we can confirm that <em>brothers</em> of a King will be called ""Prince"". However, we never see Stannis and Renly given this title (before the death of Robert). </p>

<p>Is there any reasoning for this? Did their positions as Lords of Dragonstone and Storms End and as members of the Small Council somehow ""out rank"" their status as princes? </p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><names>","139488","<p>For Bran and Rickon, it's worth noting that both are Robb's heirs. Renly and Stannis are not. It may simply  be the case that they were once called princes, but became ""Lords"" when Robert had children. </p>

<p>In Stannis' case, it may also be to avoid the awkwardness in calling him ""the Prince of Dragonstone,"" a title that historically implied that he would be the heir. Likewise, in Renly's case his primary duty was as Lord Paramount of the Stormlands. Both are also on the Small Council, whose members are called ""lord.""</p>

<p>Which brings me to an important point: more so than the Targaryens princes ever were, Stannis and Renly are lords in their own right rather than just a part of the royal family. Under the Targaryens, principality over Dragonstone and Summerhall was never seen as lordships. They were properties belonging to the crown that were traditionally granted as a seat for royal Targs and could be given and retracted at the crown's whim.</p>

<p>But Robert didn't give Renly and Stannis principality over Dragonstone and the Stormlands, he gave it to them as <em>lordships</em>. Renly's sons would inherit Storm's End after him, Stannis's sons would inherit Dragonstone, etc. each creating cadet branches of the main family. To hammer in this distinction, I wouldn't be surprised if it were the Baratheon bros themselves who insisted on going by Lord.</p>

"66178","How did Eddard Know the True Parentage of Joffrey, Tommen and Myrcella?","<p>I get that the dark-haired seed is strong and we can infer that the three Baratheon-Lannister children are not Robert's. But how did Eddard correctly guess that the real father was Jaime, and not some other random guy that Cersei was with?</p>

<p>Bran could have been pushed out of the window with that knowledge also. Isn't it also possible that the golden-haired seed is stronger in comparison to another gene, due to which the children were blond?</p>

<p>Finally, the Queen's brother is the last person anyone would expect her to have an affair with. So what did I miss that points the finger at Jaime Lannister?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","66180","<p>After the assassination attempt, it seemed obvious that Bran was pushed because he knew/saw something that he shouldn't have. Once it was clear that Cersei was cheating on Robert and bearing another man's children, it'd be a pretty good guess that Bran caught them in the act.</p>

<p>So from there, Eddard would only need to consider every member of King Robert's retinue who visited Winterfell. All of the adult noble men left Winterfell with the king and Eddard to go hunting during the hours that Bran was pushed... except for Jaime, who stayed behind to protect the queen. Jaime, who had previously shown himself capable of dishonorable violence. Jaime, his sister's stalwart defender. Jaime, who would have been in close proximity with the queen during the time of all three conceptions.</p>

<p>Couple that with how overwhelmingly all three Baratheon children had the Lannister look, and I don't think it's that hard of a conclusion to draw.</p>

<p>Also keep in mind, Eddard summons Cersei to the garden because he has discovered ""the truth that Jon Arryn died for."" Cersei is the one who starts talking about how Jaime would have killed Robert if he knew he hit her. It's <em>that</em> comment that leads Eddard to say, ""Your brother... or your lover?"" So it may be that Eddard summoned Cersei knowing that the kids weren't Robert's, but only suspecting that Jaime was the father. Cersei assumed Eddard knew everything, and basically telegraphed that they were lovers.</p>

"139747","How did Jon Arryn actually find out about ""the strong seed""?","<p>Everybody suspects Jon Arryn was killed by doings of House Lannister, because he was close to finding evidence that </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> King Robert's children were not actually his.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Unmarked spoilers beyond this point.)</p>

<p>Later we find out that House Lannister had nothing to do with Jon Arryn's death and it was Littlefinger all along and everything about Jon Arryn's last days and death was tailored to suit Littlefinger's goals.</p>

<p>Do we know preceisely how Jon Arryn found out about ""the strong seed"" in Robert's family? </p>

<p>I am wondering if he actually investigated and learned or whether Littlefinger simply told him. Basically I am looking for evidence for a shortcut to tie everything bad that happend to Littlefinger without any complex theories.</p>

<p>Hasn't anybody ever cared why and how Jon started his investigations? 
It is intuitive that Stannis would look for something like this to claim the throne is, but why Jon Arryn? Why would he look to act against the marriage of King Baratheon whom he helped to win the Iron Throne alongside the Lannisters?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","139748","<h1>Books' Perspective</h1>
<h3>Who was responsible for commencement Jon Arryn's investigation?</h3>
<p>It was Lord Stannis who suspected something wrong in physical features of his nephews and niece first and brought his suspicions to Jon Arryn, which lead to their investigation about parentage of the three princelings.</p>
<p>As Stannis explained to Catelyn in <em>A Clash of Kings</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Lord Stannis,&quot; she asked, &quot;if you knew the queen to be guilty of such
monstrous crimes, why did you keep silent? &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I did not keep silent,&quot; Stannis declared. &quot;<strong>I brought my suspicions to</strong>
<strong>Jon Arryn</strong>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he explains why he came to Jon Arryn with his suspicions rather than Robert himself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Rather than your own brother?”<br><br>
“My brother’s regard for me was never more than dutiful,” said
Stannis. “From me, such accusations would have seemed peevish and
selfserving, a means of placing myself first in the line of
succession. <strong>I believed Robert would be more disposed to listen if
the charges came from Lord Arryn</strong>, whom he loved.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jon Arryn had no idea or suspicions prior to Lord Stannis coming to him with his suspicion. Or at least, nothing suggests that he in fact had any suspicions before Stannis approached him.</p>
<h3>The investigation</h3>
<p>Jon Arryn and Stannis Baratheon worked closely to investigate the apparent lack of Baratheon features in Cersei's children. And at first Jon began by obtaining <em>the Lineage of Great Houses</em> from Grand Maester and observing animal breeding to understand how genetic traits were passed from parents to off-spring.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Carrots and apples,&quot; Ned repeated. It sounded as if this boy would be even less use than the others. And he was the last of the four Littlefinger had turned up. Jory had spoken to each of them in turn. Ser Hugh had been brusque and uninformative, and arrogant as only a new-made knight can be. If the Hand wished to talk to him, he should be pleased to receive him, but he would not be questioned by a mere captain of guards … even if said captain was ten years older and a hundred times the swordsman. The serving girl had at least been pleasant. She said <strong>Lord Jon had been reading more than was good for him</strong>, that he was troubled and melancholy over his young son's frailty, and gruff with his lady wife. The potboy, now cordwainer, had never exchanged so much as a word with Lord Jon, but he was full of oddments of kitchen gossip: the lord had been quarreling with the king, the lord only picked at his food, the lord was sending his boy to be fostered on Dragonstone, <strong>the lord had taken a great interest in the breeding of hunting hounds</strong>, the <strong>lord had visited a master armorer to commission a new suit of plate, wrought all in pale silver with a blue jasper falcon and a mother-of-pearl moon on the breast. The king's own brother had gone with him to help choose the design, the potboy said. No, not Lord Renly, the other one, Lord Stannis.</strong><br><sub>A Game of Thrones - Eddard VI</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evidently whatever they found during their reading and observations was suspicious enough so they started seeking out natural born Children of Robert Baratheon. The information however didn't mean much for Eddard since he didn't understand much of it particularly the visit to Tobho Mott to see Gendry on pretext of commissioning a new armour.</p>
<p>From <em>A Game of Thrones</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The lad swears Lord Jon was as strong as a man half his age. Often
went riding with Lord Stannis, he says.”</p>
<p><strong>Stannis again, Ned thought</strong>. He found that curious. <strong>Jon Arryn and he had been cordial, but never friendly</strong>. And while Robert had been
riding north to Winterfell, Stannis had removed himself to
Dragonstone, the Targaryen island fastness he had conquered in his
brother’s name. He had given no word as to when he might return.
“Where did they go on these rides?” Ned asked.</p>
<p><strong>“The boy says that they visited a brothel.”</strong></p>
<p>“A brothel?” Ned said. “The Lord of the Eyrie and Hand of the King
visited a brothel with Stannis Baratheon?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They had gone to that brothel to see Barra, Robert's daughter. Despite the mother having light colored hair, the daughter had inherited Baratheon black locks which confirmed some of their suspicions.</p>
<p>Then Ned went to the armourer Jon Arryn and Stannis Baratheon went to together.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ned smiled. “Did you make a falcon helm for Lord Arryn?”</p>
<p>Tobho Mott paused a long moment and set aside his wine. “<strong>The Hand
did call upon me, with Lord Stannis, the king’s brother</strong>. I regret to
say, they did not honor me with their patronage.”</p>
<p>Ned looked at the man evenly, saying nothing, waiting. He had found
over the years that silence sometimes yielded more than questions. And
so it was this time.</p>
<p>“<strong>They asked to see the boy</strong>,” the armorer said, “so I took them
back to the forge.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There they found out Gendry, whose mother was a blonde yet the boy had Baratheon Black hair and blue eyes. This further cemented their suspicions.</p>
<p>Not to mention, Stannis knew that Robert's bastard Edric Storm who was sired on Delena Florent also had black hair and blue eyes. He sent the child to Storm's End after the birth. Jon Arryn plausibly knew<sup>1</sup> about the bastard daughter Robert had fathered when he was a ward of Lord Arryn at Eyrie. That Girl, Mya Stone also had black hair and blue eyes.</p>
<p>The final thing that confirmed their doubts was what they found out in a book about lineage of Great Houses which recorded marriages and births.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“One thing,” Ned told him. “<strong>I should be curious to examine the book
that you lent Jon</strong> the day before he fell ill.”</p>
<p>“I fear you would find it of little interest,” Pycelle said. “<strong>It was
a ponderous tome by Grand Maester Malleon on the lineages of the great
houses</strong>.”</p>
<p>“Still, I should like to see it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There, Lord Arryn found out that every time a Baratheon married a Lannister, Black hair genes won against Golden hair genes. This was the final proof they needed. As Eddard Stark later found out for himself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The seed is strong, Jon Arryn had cried on his deathbed, and so it
was. <strong>All those bastards, all with hair as black as night</strong>. Grand
Maester Malleon recorded the last mating between stag and lion, some
ninety years ago, when <strong>Tya Lannister wed Gowen Baratheon</strong>, third
son of the reigning lord. Their only issue, an unnamed boy described
in Malleon’s tome as a large and lusty lad <strong>born with a full head of
black hair</strong>, died in infancy.</p>
<p>Thirty years before that <strong>a male Lannister had taken a Baratheon
maid</strong> to wife. She had given him <strong>three daughters and a son, each
black- haired</strong>.</p>
<p>No matter how far back Ned searched in the brittle yellowed pages,
<strong>always he found the gold yielding before the coal</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Littlefinger's role</h3>
<p>In the same Book, Varys also said that Stannis had read the book and examined the physical features of Robert's bastards, although he mentions it in the wrong order as Stannis' own statements suggest that he was in fact the first person to suspect that, rather than the last.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;He accuses my brother and sister of incest. I wonder how he came by
that suspicion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Perhaps he read a book and looked at the color of a bastard's
hair</strong>, as Ned Stark did, and Jon Arryn before him. Or perhaps someone
whispered it in his ear.&quot; The eunuch's laugh was not his usual giggle,
but deeper and more throaty.</p>
<p>&quot;Someone like you, perchance?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Am I suspected? It was not me.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tyrion then asked Varys if it was not him, then who lead Stannis to his investigations and sowed the seeds of the suspicion. Varys subtly hinted that it may have been Littlefinger.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If you were not this whisperer, who was?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Some traitor, doubtless.&quot; Varys tightened the cinch.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Littlefinger?&quot;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&quot;I named no name.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice how Varys does not deny that it was Littlefinger but instead just insists that he named no one. Of course, <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/131317/54887"">Varys has his own motives</a> so everything he says can't be trusted.</p>
<p>So, it is possible that it was Littlefinger who made Lord Stannis suspicious about parentage of Cersei's children and therefore <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/139649/54887"">planned the war of the five Kings</a>.</p>
<h3>Will Stannis seek something to claim the throne for himself regardless?</h3>
<p>That would be against the very character of the man. He had no desire to claim the throne. But once he came to find out that he was actually the rightful heir, he was determined to win it because:</p>
<ol>
<li>He has an iron sense about laws. If something is his by law, he will never forfeit it. If something wasn't his by law, he would never claim it.</li>
<li>He had a duty to his daughter who was the rightful heir to the throne after him.</li>
<li>He believed he had to fight the war for survival of humanity even though he thought that this war will eventually kill him. But he was willing to pay that price for his people.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you see, the desire for the throne or greed rather, doesn't come into it.</p>
<p>To prove these points, see the following canon evidence.</p>
<p>Stannis said this to Davos in <em>A Storm of Swords</em>, when the latter asked him why did he want the throne:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>It is not a question of wanting</strong>. The throne is mine, as Robert's heir. <strong>That is law</strong>. After me, <strong>it must pass to my daughter</strong>,
unless Selyse should finally give me a son. I am king. <strong>Wants do not
enter into it. I have a duty to my daughter. To the realm</strong>. Even to
Robert. He loved me but little, I know, yet he was my brother. The
Lannister woman gave him horns and made a motley fool of him. She may
have murdered him as well, as she murdered Jon Arryn and Ned Stark.
For such crimes there must be justice. Starting with Cersei and her
abominations. But only starting. I mean to scour that court clean. As
Robert should have done after the Trident.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also explained that he was willing to pay the ultimate price as was his duty being King:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know the cost! Last night, gazing into that hearth, I saw things in
the flames as well. I saw a king, a crown of fire on his brows,
burning… burning, Davos. <strong>His own crown consumed his flesh &amp; turned
him into ash. Do you think I need Melisandre to tell me what that
means? Or you?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Cersei had given birth to even one Black-haired child<sup>2</sup>, Stannis probably would have never doubted anything. He was not looking for excuses to claim the throne.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>One thing is clear. It was Lord Stannis who started the investigations after taking Jon Arryn on board.</p>
<p>Another thing, which is unclear but is hinted, is that Littlefinger may have caused Lord Stannis to be suspicious in the first place.</p>
<hr />
<h1>Show's Perspective</h1>
<p>In the show, like many other key logical variables, this one is also missing.</p>
<p>It is implied that Stannis had no idea about the truth behind birth of Cersei's children and only learnt about it when Eddard Stark sent him a letter informing him about death of Robert and him being the heir.</p>
<p>From <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Stannis_Baratheon"" rel=""noreferrer"">Show Wiki</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stannis hosts a council and prepares a letter to be distributed
throughout the Seven Kingdoms. <strong>He has learned from Eddard Stark that
Joffrey Baratheon is a bastard</strong> born of incest between Cersei
Lannister and her brother Jaime rather than Robert Baratheon's true
heir.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Show does not give any hint that why did Jon Arryn begin his investigations except that he did and died as a consequence. There is no mention of liaison between Stannis and Jon Arryn in the show.</p>
<hr />
<p><sub><strong>1.</strong> Since whole Vale knew who Mya's father was, How could Lord of Vale not know that it was Robert, who was his own ward?</sub></p>
<p><sub><strong>2.</strong> In Books, Cersei never gave birth to any Black haired child or any child whose father may have been Robert. Show however, added a brief mention of a Child who died in infancy who may have been Robert's. Which begs the question that if that was the case, Why should have Jon Arryn suspected anything wrong at all? The suspicious thing was that none of the Princelings had Black hair. If there was one, it should have quelled the suspicions as suggested by Tyrion in the books.</sub></p>

<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/R%27hllor#Behind_the_Scenes"" rel=""noreferrer"">According to George R. R. Martin</a>, this religion's dualistic aspects of a good and an evil god are inspired by <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism"" rel=""noreferrer"">Zoroastrianism,</a> along with the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharism"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cathars</a> of Medieval Europe.</p>
<p>In <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTTW8M_etko"" rel=""noreferrer"">this interview</a> (at about 47:00 GRRM) talks about his inspirations for religion in his works. I have taken the relevant parts and transcribed them below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Host]</strong> Okay, so this next question is, 'In your books there are several religious systems such as The Seven, The Drowned God, The Faceless Men, The Old Gods, etc. How do you come up with such a detailed yet entirely distinct doctrines? Are there any that aren't detailed in the books?</p>
<p><strong>[GRRM]</strong> Well, yes. To start with the last part first, yes. There are many religions that are not detailed. You can see some of them in Arya's Bravos chapters where she visits, passes through the Island of the Gods and I throw in references to 17 different obscure religions that I'm probably never going to reveal in much detail.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The major religions that actually play a significant role in the story are somewhat based on real religions, or real religious systems. Although,I don't believe in just doing a one to one transformation where I'm going to take like Islam and file off the serial numbers and call it Mislam or something and pretend it's the same. I take certain tenants of the religions, but I maybe take part of this and part of that and I meld them together and I think about it and I add a few imaginative elements.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>And then you have the Red God, The Lord of Light, from across the sea which has a certain Zoroastrianism elements to it with the fire worship and so forth and the duality. And also a lot from the Albigensian Crusade, the Cathars, who were exterminated by the Catholics and the Great Albigensian Crusade. But they had a fundamental belief, a dualist religion, that there were two gods, a good god and an evil god, and the world that we live in was created by the evil god...</p>

<p>My question is: why wouldn't Cersei and Jaime try to kill Bran after realizing that he'd awaken after the fall? Weren't they afraid that he'd remember what happen and expose them?</p>

At that point Bran was being watched 24/7 by his mother, and both Jaime and Cersei are prominent royal guests. It may not have been possible for them to make suitable plans without exposing themselves. At that point the safer play may have been to just hit the road for King's Landing as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Also, by that point the Starks were suspicious about what happened since Bran had never fallen before, and Catelyn received a letter from Lysa blaming the Lannisters for Jon Arryn's death. Granted, Jaime and Cersei did not know about the extent of this, but it may have added to the tension at Winterfell. All the more reason for them to leave before the situation gets any worse.</p>

"140922","How does a raven get intercepted?","<p>In  “A Song of Ice and Fire”, there are many instances when some nobility sends a knight to deliver a sensitive message rather than send a raven, because a raven can get intercepted.  I have no problem believing that it is <em>possible</em> to intercept a raven, but I imagine that this must a rather rare event - how is it that raven interception is such a real threat?</p>

<p>Based on the explanation given <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/36871/how-does-raven-post-work"">here</a>, the majority of ravens are trained to return to a specific castle. If we assume that a raven would travel “as the crow flies” (i.e. in roughly a straight line), it is not clear to me how a raven would get close enough to another castle to be intercepted unless it deviates from its straight path. So I find it unlikely that they could be intercepted by flying to (or near) an incorrect castle. </p>

<p>Another possibility is that the “common folk” would shoot down a raven and bring the message to their lord for favor. For this to work, I imagine that either a message is large enough to be visible on a flying raven or that people try to shoot every raven they see in the hope of getting a messenger raven. I find the former unlikely due to weight ratios (they’re not swallows, after all), and if the latter were true I imagine that ravens would be rather rare due to overhunting, but I do not recall any mention of this.</p>

<p>Is there an in-universe explanation as to how raven post interception is likely enough to occur as to warrant sending knights instead?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","140928","<h1>By accident (usually)</h1>
<h2>People do sometimes prefer knights to ravens</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“The first time I saw Riverrun, I was a squire green as summer grass,”
Jaime told his cousin. “Old Sumner Crakehall sent me to deliver a
message, one he swore could not be entrusted to a raven. Lord Hoster
kept me for a fortnight whilst mulling his reply, and sat me beside
his daughter Lysa at every meal.”</p>
<p><sub>—<em>A Feast for Crows</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>However, they seem more worried about mishap than malice</h2>
<p>It certainly seems possible to shoot down ravens:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Unless Lord Frey tells him,” Catelyn said sharply. “Theon, when you
return to my uncle, tell him he is to place his best bowmen around the
Twins, day and night, with orders to bring down any raven they see
leaving the battlements. I want no birds bringing word of my son’s
movements to Lord Tywin.”</p>
<p><sub>—<em>A Game of Thrones</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And indeed, other people consider this a risk:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Catelyn knelt and took her father’s hand in hers. It was a big hand,
but fleshless now, the bones moving loosely under the skin, all the
strength gone from it. “You should have told me,” she said. “A rider,
a raven…”</p>
<p>“Riders are taken, questioned,” he answered. “Ravens are brought
down…”</p>
<p><sub>—<em>A Game of Thrones</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As to <em>when</em> someone would shoot down a raven in the hopes of getting a message, the answer is presumably if they are suspicious. If a raven flies over a battlefield, it might be shot down on suspicion of coming from the enemy. If a raven leaves a castle and there are spies  in a nearby village, it might be shot down. If someone sees a raven flying during an hour when they are not usually active, that could also be cause for suspicion.  The raven population will not be depleted, because only during certain times and places will it be worth the trouble to target any ravens one sees.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that <strong>this is not always (or perhaps usually) intentional</strong>, though. It seems likely more people shoot down ravens for food than for information:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ravens did not always win through. Some bowman could have brought the
bird down and roasted him for supper. The letter that would have set
her heart at ease might even now be lying by the ashes of some
campfire beside a pile of raven bones.</p>
<p><sub>—<em>A Storm of Swords</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Stannis spoke of the risks to his ravens, he counted storms and hawks among the dangers his ravens would face.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stannis turned to Davos. “The maester tells me that we have one
hundred seventeen ravens on hand. I mean to use them all. One hundred
seventeen ravens will carry one hundred seventeen copies of my letter
to every corner of the realm, from the Arbor to the Wall. Perhaps a
hundred will win through against storm and hawk and arrow.</p>
<p><sub>—<em>A Clash of Kings</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, as we see from the previous passage, ravens are frequently brought down merely out of hunger.</p>
<p>It seems there are two reasons not to entrust a sensitive message to a raven:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sensitive messages are usually important.</strong> If 14% of ravens fall victim to misadventure, then the message is lost quite frequently. A knight may be killed, but perhaps not nearly so often.</li>
<li><strong>Accidental interception would be the main worry.</strong> If some hunter shoots down a raven for a meal, they are bound to notice the message. And if they can read (or know someone who can) and have loose lips, the message could travel to the ears of those who could use it for harm.</li>

<p>But its how he cuts them off that's the kicker.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Ramsay would never simply cut off a man’s finger. He preferred to flay it and let the exposed flesh dry and crack and fester. Reek had been whipped and racked and cut, but there was no pain half so excruciating as the pain that followed flaying. It was the sort of pain that drove men mad, and it could not be endured for long. Soon or late the victim would scream, “Please, no more, no more, stop it hurting, cut it off,” and Lord Ramsay would oblige. (DwD, Reek 1)</p>

<p>See the second quote above.</p>

"141227","Why did Davos help Stannis during Robert's Rebellion?","<p>In the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Davos_Seaworth#History"">ASOIAF wiki</a>, it states that ""<em>almost a year into the siege of Storm's End, Davos took it upon himself to run the Redwyne blockade to smuggle onions and other foodstuffs into the castle</em>"".</p>

<p>If he took it upon himself to do this, then clearly no one commissioned him to help the besieged castle. Stannis himself states that during the siege he was all but forgotten about by his brother Robert and the other rebels, so this at least seems to be true. If I remember correctly he also never mentions in any of his chapters that anyone had asked him to help Storm's End.</p>

<p>But why would Davos risk death to help Stannis without any prior incentive?</p>

<p>The only thing that I can think of is gold, but Davos doesn't ever appear to be a particularly greedy man. He also seems to be constantly susprised by the fact that he was raised to knighthood, so again I find it hard to believe that he decided to take such a massive risk for that reason specifically. Every other Lord also appears to be surprised that Stannis decided to do this, so obviously it seems like a much greater reward than would have been expected.</p>

<p>In addition, if no one had asked Davos to smuggle food into the castle, how did he know they were in such a bad way as to require the food he brought? It was probably well known across the kingdom that Storm's End was under siege, but it could have been possible that they had food reserves to last longer than the year in which they held the castle. In which case, how would he even have been sure that he was going to get a reward at all for his actions?</p>

<p><strong>Is there any indication on what Davos' motivation for smuggling food into Storm's End was?</strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","141230","<p>""Taking it upon himself"" does not rule out money changing hands.</p>

<p>Davos is not interested in personal luxury, but he cares very much about providing for his family. At the time of Robert's Rebellion, Davos was a highly professional and successful smuggler, so he must have been used to making significant amounts of money.</p>

<p>We can assume Davos wanted Stannis to pay him for his help. The garrison was running out of food, but as Storm's End was the home of the Baratheon family, they would have had gold and jewels. It is plausible that Davos planned to enter Storm's End with his cargo of food; leave the way he came in, with a large sum of money; and never see Stannis again.</p>

<p>Davos may also have felt some pity for the garrison, or admiration for their courage. By themselves, these feelings might not have been sufficient for Davos to risk his life and those of his crew; but they might have helped motivate him to undertake such a risky job.</p>

<p>Finally, Stannis was known for his sense of honour. Davos must have hoped for a fair reward; but Stannis' idea of ""fair"" was almost certainly not what Davos expected. Stannis both rewarded Davos with much more than money (making him a knight, and one of his main advisors) and punished him (cutting off his finger joints).</p>

<p>To answer the second part of the question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If no one had asked Davos to smuggle food into the castle, how did he know they were in such a bad way as to require the food he brought?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the time of Davos' voyage, Storm's End had been under siege for almost a year. At the very least, they would have long since run out of <em>fresh</em> food. This would have made them prone to scurvy and similar illnesses, and made Davos' cargo very welcome.</p>

<p>Most of the differences were, I am sure, to impart the most amount of plot information as possible in the limited time (and attention span of the average viewer) that the medium of a television series offers.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I have spotted many more, subtle and blatant, in the ongoing series, but have decided not to update the list here, primarily as it just sounds bitchy. </p>

<p>Also, I believe, I have already made my point, that HBO have kept true to the spirit of the book, although they have culled a lot (and changed a little bit) to make it a worthy television adaptation. I am enjoying it, but not as much as I did the books, but I think that was to be expected.</p>

"2925","What is a Hedge Knight?","<p>Reading the Ice and Fire books, I keep on coming across the term Hedge Knight (and, also, the apparently pejorative, Hedge Wizard). </p>

<p>What specifically does the prefix Hedge refer to?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","2927","<p>A Hedge Knight is an individual who has been dubbed as a knight, but does not owe his allegiance to any master. I guess Hedge Wizard is about the same.</p>

<p>George R. R. Martin actually uses the term <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_Dunk_and_Egg#The_Hedge_Knight"">The Hedge Knight</a> for the title of one of his short stories.</p>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>I'm not too up on medieval history, but the idea of a roving knight doesn't crop up too much from what I remember - so I think it is something in-world. I certainly haven't seen Hedge Knight used outside of Martin's works.</p>

"2967","How did Gared (Night's Watch man) get back from behind The Wall?","<p>The surviving Black Brother, Gared, from the prologue of A Game of Thrones is apparently the deserter who is beheaded in the beginning of the book. </p>

<p>But how did he manage to get to Winterfell from the other side of The Wall? Or did the show throw me off track and in the book there weren't any survivors, so the deserter is someone else?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","2969","<h1>How did the deserter to get to Winterfell from the other side of The Wall?</h1>

<p>The Wall is there primarily to keep the wildlings from crossing in large numbers (in current times, at least).  It has never stopped individuals from crossing, if they know where to look.  </p>

<p>In the books, it is mentioned later on in the series that there are many fortifications along the Wall, but over time many of them have become disused and abandoned.  Coverage is not what it used to be.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that even the Direwolf made it from beyond the Wall, so climbing over the top is clearly not the only option.</p>

<p>In A Storm of Swords it is mentioned that there are four ways to get from one side of the Wall to the other (aside from being let through the gates by the Black Brothers):  you can climb it, attempt to cross the Bay of Seals by boat, descend into the ravines to the west of the Shadow Tower, or use the array of tunnels underneath (such as Gorne's Way).</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
<em>I just re-read the part where Bran, Hodor and the Reeds cross the Wall under the Nightfort.  There is a gate that is accessible to any sworn Brother, and it is certainly possible that the deserter somehow either knew of this, or found it.</em></p>

<h1>Who is the deserter?</h1>

<p>In the TV show, the younger ranger survives, but in the book <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Gared"">Gared</a> the older ranger survives. Since the execution scene is from Bran's perspective and Bran is less concerned with who the ranger is, we are not given his name but the descriptions match up enough to show that it is Gared.</p>

<p><strong>Prologue</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gared did not rise to the bait. He was an old man, past fifty, and he
  had seen the lordlings come and go.</p>
  
  <p>...  </p>
  
  <p>Gared had spent  forty years
  in the Night's Watch, man and boy, and he was not accustomed to being
  made light of.</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>""I've had the cold in me too, lordling."" Gared
  pulled back his hood, giving Ser Weymar a good long look at the stumps
  where his ears had been. ""Two ears, three toes, and the little finger
  off my left hand."" </p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>Gared glared at the lordling, the scares around
  his ear holes flushed red with anger where Master Aemon had cut the
  ears away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the end of the prologue, Royce is dead and Will is dying. Gared was waiting with the horses so it is more possible that he survived than the others.</p>

<p><strong>Bran</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But the man they found bound hand and foot to the holdfast wall
  awaiting the king's justice was old and scrawny, not much taller than
  Robb. He had lost both ears and a finger to frostbite, and he dressed
  all in black, the same as a brother of the Night's Watch, except that
  his furs were ragged and greasy.</p>

<p>But they have cited the wrong page. They should have instead linked to the Citadel post that I have linked below. It appears to be a human error, I also initially fell for their reference but reading the chapter, it turned out the chapter was before Joffrey's demise.</p>
<p>To answer your question, no there is no mention in books either. It is understandable as Tommen is a child and giving him a razor sharp blade will be folly.</p>
<p>George R.R. Martin has confirmed that Tommen inherited the sword. See <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/FAQ/Entry/1987"" rel=""noreferrer"">this citadel post</a> for reference.</p>

<h1>Can a sword be buried with the bearer?</h1>
<p>It can be. In <em>Dunk and Egg: The Hedge Knight</em>, Ser Duncan the Tall briefly contemplates against burying sword of his Master Ser Arlan of Pennytree with him, which implies that normal swords can be buried with their bearers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’d leave your sword, but it would rust in the ground,” he said at
last, apologetic. “The gods will give you a new one, I guess. I wish
you didn’t die, ser.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However special swords which are made of Valyrian steel aren't buried with their bearers. It is evident, by the fact, Valyrian Steel swords are inherited from Father to Son spanning over centuries e.g. Heartsbane, Long Claw, Blackfyre etc.</p>
<p>So it is unlikely that Widow's Wail was buried with Joffrey since none of the other Valyrian steel swords were buried with their bearers.</p>

<p><strong>Xaro:</strong> The door and the vault is made of Valyrian stone. The hardest steel does not make a mark.

<p>That said in the books there is the material called dragonstone which is probably what Valyrian Stone in the show is meant to be.</p>

<p>The heart of Old Volantis is the city-withinthe-city—an immense labyrinth of ancient palaces, courtyards, towers, temples, cloisters, bridges, and cellars, all contained within the great oval of the Black Walls raised by the Freehold of Valyria in the first flush of its youthful expansion. Two hundred feet tall, and so thick that six four-horse chariots can race along their battlements side by side (as they do each year to celebrate the founding of the city), <strong>these seamless walls of fused black dragonstone, harder than steel or diamond, stand in mute testimony to Volantis's origins as a military outpost.</strong></p>

"67995","Are there any royal jesters in song of ice and fire?","<p>An interesting question arose in my mind, since Martin actually keeps his books quite close to the medieval history.</p>

<p>Now, almost all medieval kings in Europe (and in my native Russia too, by the way) had such thing as royal jesters (not sure about the translation correctly, maybe they should be called king's fool or king's clown). Those were the comic person, that served as an independent conscience for the king.</p>

<p>That is, those persons were the only one, that were allowed to say even the most undesirable truth in king's face, in form of a joke, and they were not punished for that.</p>

However they don't seem to have a 'Fool's license' to make political jokes. Butterbumps might well be intelligent but the other two are mentally feeble and couldn't perform the role anyway. The Starks were probably too serious to have one at Winterfell and Tywin Lannister is not known for his sense of humour either.</p>

<hr />
<p>Now just to expand on the counter examples you make for why Arya should have survived.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Robert Baratheon: Robert's death was engineered by Cersei Lannister and so it was all a set up so he would die. Add to this that Robert was then treated by Grand Maester Pycelle who was under Cersei's payroll it is no wonder that he passed away from his severe wounds.</p>

<li><p>Khal Drogo: He had more than just a scratch but it wasn't necassarily a bad wound. However, the Dothraki don't really have the same level of medical care as the rest of the world. On top of this we then have the fact that Dany convinced him to let Mirri Maz Durr treat him who then might have had a helping hand in his death.</p>

<li><p>Talisa - She dies pretty quickly so it seems obvious that her wound was a lot worse than the one Arya sustains.</p>

<p>Had they reached the wall then they would have passed through a brutal indoctrination and training regime. This would either have made them functional members or killed them. If they deserted, what was the loss? They would be recaptured and executed. Killing of fellow legionaries presupposes that those legionaries would allow this to happen.</p>

<ul>
<li>The original idea was to show a map, but this was too… flat. So the artists decided to depict intricate miniatures — denoting top-notch craftsmanship as a metaphor for GRRM's writing.</li>
<li>The style evokes the kinds of miniatures that could have been built with about the technology in the story. It's as if a talented and devoted artist from the GoT world had made them.</li>
<li>The world is shown as the inside of a sphere to make the “camera” movements look better — zoom out from a location, rotate the camera, zoom into a different location, without risking showing an edge of the world.</li>
<li>The miniatures depict locations that are seen in the episode. Thus the intro sequence varies from episode to episode: it depends on the visited locations. In addition, there are minor variations in the cuts, just to introduce a little unpredictability.</li>

<p>It's worth noting that there has has been some overlap. Certain events have drifted into different seasons, so the above isn't <em>always</em> strictly true -- just mostly true.</p>

<p>Season 6 took most of its story from <em>The Winds of Winter</em> (although there were some unused things from <em>A Feast for Crows</em> and <em>A Dance with Dragons</em> that appeared in it). George RR Martin confirmed this in a Vanity Fair article (""<a href=""http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/03/george-r-r-martin-interview"">George R.R.

"3577","Why did Tyrion visit the Wall?","<p><em>Game of Thrones</em> has Tyrion visiting the Wall, simply as he wanted to see it.</p>

<p>Watching this, I had the feeling that, in the novel, there was another, less arbitrary, reason, but I can't recall it. </p>

<p>Am I remembering correctly, or was Tyrion simply being a curious tourist?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","3589","<p>I have the book in front of me. There was no reason mentioned other than Tyrion wanting to satisfy his curiosity. Or as he put it:</p>

"208423","Why would the Red Woman birth a shadow if she worshipped the Lord of the Light?","<p>Is there any reasoning or explanation as to why Melisandre would birth a shadow if she was a follower of the Lord of the Light religion? It seems somewhat contradictive that a Light worshiper would birth a form of darkness...</p>

<p>Follow up question: why did the shadow disappear immediately after killing Renly? Why not stay around longer to perform other tasks for Stannis?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","208424","<h2>Books</h2>
<p>Ser Davos asked the same thing of Melisandre when he was taking her to slay Ser Cortnay Penrose, Renly's Castellan for Storm's End.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There was no need,” she said. “He was unprotected. But here... this
Storm’s End is an old place. There are spells woven into the stones.
Dark walls that no shadow can pass-ancient, forgotten, yet still in
place.”</p>
<p><strong>“Shadow?” Davos felt his flesh prickling. “A shadow is a thing of
darkness.”</strong></p>
<p>“You are more ignorant than a child, ser knight. <strong>There are no shadows
in the dark. Shadows are the servants of light, the children of fire.
The brightest flame casts the darkest shadows.”</strong><br><sub> <strong>ACOK - Davos II</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the show the dialogue went differently but the essence was same:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Davos</strong>: Strange that this Lord of Light asks you to work in the shadows.</p>
<p><strong>Melisandre</strong>: Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos. They are servants of light, the children of fire. And the brighter the flame,
the darker they are.<br><sub> <strong>Garden of Bones- S02E04</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As to why didn't the Shadow linger around to perform more tasks, there is no information available on that. But my speculation would be that they are a single-use disposable sort of weapon. We see that the Shadow which opened Renly's throat disappeared immediately after his job. And the Shadow which killed Ser Cortnay Penrose vanished as well. Afterwards we see Melisandre asking Ser Davos to make a shadow-baby with her (Since the King's fires were burning low and Melisandre was afraid that another attempt might kill him), Ser Davos refused her.</p>

"3697","Why did Daenerys follow her brother's bidding at all? What was their relationship like before the events of the first episode?","<p>So the sixth episode of <em>Game of Thrones</em> just aired, and while I enjoyed it very much, I couldn't help but be bewildered at why things had to come to the extreme end they escalated to &mdash; the threatening of her unborn child &mdash; before Daenerys finally abandoned her arrogant brother Viserys to his fate.   I mean, from what's been revealed so far, in every single facet Viserys has not shown even once a hint of brotherly love towards his sister; every one of his dealings about her affairs has been a cold plotting to have himself one day assume the throne.  Regular brothers and sisters don't act like that towards one another, I shouldn't think.  </p>

<p>So, I was wondering: In the books, is anything revealed about the prior relationship the two had, and why such a rift would have developed between them?  And indeed, if such a rift existed, why would she follow him at all and marry into a kingdom whose people she initially hated?  I really don't mind being spoiled; I have no plans as yet to read the books on my own.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","3702","<p>Much of the back story is made clear in the books.  Viserys has always been arrogant and cruel toward his sister.  Some of it is probably hereditary.  The Targaryens had a long ""tradition"" of marrying brother to sister, which accounts for their distinctive hair and eye color, and occasional cases of madness.  Viserys's father Aerys Targaryen was called the ""Mad King"" and for very good reasons.  He was obsessed with fire, he abused his wife, and he burned Ned Stark's father and brother alive.</p>

<p>So you have a boy whose father was a king and a paranoid schizophrenic, who is a product of a long history of incest, who lost his parents at a young age, and who is raised by strangers on the stories about how he is really the rightful king of a vast kingdom, and how that kingdom was stolen from him.  Oh, and unlike Daenerys, he is not very bright.  Also, Viserys is resentful that he does not get to marry Daenerys himself, as is the custom of his family.</p>

<p>On the other hand Daenerys puts up with him until the very end for the same reason children put up with abusive parents.  She was born after her father was killed by Jaime Lannister, and her mother died in childbirth.  Viserys is the only family she has, and the only family she has ever known.</p>

<p>And, yes, you do have to keep in mind that all the children are older in the series than in the books.  In the book Dany is only 13 when she is married to Khal Drogo.</p>

<p>Also, do not forget that much of what is ""regular"" today was not at all regular during the medieval times.</p>

"208603","Why was the small council so happy for Tyrion to become the Master of Coin?","<p>In S03E02, Tywin Lannister names Tyrion the Master of Coin, followed by Varys and Cersei quickly smirking at Tyrion (and Pycelle being enthusiastic about the development).</p>

<p>Why were they so happy for Tyrion to take on Master of Coin? Just because it's maybe such a boring job? Wouldn't the Master of Coin have a great amount of power in King's Landing, given that wars, etc., are funded and at the discretion of the Master of Coin? </p>
","<game-of-thrones>","208605","<p>Firstly, the Master of Coin isn't seen as a particularly prestigious position; in S04E08, Bronze Yohn Royce insults Peter Baelish by saying it has </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Secondly, Tyrion freely admits that he has no knowledge of how money works beyond spending it, and is thus particularly ill-suited to the job. Those around the council table do seem to take pleasure in other people's discomfort, especially when it comes to Tyrion.</p>

<p>Lastly, with regards to it being a position of power, under Robert Baratheon this was plainly true as Robert spent prodigiously and freely, which helped Baelish to improve his own situation. With Tywin ultimately now in control, its likely that Tyrion would have to find money at his father's direction and without much autonomy.</p>

"68794","Who are the 3 men who would have a chance against Jaime Lannister in a sword fight?","<p>In <em>Game of Thrones</em> season 2, episode 8, &quot;The Prince of Winterfell&quot;, Jaime Lannister says to Brienne:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me [in a sword fight]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Who are those three people?</strong></p>
<p><div class=""youtube-embed""><div>
                <iframe width=""640px"" height=""395px"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/tLIhcOm_0wY?start=86""></iframe>
            </div></div></p>
<p>I don't believe this quote, or any variation, appears in the books. There was this quote from <em>A Storm of Swords</em> when he is fighting Brienne:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She is stronger than I am.</p>
<p>The realization chilled him. Robert had been stronger than him, to be sure. The White Bull Gerold Hightower as well, in his heyday, and Ser Arthur Dayne. Amongst the living, Greatjon Umber was stronger, Strongboar of Crakehall most likely, both Cleganes for a certainty. The Mountain’s strength was like nothing human. It did not matter. With speed and skill, Jaime could beat them all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the books suggest that Jaime can beat anyone, though he is only referring to people of great strength, not necessarily of great skill (somebody such as Barristan Selmy, who is not considered to be exceptionally strong but is exceptionally skillful, may be able to beat him).</p>
<p>Is there any canon evidence to suggest who these three people may be?</p>
<p>I won't accept any purely speculative answers. However if there is no direct canon quote answering the question (which I believe to be the case) I will consider answers that are strongly inferred from canonical sources (such as a canon quote saying X is the greatest fighter in the kingdom, for example).</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","68803","<p>I'm going to have to agree with the answer they gave when this question was posed on the Movies &amp; TV Stack Exchange: <strong>there's no way to tell</strong>. Jaime never says who the three men are, and without the benefit of his internal monologue, we'll never know for sure. The only person Jaime had ever fought at this point in the show is Ned, who is already dead.</p>

<p>But if we had to make a guess based on the books, I can think of a few possibilities. It's possible the screenwriter had based the line off of the section you quoted above. Of the four men who are stronger than Jaime AND currently alive, three have been depicted in the show: <strong>Greatjon Umber and the Cleganes</strong>.</p>

<p>Another possibility is that there are three people who are confirmed in the books to have beaten Jaime Lannister in a tourney match: <strong>Loras Tyrell</strong> on Joffrey's nameday, <strong>Jorah Mormount</strong> after the Greyjoy Rebellion, and <strong>Sandor Clegane</strong> in celebration of Ned being named Hand of the King. The only problem with this interpretation is that Mormount is not ""in the kingdoms.""</p>

<p>Another interpretation might be that Jaime is thinking of people who have beaten him, broadly speaking. In that case, Jorah Mormount could be replaced with <strong>Robb Stark</strong>, who outsmarted and captured him earlier in the war.</p>

<p>I guess it's worth noting that any way you slice it, Sandor Clegane makes the cut. Good for him!</p>

<li><strong>Regarding them being a couple</strong>: Catelyn notes at Renly's wedding that Renly seems more focused on Loras than Margaery, Oberyn describes Loras as ""Renly’s little rose"", and Jaime threatens to shove Loras's sword ""up some place even Renly never found"".

"142631","What did Varys do to the Sorcerer?","<p>Either right before or right after the battle of the Blackwater Varys tells Tyrion that a Sorcerer castrated him and used his genitals to perform a ritual. In S03E04 Varys reveals a man in a crate to Tyrion and Tyrion assumes that it is the Sorcerer. After this we never see the Sorcerer and it is never brought up again until Kinvara speaks to Varys about it, but it is rather a one sided conversation. So what actually happens to the Sorcerer? Varys mentions in season six that he hates torturing people but are we meant to believe that he made an exception for the Sorcerer? Even if we are never given a straight answer I would be happy with any implications we could draw from the evidence given.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","142693","<h1>Show</h1>
<p>As you mention, in the show he appears in just one episode of season 3. Afterwards there is no mention of what happened to the man.</p>
<p>The complete dialogue will help build some context for our readers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Varys</strong>: As a boy, I travelled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities. One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too
tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some
men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a
potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to
dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem,
chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames
turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call.</p>
<p>I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I
dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A
conjuror's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice
answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those
who practice it.</p>
<p>But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis
and his Red Priestess. A symbolic revenge of sorts.</p>
<p><strong>Tyrion:</strong> Yes, ahem. <strong>I feel</strong>
<strong>the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to</strong>
<strong>have me killed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Varys:</strong> Which will require a degree of influence, which ... You do not possess
at the moment. <strong>But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have</strong>
<strong>found.</strong></p>
<p>Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose, he threw me out of his house
to die.</p>
<p><strong>I resolved to live to spite him</strong>. I begged. I sold what parts of my
body remained to me. I became an excellent thief and soon learned that
the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of
his purse. Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my
way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber.</p>
<p>Influence grows like a weed. <strong>I tended mine patiently</strong> until its
tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side
of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very
special. The sorcerer.</p>
<p><strong>Hello, my old friend. It's been a long time</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, Varys tells Tyrion that he fought Stannis and the Red Woman to have a symbolic revenge on sorcerers; however Tyrion feels the need to exact an actual revenge on the King's Guard who tried to kill him. On that Varys tells him that he needs to be patient to have that kind of influence and mentions that he has found out that influence grows with patience, implying that he himself garnered that kind of influence after being patient for decades and now he was finally on cusp of exacting his revenge.</p>
<p>So one thing is clear, the man's fate wasn't pleasant. He would have been killed in the end, to be sure, however I don't think Varys would have allowed him the mercy of a quick death after so patiently waiting for the day to exact his revenge for years. He must have given him a very slow, very painful death.</p>
<p>Also a Reddit <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/2ctyvb/season_3_spoilers_what_did_varys_do_with_the/cjj6sca"" rel=""noreferrer"">comment</a> that I think is helpful here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Varys didn't just happen to conveniently have his tormentor taken
there the same time a relevant discussion about it happened to come
up.</p>
<p>I interpreted the scene as though the man had been held captive for
quite awhile. The &quot;wasn't gonna be something nice&quot; action that Varys
took was keeping the man alive in a small box for an indeterminate
amount of time.</p>
<p>I feel like it completely went over people's heads that the &quot;revenge&quot;
was trapping the guy and keeping him barely alive, as opposed to just
killing him.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h1>Books</h1>
<p>In the books, however Varys never managed to capture the Sorcerer. He mentioned that story before the Battle of Blackwater Bay, as opposed to the show where he tells that story to Tyrion after the battle.</p>
<p>In <em>ACOK, Tyrion X</em>, he tells Tyrion about the day he was cut to explain to him that he suspects that Stannis dabbles with Dark arts and therefore Varys wants him dead. It was more or less the same as the TV show and it is an awfully large passage so I'd not be including it here.</p>
<p>In any case, in the books, Varys hasn't done anything to the Sorcerer. At least not anything that we know of since the Eunuch is extremely secretive about his personal life and doesn't have a POV chapter.</p>

<p>She says something along the lines of ""I hope I got the details right.""</p>

<p>It is unlikely that she asked Tyrion himself about it as he seems surprised to be receiving it. It is possible that she asked Jorah about it but we don't really see them alone and they likely have not spoken off screen since maybe half way through season 5. Even if she did ask him about it, it seems unlikely that Jorah would have ever even seen the ""Hand of the King"" pin.</p>

<p>So my question is, how did Daenerys know what the ""Hand of the King"" pin looked like? Both the Westerosi Hand of the King pin and the Hand of the Queen pin that Daenerys gives to Tyrion look very similar considering that Daenerys has never spent a day of her adult life in Westeros.</p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","142691","<h1>Books</h1>
<p>First of all, this is a show only event. It has never happened in the books as Books ended when the Dothraki found Daenerys. Later, in absence of the Queen, Ser Barristan Selmy assumed the office of Hand of the King to govern the realm. From <em>ADWD, Chapter 59</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though <strong>he had assumed the title of Hand, Ser Barristan would not
presume to hold court in the queen's absence</strong>, nor would he permit
Skahaz mo Kandaq to do such.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However since you have added the books tag, Books do refer to how she got her knowledge of Westeros. From <em>AGOT, Chapter 46:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My mother died giving me birth, and my father and my brother Rhaegar
even before that. <strong>I would never have known so much as their names if
Viserys had not been there to tell me</strong>. He was the only one left. The
only one. He is all I have</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also from <em>AGOT Daenerys VI</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>She had never seen the Seven Kingdoms either, no more than Drogo, yet she felt as though she knew them from all the tales her brother
had told her</strong>. Viserys had promised her a thousand times that he
would take her back one day, but he was dead now and his promises had
died with him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Viserys had even told her about the Tourneys. From <em>ADWD Daenerys V</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;One would be enough if he were as true as you.&quot; The day might come
soon when she would have need of every knight. &quot;Will they joust for
me? I should like that.&quot; <strong>Viserys had told her stories of the
tourneys he had witnessed in the Seven Kingdoms, but Dany had never
seen a joust herself</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also from <em>AGOT, Daenerys I</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Yet sometimes Dany would picture the way it had been, so often had her brother told her the stories</strong>. The midnight flight to
Dragonstone, moonlight shimmering on the ship's black sails.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Viserys also told her about the Targaryen custom of incest. From <em>AGOT, Daenerys I:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>She had always assumed that she would wed Viserys when she came of
age. For centuries the Targaryens had married brother to sister, since
Aegon the Conqueror had taken his sisters to bride. <strong>The line must be
kept pure, Viserys had told her a thousand times; theirs was the
kingsblood, the golden blood of old Valyria, the blood of the
dragon</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also told her about History of House Targaryen's dragons. From <em>AGOT, Daenerys III:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Viserys had told her that the last Targaryen dragons had died no more than a century and a half ago</strong>, during the reign of Aegon III,
who was called the Dragonbane.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also from <em>ADWD, Daenerys II</em>, he told her about the Dance of the Dragons:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Viserys had told her all the tales when she was little</strong>. He loved to talk of dragons. She knew how Harrenhal had fallen. She knew about
the Field of Fire and the Dance of the Dragons. One of her forebears,
the third Aegon, had seen his own mother devoured by his uncle's
dragon. And there were songs beyond count of villages and kingdoms
that lived in dread of dragons till some brave dragonslayer rescued
them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was also Viserys, whose knowledge had saved Daenerys' dragons from starvation in <em>ACOK, Daenerys I</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Or rather, tried to feed them, for the dragons would not eat. They
would hiss and spit at each bloody morsel of horsemeat, steam rising
from their nostrils, yet <strong>they would not take the food . . . until
Dany recalled something Viserys had told her when they were
children</strong>.</p>
<p>Only dragons and men eat cooked meat, he had said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also told her about the Throne room and Dragon skulls that adorned the walls. From <em>ASOS, Daenerys I:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<strong>Viserys talked of those skulls</strong>,&quot; said Dany. &quot;The Usurper took
them down and hid them away. He could not bear them looking down on
him upon his stolen throne.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also told her about Tragedy of Summerhall. From <em>ASOS, Daenerys V</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Viserys had spoken of Rhaegar's birth only once</strong>. Perhaps the tale saddened him too much. &quot;It was the shadow of Summerhall that haunted
him, was it not?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also told her about theology and faith. From <em>ASOS, Daenerys VI:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Westeros had seven gods at least, though <strong>Viserys had told her that
some septons said the seven were only aspects of a single god</strong>, seven
facets of a single crystal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So here we see, Daenerys knows all she knows thanks to Viserys. To sum it up, following are the subjects Viserys told her about:</p>
<ol>
<li>Her self, Her rights and Her House</li>
<li>The tales of Seven Kingdoms</li>
<li>Customs and culture of Seven Kingdoms</li>
<li>History of House Targaryen</li>
<li>Some mysteries of Dragonlore</li>
<li>History of Dragons</li>
<li>Faith of the Seven Kingdoms</li>
</ol>
<p>So if this event does happen in the books, It would most likely be Viserys who would have told her about the pin and the office of Hand of the King.</p>
<hr />
<h1>Show</h1>
<p>There is no indication in the show that who told her about the office and its pin.</p>
<p>The exact dialogue in S06E10 was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Daenerys: I, um... <strong>I had something made for you. I'm not sure if
it's right</strong>. Tyrion Lannister, I name you Hand of the Queen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since she wasn't sure about the exact appearance having never seen the pin personally but yet had it made, that implies she did so with help of verbal description she may have heard from someone. Following are the candidates who may have told her about the pin custom:</p>
<ol>
<li>Viserys Targaryen</li>
<li>Jorah Mormont</li>
<li>Barristan Selmy</li>
<li>Tyrion Lannister</li>
</ol>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","69024","<p>From wikipedia, it happens in <strong>A Game of Thrones, Chapter 59, Catelyn IX</strong>. 
 <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Game_of_Thrones-Chapter_59"">Robb’s host arrives at the Twins, where Catelyn negotiates their crossing of the Green Fork with Lord Walder Frey</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For allowing him crossing and his allegiance at the Twins, Lord Walder Frey extracts the price of a marriage contract, ensuring that Robb will marry a daughter of his house to be chosen after the war is finished.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Catelyn returns to Robb followed by Ser Jared Frey, Ser Hosteen Frey, Ser Danwell Frey, Walder’s bastard Ronel Rivers, and a long column of pikemen. She tells Robb that he has been granted the crossing and that all but 400 of Lord Frey’s forces will join his army. In exchange, two of Lord Walder’s grandsons will be fostered by the Starks at Winterfell, Olyvar Frey will become Robb’s squire, Arya will marry Walder’s youngest son Elmar, and Robb himself will marry his choice of Lord Walder’s daughters when the fighting is done. Robb, realizing he has no choice if he wants to cross, consents. Catelyn suggests that he should leave 400 archers and swordsmen at the Twins to ensure Lord Walder keeps faith under a reliable man.

  <p> Lord Roose fought at the Battle of the Trident during Robert's Rebellion.

<p>The actual mention of this event happens in <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Game_of_Thrones-Chapter_33"">Chapter 33 of AGOT</a>. Anyway, why did Roose offer this advice?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","69046","<p>Ser Barristan Selmy was a member of Aerys II's kingsguard, and one of the best fighters in the world.

<p>Additionally Roose has no qualms with violence. He comes from a family that used flaying as a torture device. In A Storm of Swords/Season 5:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>he betrayed and killed his Liege Lord/King Robb Stark at his uncle's wedding</p>

<li><p>Craster kept his daughters around so that he could have sex with them.</p></li>

<p>Which one's correct? Can there be female White Walkers?</p>

<p>Answers from books would be valid.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","208905","<p>TL;DR: We have the case of the Night's Queen who is spoken about in the books and appears in one of the Histories &amp; Lore videos in the show. Whilst she is spoken about as an Other/White Walker she could actually be a wight as it is never stated explicitly although I'd say the evidence points to her as being an Other/White Walker.</p>
<p>We also have evidence of some potential hybrid Other/human species in the books and in the show it is implied that Craster sacrificed some of his daughter wives as well as the sons.</p>
<h1>Game of Thrones</h1>
<p>There is mention of the “Night’s Queen” in the series though it is actually from one of the Histories &amp; Lore videos, as far as I’m aware nothing is mentioned in the main episodes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We Free Folk have our stories, too. About how one of your king crows found something cold in the woods... with bright blue eyes. How he brought her home, through your wall, and declared himself &quot;Night's King&quot;. For thirteen years he and his queen ruled over his brothers, making sacrifices as black as their cloaks. Lucky for you southerners, the Free Folk rallied to a King-Beyond-the-Wall, as we will when need be, and marched on the ancient castle he had taken as his own, the Nightfort. With the help of the Starks, we killed the demon and cleansed your precious watch. An' then they thanked us, an' kicked us back across the wall... as you always have.</p>

<p>From this all we know of her is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>she was “cold”</li>
<li>she had bright blue eyes</li>
<li>she was the Night’s King’s queen</li>
<li>she was killed by the Free Folk and Starks</li>
</ul>
<p>From this we know she got her title from being the Night’s King’s queen though there is no evidence that she actually had that title. From the description of her it could be said she was a White Walker but we don’t know for sure.</p>

<h1>A Song of Ice and Fire</h1>
<p>In the books we have mention of the Night's Queen who was the downfall of the Night's King as the ruled at the Nightfort. It is <em>only</em> heavily implied that she was an Other but from the context of the story she probably was.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the sun began to set the shadows of the towers lengthened and the wind blew harder, sending gusts of dry dead leaves rattling through the yards. The gathering gloom put Bran in mind of another of Old Nan's stories, the tale of Night's King. He had been the thirteenth man to lead the Night's Watch, she said; a warrior who knew no fear. &quot;And that was the fault in him,&quot; she would add, &quot;for all men must know fear.&quot; A woman was his downfall; a woman glimpsed from atop the Wall, with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars. Fearing nothing, he chased her and caught her and loved her, though her skin was cold as ice, and when he gave his seed to her he gave his soul as well.</p>
<p>He brought her back to the Nightfort and proclaimed her a queen and himself her king, and with strange sorceries he bound his Sworn Brothers to his will. For thirteen years they had ruled, Night's King and his corpse queen, till finally the Stark of Winterfell and Joramun of the wildlings had joined to free the Watch from bondage. After his fall, when it was found he had been sacrificing to the Others, all records of Night's King had been destroyed, his very name forbidden.</p>
<p><sub><em>A Storm of Swords</em>, Bran IV</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That maesters themselves don't believe she was a &quot;corpse queen&quot; but probably someone from the Barrowlands which lends evidence to the fact that she may not have been an Other. Howevber, it's worth noting that the maesters seem to have pushed all of the supernatural away as folk stories and fairy tales and so their judgement in cases like this is clouded.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet over the thousands of years of its existence as the chief seat of the Watch, the Nightfort has accrued many legends of its own, some of which have been recounted in Archmaester Harmune's Watchers on the Wall. The oldest of these tales concern the legendary Night's King, the thirteenth Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, who was alleged to have bedded a sorceress pale as a corpse and declared himself a king. For thirteen years the Night's King and his &quot;corpse queen&quot; ruled together, before King of Winter, Brandon the Breaker, (in alliance, it is said, with the King-Beyond-the-Wall, Joramun) brought them down. Thereafter, he obliterated the Night's King's very name from memory.</p>
<p>In the Citadel, the archmaesters largely dismiss these tales—though some allow that there may have been a Lord Commander who attempted to carve out a kingdom for himself in the earliest days of the Watch. Some suggest that perhaps the corpse queen was a woman of the Barrowlands, a daughter of the Barrow King who was then a power in his own right, and oft associated with graves. The Night's King has been said to have been variously a Bolton, a Woodfoot, an Umber, a Flint, a Norrey, or even a Stark, depending on where the tale is told. Like all tales, it takes on the attributes that make it most appealing to those who tell it.</p>
<p><sub><em>The World of Ice and Fire</em>, The Wall and Beyond: The Night’s Watch</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is worth noting that Old Nan states that the wildling woman would lay with the Others and a hybrid species were created which could have been what the Night's Queen was.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The man had been taken outside a small holdfast in the hills. Robb thought he was a wildling, his sword sworn to Mance Rayder, the King-beyond-the-Wall. It made Bran's skin prickle to think of it. He remembered the hearth tales Old Nan told them. The wildlings were cruel men, she said, slavers and slayers and thieves. They consorted with giants and ghouls, stole girl children in the dead of night, and drank blood from polished horns. And their women lay with the Others in the Long Night to sire terrible half-human children.</p>

"4145","Why did Robb not pursue alternative ways of crossing the river in ""Baelor""?","<p>In the ""Baelor"" episode of Game of Thrones, I was confused when the Starks had to negotiate with the Frey clan in order to cross the river. Was there no other way across the river? Did they not have boats or enough resources to quickly build a bridge?</p>

<p>Is this explained better in the books?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","4150","<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VoOqm.jpg"" alt=""The Riverlands"">
Here's a closeup map of the Riverlands. Robb Stark's host was moving south from the Grey&#x200a;<strong>water</strong> Watch (mislabeled in the image) which is at the very top of map. They needed to go South towards Riverrun, which is the House Tully seat being besieged by Jaime Lannister (very bottom of the map). To do that they needed to cross the Green Fork, which was flooding at the time, so the only way to cross was to use the bridge spanning the Twins or go much farther south along the river, exposing them to Lannister troops and wasting valuable time. Hence the need to negotiate with Lord Walder Frey.</p>

<p>Relevant book passage (pp. 640-641 in my paperback copy in a Catelyn chapter):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Theon shook his head. ""The river's running high and fast. Ser Brynden says it can't be forded, not this far north""</p>
  
  <p>""I <em>must</em> have that crossing!"" Robb declared, fuming. ""Oh, our horses might be able to swim the river, I suppose, but not with armored men on their backs. We'd need to build rafts to pole our steel across, helms and mail and lances, and we don't have the trees for that. <em>Or</em> the time. Lord Typwin is marching north..."" He balled his hand into a fist.</p>
  
  <p>""Lord Frey would be a fool to try and bar our way,"" Theon Greyjoy said with his customary easy confidence. ""We have five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you need to, Robb.""</p>
  
  <p>""Not easily,"" Catelyn warned them, ""and not in time. While you were mounting your siege, Tywin Lannister would bring up his host and assault you from the rear""</p>

"69082","Why didn't Cersei want Eddard Stark dead?","<p>I think Eddard Stark with knowledge of twincest would be far more dangerous, compared to possible reaction of North for a dead Eddard Stark. Especially when his heir was a 'kid' (Robb). Sending him to the Wall would not solve the problem because, as we see with Benjen Stark; he could still visit Winterfell and tell everyone what he knows.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><politics>","69129","<p>It's very important that Cersei didn't <strong>only</strong> send Eddard to the Wall; she required him to publicly confess to treason. On the steps of the Great Sept, Eddard told the crowd that he had tried to seize the throne for himself, and Joffrey was the legitimate son of Cersei and King Robert.</p>

<p>If Eddard had gone to the Wall as planned, but later spoken out against Cersei, he would have two major problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>Brothers of the Night's Watch are not permitted to take part in the politics of the Seven Kingdoms. If Eddard opposed Cersei, he would be breaking his vows and endangering the NW as a whole (because it depends for its long-term survival on neutrality in any conflicts which take place in the south). If necessary, the other NW brothers might have taken steps to stop him from interfering in politics.</li>
<li>Eddard would effectively be saying that his solemn confession of treason was a lie told to save his own life. Cersei could then say the confession was true, and Eddard was telling lies because he still wanted the Iron Throne for himself. Either way, Eddard was lying. So his reputation as an extremely honourable man is ruined, which would greatly reduce his authority.</li>
</ul>

<p>The other reason Cersei wanted Eddard to live, is that the Lannisters were facing a civil war against Renly and Stannis. If Eddard was allowed to join the Night's Watch, Robb Stark might be persuaded to remain neutral in the war, allowing the Lannisters to deal with their other enemies. If instead Eddard was executed, Robb and the other northern lords would almost certainly go to war.</p>

<p>As it turns out,</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Eddard is killed and this is exactly what happens. Eddard was a very popular leader in the North, so the northern lords were almost as angry as Robb, and more than willing to support a war against the Lannnisters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So allowing Eddard to live was a calculated risk, but one Cersei was willing to take.</p>

"142778","Why does Daenerys Targaryen have dark eyebrows?","<p>On the show, why does Daenerys Targaryen have dark eyebrows? Isn't her platinum/gold/silvery hair supposed to be her hair all over? ... this couldn't possibly by an effects gaffe that the showrunners argued with Emilia Clark about - could it?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","142919","<h3>Blondes can naturally have dark eye brows</h3>
<p>As already mentioned, blondes can have naturally dark eye brows.  Many do, in fact.</p>
<h3>Actress' natural appearance</h3>
<p>The actress is originally a brunette, and therefore it is understandable that she might not want to get her eyebrows dyed for years. She wears a wig to pull off the silvery outlook, and that's about it.</p>
<h3>Filming issues</h3>
<p>The lighting in the shooting can make light eye brows almost invisible. A prime example here would be <a href=""http://vikings.wikia.com/wiki/File:Helga_Profile.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Helga from Vikings</a>, whose eyebrows look bad to be honest. That is, of course, if you can spot them at all. And bear in mind, those are her real eyebrows.</p>
<h3>Legal and medical issues</h3>
<p>Coloring eye brows is medically dangerous and in some places, illegal.</p>
<p>There are no oxidative dyes that are approved by the American FDA for use on eyebrows due, in large part, to the high amount of ammonia used in the color. Concentrated ammonia can cause nerve damage. Bear in mind, just under your skin, hidden behind your eyebrow a mere millimeter or so, there is a major facial nerve.</p>
<p>So usage of such dyes would be technically illegal although I am aware that many hair saloons in USA offer such services nevertheless.</p>
<p>This can lead to blindness or facial paralysis, a fate producers might want to save their lead actress from. Not to mention, to save themselves from lawsuits.</p>
<h3>Why don't they use alternatives?</h3>
<p>As you suggest, painting is a viable alternative (Although I don't quite see how they could paint the dark hair blonde without bleaching it first but then again I am not a hair styling expert so lets assume it is a safe alternative). Moreover, eyebrow wigs are also available.</p>
<p>So why don't they use the alternate methods? No idea. There's nothing on the internet which suggests why they did what they did. A safe guess would be that the actress isn't open to those methods at all.</p>
<h3>What say you, Oh Martin?</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>That again? Really?<br><br> sigh</p>

<p>As you can see, they aren't very bothered about the minor details. The fact that blondes can have darker eye brows makes it all the more unnecessary to waste time on that trivial, irrelevant detail.</p>
<hr />
<p>Further info w.r.t actual regulations<sup>1</sup> as provided by <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/24024/broklynite"">Broklynite</a> in comments (tip of the hat to him):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the best of my knowledge there are no hair dyes approved by FDA,
period. This is because they are typically made using coal tar dyes
and harmful. They get away with it as a cosmetic because the argument
is that it is not supposed to be used where it touches the skin itself
or the roots, and therefore isn't harmful. This is for all hair dyes,
eyebrows are not singled out. However, the FDA does have regulations
about colors which are permitted near the eyes specifically. But
bleaching may be considered something else tho still fall under
cosmetics. I would check the actual regulations.</p>
<p>This is a little bit complex, so please bear with me.</p>
<p>With regard to dyes: a list of approved colors and what they can be
used for may be found on the FDA website at <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/ColorAdditives/ColorAdditiveInventories/ucm106626.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ucm106626</a> and a
little more info at <a href=""https://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/ColorAdditives/ColorAdditiveInventories/ucm127988.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ucm127988</a>.</p>
<p>According to <em>601 (a)</em> adulterated cosmetics of the FD&amp;C Act, hair dye
may contain coal tar dyes if they have a warning label which includes
explicitly forbidding its use for eyebrows and eyelashes. According to
<a href=""https://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/ColorAdditives/ColorAdditiveInventories/ucm143066.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ucm143066</a> on the FDA website:</p>
<p>&quot;No color additives are approved for dyeing the eyebrows or
eyelashes.&quot;</p>
<p>So long story short: no coloring eyebrows with dyes tho non-dye</p>
<p>Colorants may be used such as approved color powders (like makeup).</p>
<p>As to bleaching, the active ingredient in hair bleach is hydrogen
peroxide, typically 30% strength (note that your home stuff is usually
2-3%). Hydrogen peroxide is on the FDA list of Substances Generally
Recognized As Safe. However <a href=""http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh%20/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=184.1366"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">21 CFR 184.1366</a> goes a bit more into
detail that it refers to the use in food and cloth.</p>
<p>However, Since hair bleach at 30% is an openly dangerous chemical, I
would suspect that it's use near eyes would no longer be considered a
cosmetic but instead as exposure to a dangerous chemical, in which
case OSHA may take a step in.</p>
<p>More or less, any company dumb enough to use it would open themselves
to a lawsuit for hazardous work environments even if this is not
covered explicitly by FDA. That said, it may fall under another FDA
regulation or be an interpretation of a regulation which I am
unfamiliar with.</p>
<p>On re-reading sec 601 I note it says:</p>
<p>&quot;a cosmetic shall be deemed to be adulterated:</p>
<ol>
<li>if it bears or contains any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render it injurious to users UNDER THE CONDITIONS OF USE
PRESCRIBED IN THE LABELING THEREOF...&quot; (emphasis mine) which would
seem to cover the unsafe use of 30% hydrogen peroxide near the eyes.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>If the label says to use it near the eyes, the manufacturer gets
busted. If the label does not say to use around the eyes and they use
it anyway, HBO gets busted for using it.</p>
<p>FDA site on eye cosmetic safety found ucm048943. Note that 601 (a)
explicitly states that hair dye does not refer to &quot;eyelash dyes or
eyebrow dyes.&quot;</p>
<p>So would be going with the more generalized harmful cosmetics
regulations I think. Not a lawyer though, and not representing the
Agency in this long series of comments, just pointing to publicly
available information on regulations and Agency publications. Your
mileage on this info may vary, and this does not constitute
recommendations or legal advice.</p>
<p>I make no claims as to the veracity of my statements.</p>

<p>Were they enemies? Was Roose just jealous of Eddard for being Warden of the North? Was Roose's treason only motivated by power? </p>

<p>What was the relation between the Starks and the Boltons?</p>

<p>Feel free to enlighten me if my questions seem unclear!</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","178596","<p>Complementing System Down's answer, yes the Stark and Bolton rivalry is centuries old when <strong>both of them used to be Kings</strong> of their own domains.</p>

<p>House Bolton ruled as the Red Kings while the Starks ruled as the Winter Kings. The domain of the Boltons stretched from the Last River to the White Knife and the Sheepshead Hills. Given that both realms were expanding in the aftermath of the Long Night, that soon brought them into direct conflict for dominance over the North. </p>

<p>As System Down suggested, thus began the Bolton tradition of flaying Starks. That was not the full extent of their military successes, Kings Royce II Bolton and Royce IV Bolton even burnt Winterfell after defeating the Starks.</p>

<p>But then the Andal invasion began and the last Red King, Rogar Bolton chose to accept the Starks as their liege Lords instead of fighting the Andals alone and falling like the Southern Kingdoms of the First Men had before. Together, the Starks and the Boltons defeated the Andals and as a result, the North remains the heartland of the First Men and their religion.</p>

<p>As vassals, they have mostly remained loyal to the Starks except a few times when they rebelled. The Boltons and the Greystarks allied against the Starks of Winterfell but lost, House Bolton survived, the Greystarks did not. They also rebelled during reign of King Harlon Stark but bent the knee after a siege of two years.</p>

<p>Roose Bolton's personal motto is  ""A peaceful land, a quiet people"". Neither of those are possible without respecting your Liege Lord's authority. He honored his vows to Winterfell when Eddard Stark called his banners for Robert. He again honored his vows when Robb Stark called the banners. </p>

<p>But as things turned out, the Starks were moving from one disaster to another. Roose figured out that the Starks were bound to lose and he did not plan on being on the losing side. He then got into negotiations with Lord Tywin and the Red Wedding happened. </p>

<p>As for Eddard's relationship, we have no evidence for warm relations or strained relations. Jon however says while Eddard never had a reason to complain of Roose, he never trusted him either.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Eddard Stark had never had any reason to complain</strong> of the Lord of the
  Dreadfort, so far as Jon knew, but <strong>even so he had never trusted him</strong>,
  with his whispery voice and his pale, pale eyes<br><sub><strong><em>ADWD - Jon VII</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And also note, Roose doesn't feel like normal people do so let's not assume he hates the Starks. Lady Barbrey Dustin knows him as well as any other person can. She is his former sister-in-law and ally. This is what she says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Roose has no feelings, you see. Those leeches that he loves so well sucked all the passions out of him years ago. He does not love, he
  does not hate, he does not grieve.</strong> This is a game to him, mildly
  diverting. Some men hunt, some hawk, some tumble dice. Roose plays
  with men. You and me, these Freys, Lord Manderly, his plump new wife,
  even his bastard, we are but his playthings<br><sub><strong>ADWD - Prince of Winterfell</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is said over and over again how Roose strikes others as cold and lost to all emotions. So no, Roose probably doesn't hate the Starks. The opportunity was there to rise, he grabbed it and that required him to eliminate the Starks. </p>

<p>Nothing personal, just good business. </p>

<p>So in conclusion:</p>

<ol>
<li>Stark-Bolton enmity is not something new.</li>
<li>Boltons have a royal history which should have encouraged them to be more than vassals to a great House. </li>
<li>There is no evidence of a Warm relationship between Eddard Stark and Roose Bolton. At the same time, there is no evidence of strained relations either. It was all a professional liege-vassal relationship which was built on duty, self-interests and some suspicion.</li>

"209057","How are the faces preserved in the Hall of Faces?","<p>When Arya is finally shown the Hall of Faces, she actually touches one of the faces; i.e., the faces aren't in a container with some kind of preservative (like formaldehyde).</p>

<p>I know that the bodies are ""cleaned"" shortly after death, but how are the faces kept preserved in open room afterwards? Is there any explanation or hint of how this is achieved?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","235732","<p><strong>It is some form of magic, but not fully explained.</strong></p>
<p>We know (from the books) the process of applying a new face involves drinking a potion, having your real face cut, and applying the new face. The wearer of the new face cannot tell the difference, but all features including scars and teeth are transferred. The wearer may also experience visions of the person the face once belonged to.</p>
<p>I would assume that since the application of the faces involves magic, their preservation involves magic as well. The faces seem to be &quot;revived&quot; by the blood of their new wearer.</p>
<p>Below is a long transcript of &quot;a girl&quot; (aka Arya) going through her first face change into the &quot;ugly little girl&quot;. While this scene does not make into the show, it is our most in-depth description of the process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Still as stone, she thought. She sat unmoving. <strong>The cut was quick, the blade sharp.</strong> By rights the metal should have been cold against her flesh, but it felt warm instead. She could feel the blood washing down her face, a rippling red curtain falling across her brow and cheeks and chin, and she understood why the priest had made her close her eyes. When it reached her lips the taste was salt and copper. She licked at it and shivered.</p>
<p>&quot;Bring me the face,&quot; said the kindly man. The waif made no answer, but she could hear her slippers whispering over the stone floor. To the girl he said, <strong>&quot;Drink this,&quot; and pressed a cup into her hand. She drank it down at once. It was very tart</strong>, like biting into a lemon. A thousand years ago, she had known a girl who loved lemon cakes. No, that was not me, that was only Arya.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Mummers change their faces with artifice,&quot; the kindly man was saying, &quot;and sorcerers use glamors, weaving light and shadow and desire to make illusions that trick the eye. These arts you shall learn, but what we do here goes deeper. Wise men can see through artifice, and glamors dissolve before sharp eyes, but the face you are about to don will be as true and solid as that face you were born with.</strong> Keep your eyes closed.&quot; She felt his fingers brushing back her hair. &quot;Stay still. This will feel queer. You may be dizzy, but you must not move.&quot;</p>
<p>Then came a tug and a soft rustling as the new face was pulled down over the old. The leather scraped across her brow, dry and stiff, but as her blood soaked into it, it softened and turned supple. Her cheeks grew warm, flushed. She could feel her heart fluttering beneath her breast, and for one long moment she could not catch her breath. Hands closed around her throat, hard as stone, choking her. Her own hands shot up to claw at the arms of her attacker, but there was no one there. A terrible sense of fear filled her, and she heard a noise, a hideous crunching noise, accompanied by blinding pain. A face floated in front of her, fat, bearded, brutal, his mouth twisted with rage. She heard the priest say, &quot;Breathe, child. Breathe out the fear. <strong>Shake off the shadows. He is dead. She is dead. Her pain is gone.</strong> Breathe.&quot;</p>
<p>The girl took a deep shuddering breath, and realized it was true. No one was choking her, no one was hitting her. Even so, her hand was shaking as she raised it to her face. Flakes of dried blood crumbled at the touch of her fingertips, black in the lantern light. She felt her cheeks, touched her eyes, traced the line of her jaw. &quot;My face is still the same.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is it? Are you certain?&quot;</p>
<p>Was she certain? <strong>She had not felt any change, but maybe it was not something you could feel.</strong> She swept a hand down across her face from top to bottom, as she had once seen Jaqen H'ghar do, back at Harrenhal. When he did it, his whole face had rippled and changed. When she did it, nothing happened.</p>
<p>&quot;It feels the same.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To you,&quot; said the priest. &quot;It does not look the same.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To other eyes, your nose and jaw are broken,&quot; said the waif. &quot;One side of your face is caved in where your cheekbone shattered, and half your teeth are missing.&quot;</p>
<p>She probed around inside her mouth with her tongue, but found no holes or broken teeth. <strong>Sorcery, she thought. I have a new face. An ugly, broken face.</strong></p>

<p>It's worth noting that Jaime no longer trusts or believes in her anymore which is also probably part of the reason here. He doesn't believe her that she is pregnant and seems to have officially given up on her so whilst she didn't have him killed on the spot she's thought about it more now and wants him gone.

Her shaky authority and her heretical actions put her in danger. In ""Baelor"", Jorah said things to the effect of:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This isn't Westereos where men honor blood. Here they only honor strength. There will be fighting here after Drogo dies. Whoever wins that fight will be the new Khal. He won't want any rivals. Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs.</p>

</blockquote>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","142925","<h3>What happens when a Grand Maester is murdered</h3>
<p>This isn't the first time that Grand Maester was executed by the Monarch or ruling authority. King Maegor had three Grand Maesters executed in his brief reign alone. There is list of precedent for that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Grand Maester <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Gawen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gawen</a>: Executed by King Maegor, for speaking in favor of ascension of Prince Aegon (Son of Aenys I) to the throne, by beheading.</li>
<li>Grand Maester <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Gerardys"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gerardys</a>: Fed by King Aegon II to his royal dragon, Sunfyre.</li>
<li>Grand Maester <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Hareth_(maester)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hareth</a>: Executed for treason by an unknown King.</li>
</ol>
<p>Everytime a Grand Maester was killed, Citadel did send a new one to the King. Citadel does not command any swords or soldiers so they can't possibly defy the royal commands or criticize the actions without fear of meeting the same fate.</p>
<p>The Citadel does object on dismissal of a Grand Maester however, there seem to have been no objections raised after their execution. From <em>ASOS, Tyrion XII</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Not at all, my lord. Thank the archmaesters of Oldtown, those who
wished to insist on Pycelle's restoration on the grounds that <strong>only
the Conclave may make or unmake a Grand Maester</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>Bloody fools, thought Tyrion. &quot;<strong>I seem to recall that Maegor the
Cruel's headsman unmade three with his axe<sup>1</sup></strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quite true,&quot; Varys said. &quot;And the second Aegon fed Grand Maester
Gerardys to his dragon.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not to mention, these objections were based on legal rights of the conclave, they weren't an act of defiance or criticism of the regime. E.g. That would be like a King taking a stream away from me and me saying &quot;But your Grace, your own Royal father granted that stream to me for perpetuity. That is my right as per the feudal contract&quot;. The hostile action would be &quot;Oh may others take you! You blackhearted rogue, you are no King of mine. I will not pay any taxes unless my stream is restored to me&quot;. See the difference?</p>
<p>Anyhow every time the execution happened, the Citadel chose a new one and sent him forth which is evident by the fact that Maegor executed three of consecutive grand Maesters which implies that three must have been sent to him as replacement of the previously executed one.</p>
<h3>Will Citadel be reluctant?</h3>
<p>By precedent, it is unlikely.</p>
<p>However, it is not as simple as historic cases here.</p>
<p>Cersei's rule is <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/133037/can-cersei-lannister-claim-the-iron-throne-and-legitimize-her-act/133040#133040"">currently unrecognized</a> by most <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/133169/where-do-the-regions-of-westeros-appear-to-align-as-of-the-season-6-finale/133170#133170"">powerful lords of seven Kingdoms</a>.</p>
<p>Citadel is located in Old Town, which is under suzreinity of Tyrells of High Garden. Seeing as Tyrells have raised their banners in favor of Daenerys, it is very likely that Citadel may not send a new Grand Maester to Cersei and refuse to recognize her as the Queen given that they are now protected by the might of High Garden, something which wasn't true back in the day of the Dragon Kings.</p>
<p>Remember, one of the titles of Lord Hightower of Oldtown is <em>Defender of the Citadel</em>. Since his overlords, The Tyrells of High Garden are in open rebellion<sup>2</sup>, it appears to be unlikely that Citadel, emboldened by protection of Hightowers and Tyrells would send a Grand Maester to King's Landing.</p>
<h3>A symbol of legitimacy and its impacts on Tyrell goals</h3>
<p>Being served by Grand Maester is a sign of legitimacy and providing that to Cersei instead of Daenerys would be detrimental to Tyrell goals here.</p>
<p>From <em>The Princess and the Queen</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Every visible symbol of legitimacy belonged to Aegon</strong>. He sat the Iron
Throne. He lived in the Red Keep. He wore the Conquerer’s crown,
wielded the Conquerer’s sword, and had been anointed by a septon of
the Faith before the eyes of tens of thousands. <strong>Grand Maester Orwyle
sat in his councils</strong>, and the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard had
placed the crown upon his princely head. And he was male, which in the
eyes of many made him the rightful king, his half sister the usurper.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p><sub>1. Tyrion appears to be wrong in his memories here. At least Gawen was executed by the King himself with Blackfyre, not by his Axeman.</sub>
<br>
<sub>2. As far as Tyrells are concerned, they are in rebellion. They have sent forces to Daenerys. Cersei isn't that much of an idiot to delude herself that Tyrells will accept her rule after her murder of Lord Tyrell and his children. Daenerys isn't going to waste her time in stopping for camps. She has to reach her destination fast and strike hard, due to rules of logistics. Tyrells don't even need to hide their rebellion as Cersei's rule is unrecognized by great lords and there is no danger from the remnants of Lannister army, battered and tired from a long war.</sub></p>

<p>Bronn is an amoral and selfish sellsword. When is introduced to the story, he is a freerider more interested in his own comfort and gold than whether others simply live. Much later in the story, he admitted the only reason he saved Jaime Lannister from a dragon's breath was so that Jaime could stay alive until Bronn got his castle from the Lannisters.</p>
<p>He is not moved by claims of honor, so a trial by combat over the rights and honors of hated dwarf of a hated family should hold no appeal to him.

<p>Both outcomes have very negative outcomes for him. Neither outcome of the trial has a positive outcome.</p>

<p>“The thing is, you did not know the Starks. Lord Eddard is a proud, honorable, and honest man, and his lady wife is worse. Oh, no doubt she would have found a coin or two for you when this was all over, and pressed it in your hand with a polite word and a look of distaste, but that’s the most you could have hoped for. The Starks look for courage and loyalty and honor in the men they choose to serve them, and if truth be told, you and Chiggen were lowborn scum.”...</p>
<p>My pardons … but you are scum, Bronn, make no mistake. Duty, honor, friendship, what’s that to you? No, don’t trouble yourself, we both know the answer. Still, you’re not stupid. Once we reached the Vale, Lady Stark had no more need of you … but I did, and the one thing the Lannisters have never lacked for is gold. When the moment came to toss the dice, I was counting on your being smart enough to know where your best interest lay. Happily for me, you did.”...</p>
<p>“Scum you may be, but you’re undeniably useful, and with a sword in your hand you’re almost as good as my brother Jaime. What do you want, Bronn? Gold? Land? Women? Keep me alive, and you’ll have it.” Bronn blew gently on the fire, and the flames leaped up higher. “And if you die?” “Why then, I’ll have one mourner whose grief is sincere,” Tyrion said, grinning. “The gold ends when I do.”</p>

"209550","Why isn't everyone flabbergasted about Bran's ""gift""?","<p>Bran has become the three-eyed raven, and can see anything that has happened in history using his mind's eye. This is an incredible gift that takes place in a world in which people doubt the existence of dragons, giants, and white walkers.</p>

<p>People are a bit confused when they learn about Bran's gift, or seem a bit annoyed by his oddness, but are otherwise not too bothered. They react to Bran's gift as if they had just seen an unusually large goat.</p>

<p>This really came to the forefront in season 8. Bran claims in front of a large audience including Daenerys that the night king has breached the wall and has one of her dragons. He later speaks in front of the war council in Episode 2, during which many people are present,
some who barely know Bran. He speaks of the night king and being the three-eyed raven and the end of the world etc., and no one seems especially concerned. </p>

<p>We have no indication that these individuals are even aware of Bran's gift, let alone why they're so comfortable with it. They also acknowledge his visions and use them to dictate their plans. If I was in the room I would be saying: WAIT, what is he talking about, how does he know these things, how can we believe him, and why aren't we more curious about this super wizard? </p>

<p>Why isn't everyone flabbergasted about Bran's ""gift""? This is unlike anything anyone has ever encountered and is beyond comprehension, yet no one seems particularly perturbed.</p>

<p>I'm using the word ""flabbergasted"", but I'm also curious why people aren't more interested, questioning, curious, surprised, affected, etc.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","209558","<p>Who in Winterfell at this point would be flabbergasted by Bran's gifts?</p>

<p>The free men from beyond the wall are all familiar with magic, such as some people having gifts to allow them to take control of animals.</p>

<p>And Northmen by way of their religion are even more likely to be believers in magic and particularly greenseers. Just look at Jojen Reed.</p>

<p>Add to this that Bran Stark is a Lord of Winterfell and therefore more likely to be believed than a commoner, and I think it would be more strange for people not to believe him at this point.</p>

<p>But why is that? As far as I can see, it's got a single way down with lots of steps and poorly lit. If the dead win, the people there will be slaughtered with no way out. In any other place, they would have a chance to run at least. </p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","209563","<p>It is the safest place while the battle rages on, similar to the Battle of Helm's Deep in LOTR: while in the crypt/cave, the non-combatant are out of harms way, and in no risk of being hit by a stray projectile or shrapnel.

"143176","Where did the allegiance of Baratheon swords lie and why aren't they bulk of Royal Forces?","<p>I am just generally confused about the Baratheon army during season 1 and 2 of Game of Thrones. As far as we know there isn't a single Baratheon troop in King's landing during season 1. We see that the royal escort in episode 1 is backed by the Lannister troops. Even Joffrey's sworn shield, The Hound, is from a house that is sworn to the Lannisters.</p>

<p>As Robert is dying however, Renly tells Ned that he can have one hundred swords at his command by nightfall. Are we meant to believe that he was referring to the city watch? Beric Dondarrion attends court at Kingslanding so we know that there were more than zero Baratheon soldiers in the Crownlands.</p>

<p>In Season Two it appears that all of the Baratheon troops have declared for Stannis,the defending force at Blackwater is made up entirely of Lannisters and there are no longer any Baratheons fighting for Joffrey.</p>

<p>Why was the Crowns force made up of Lannisters and not Bartheons?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><laws>","143193","<h3>Robert's acts after his Coronation</h3>

<p>When Robert became King, he issued two edicts:</p>

<ol>
<li>Grant of Storms's End and Paramount Lordship of ancestral Baratheon lands (Stormlands) to Renly Baratheon.</li>
<li>Grant of Dragonstone and it's incomes and lands to Stannis Baratheon.</li>
</ol>

<p>By these acts:</p>

<ol>
<li>He separated the senior Branch of House Baratheon as House Baratheon of King's Landing. </li>
<li>He laid foundation of a cadet dynasty, House Baratheon of Storm's End.</li>
<li>He laid foundation of another cadet dynasty, House Baratheon of Dragonstone.</li>
</ol>

<p>So for all intents and purposes, House Baratheon of King's Landing was now a symbol of unity of the Kingdoms and had nothing to do with Stormlands at all as the Lords of Stormlands were now sworn to Renly Baratheon. That does not mean that Robert didn't have his own contingent of Stormlander sworn swords, who were sworn directly to the crown, not to Renly. </p>

<h3>Escort in Episode 1</h3>

<p>You are wrong when you suggest that the escort was made entirely of Lannister soldiers. The ones leading the escort were Baratheon men at arms, holding banners of the King while the Lannisters behind them were flying colors of House Lannister. Take a look below:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/X6QnO.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/X6QnO.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>As you can see, Baratheon soldiers are leading the party. If it is still not easy to differentiate, see this close up, Baratheon soldier in front and Lannister man behind:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/meVwD.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/meVwD.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Moreover, Baratheon men with antlers on their helms formed the line on gates before the Royals entered the castle proper with King's guards. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YoAH.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YoAH.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>More Baratheon soldiers spilled in with the King, pushing aside the Stark men who were standing on the left side of the gate and took positions:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iv7dq.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iv7dq.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>You can see the full video <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVVgASDz8pM"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>. </p>

<p>Lannister men in the escort are due to alliance between the Lion and the stag. Lord Tywin Lannister had 100+ soldiers given to Cersei presumably when she married Robert, to act as her guards and obey her every command. In Books, their captain is <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Vylarr"" rel=""noreferrer"">Vylarr</a>, in show his name is not mentioned. </p>

<p>In the books the escort is described as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The visitors poured through the castle gates in a <strong>river of gold</strong>
  and silver and polished steel, three hundred strong, a pride of
  bannermen and knights, of sworn swords and freeriders. Over their
  heads <strong>a dozen golden banners whipped back</strong> and forth in the
  northern wind, <strong>emblazoned with the crowned stag of Baratheon</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The golden color is the chosen color for livery of Baratheon men at arms. </p>

<h3>Why is Sandor sworn shield of Joffrey?</h3>

<p>The Hound left his ancestral keep when his brother succeeded his father, never to return. He went to Casterly Rock who accepted his service. Later he went to King's Landing, presumably on orders of Lord Tywin since Hound was sworn to him and wasn't likely to take orders from someone else. </p>

<p>Prince Joffrey was quite fond of Sandor Clegane. It isn't mentioned how did Hound become his sworn shield but I would speculate that it was due to insistence of the Prince himself. This is further reinforced when Joff dismisses Barristan Selmy so that Hound could take his place as King's Guard. </p>

<h3>What did Renly mean by 100 swords?</h3>

<p>By Hundred Swords, Renly didn't mean he was reforming the Watch. He didn't have many soldiers himself except a small guards retinue, as his power was in Storm's End, not King's landing. He meant to assemble guards retinues from his friends like Ser Loras Tyrell and give their command to Eddard, if he agrees to act against Cersei and her children. Lord Eddard however refused and Renly saw no choice but to flee.</p>

<p>He didn't have 100 swords however. Following is how the event happened in Season 1 Episode 7:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Eddard:</strong> Is Lord Renly joining us? </p>
  
  <p><strong>Varys:</strong> I fear Lord Renly has left the city. <strong>He rode through the old gate an hour before dawn with Ser Loras Tyrell and some 50
  retainers</strong>. Last seen galloping South in some haste.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the books, this is how the event transpired:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Left the city?"" Ned had counted on Renly's support.</p>
  
  <p>""<strong>He took his leave through a postern gate an hour before dawn,
  accompanied by Ser Loras Tyrell and some fifty retainers</strong>,"" Varys
  told them. ""When last seen, they were galloping south in some haste,
  no doubt bound for Storm's End or Highgarden.""</p>
  
  <p>So much for Renly and his hundred swords.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Why was Beric Dondarrion there?</h3>

<p>Beric Dondarrion was there for the Hand's Tourney and just happened to be in the court when Ned gave him command to kill the Mountain. If that hadn't happened, he would have returned to his seat at Black Haven in Dornish Marches. </p>

<h3>Why are crown's forces made up of Lannisters?</h3>

<p>That isn't true. King's Landing's defense is responsibility of the Gold cloaks aka city watch. There is a small contingent of Lannister guards however under command of the Queen. </p>

<p>The Baratheon men may have deserted in wake of King Robert's death and escape of Lord Renly. </p>

<p>In any case, it was the City Watch, aided by Lannister guards who defended the city against Baratheons when Stannis attacked, at least in the books. In the show, The role of city watch in the defense is given very little air time (If any). </p>

<p>The Crown's Forces are made up of:</p>

<ol>
<li>Gold Cloaks. Any Westerosi can join the Gold Cloaks however, most of them are locals of King's Landing. </li>
<li>The levies drawn from Lords of Crownlands who are direct vassals to the King. </li>
</ol>

<p>If Robert were to dismiss the traditional Royal force and recruit a force of Stormlanders, that would be like Targaryens dismissing the Kingslanders and getting people from Dragonstone to KL to serve them which would hurt the balance of power in different regions of Westeros. If Robert is to be seen as the King, he has to act like a King. Which means, holding on to Crownlands for his power and never showing particular favor to one Kingdom, even if it is his own origin. </p>

<p>The Lannister guards aren't official part of the Crown's swords. They are rather the Queen's swords. </p>

<h3>Where was Baratheon Army when they declared for Stannis?</h3>

<p>It wasn't Baratheon Army per se. It was rather Stormlander Army, sworn to House Baratheon of Storm's End and its lord Renly Baratheon.</p>

<p>The Baratheon Army was on outskirts of Storm's End then. Stannis had surprised Renly by laying siege to Storm's End instead of King's Landing. Renly rode with his Army, made of Tyrells and Baratheon sworn Lords to defeat Stannis. Stannis however had Renly killed by sorcery. The Tyrells fled as they had no reason to fight for Stannis, unlike Renly who was married to Margaery. </p>

<p>The Stormlords however had no choice but to declare for Stannis. Where were they to go except to the last Baratheon? That's how Stannis got the command of Stormlander aka Baratheon army. </p>

<h3>How Much say do soldiers get?</h3>

<p>None. Soldiers don't choose who they fight for. They fight for their own local Landed Knights, Lords and Lords Paramount. They are normally peasants who answer the call when their liege calls for them and follow him into the battle. It is the lords who choose who will they fight for. </p>

<p>The administrative ranking is:</p>

<ol>
<li>King</li>
<li>Lord Paramount</li>
<li>Major Lord</li>
<li>Minor Lord</li>
<li>Landed Knight</li>
<li>Peasant</li>
</ol>

<p>The administrative structure is like this:</p>

<pre><code> 1. King
     1. Lord Paramount
         1. Major Lord
             1. Minor Lord
                 1. Landed Knight
                     1. Peasant
                 2. Peasant
             2. Landed Knight
                 1. Peasant
             3. Peasant
         2. Minor Lord
             1. Landed Knight
                 1. Peasant
             2. Peasant
         3. Landed Knight
             1. Peasant
         4. Peasant
     2. Major Lord
         1. Minor Lord
             1. Landed Knight
                 1. Peasant
             2. Peasant
         2. Landed Knight
            1. Peasant
         3. Peasant
     3. Minor Lord
         1. Landed Knight
             1. Peasant
         2. Peasant
     4. Landed Knight
         1. Peasant
     5. Peasant 
</code></pre>

<p>Landed Knights can call their peasants to arms either by themselves or by command of their liege minor lords. Minor lords can also do that except that their commands come from their liege major lords. Same is true of Major lords except that their commands come from their liege Lords Paramount. Lords Paramount answer to no one except the King. </p>

<p>So the Baratheon soldiers didn't quiet have a choice between the three. The Baratheon men in Dragonstone followed Stannis, Baratheon men in Storm's End followed Renly.</p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><inspiration>","143251","<p>No that is just a coincidence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well… In 1981 I wrote a novel with Lisa Tuttle called Windhaven. In fact, we wrote three different short stories with the same main character, Maris, and once we had them written we decided to put them all into one book with three different parts. So while we were writing the books we thought about a dwarf who would have been the Lord of one of the islands. He had to be the ugliest person in the world but the most intelligent too. I kept that idea in my mind and it reappeared to me when I was starting to write Game of Thrones. <strong>So…That’s Tyrion Lannister</strong>.</p>

  <p>Westeros is at the mercy of erratic seasons that may last for many

  many fear that an equally long and harsh winter will follow. It is
  unclear to which degree the eastern continent is subject to the same
  conditions. George R. R. Martin explicitly and more than once stated
  that the explanation of the Planet's climate will be revealed at the
  end of the series, so he cannot disclose any further details on the
  issue before that point. He also stated that the explanation will be

"209637","Are there other sources of air in the crypt of Winterfell?","<p>When fire burns it removes oxygen and gives out carbon dioxide (among other gases) this means that if a fire burns in a confined space it quickly becomes fatal to humans to be in the space even if the fire is under control. The fact that torches are always seen to be burning in the crypt suggests that either the door is always open and provides enough fresh air to keep the torches burning without causing a risk to health, or there are other forms of ventilation such as vents to the surface etc.</p>

<p>Has it been shown in the TV series, in the books, or the various source books (e.g. any plans of Winterfell) that there is additional ventilation in the crypt? If the refugees lock themselves in the crypt what will stop them from suffocating?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","209647","<p>There are none mentioned that I know of. All we hear of is the main door into the crypts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The door to the crypts was made of ironwood. It was old and heavy, and lay at a slant to the ground. Only one person could approach it at a time. Osha tried once more when she reached it, but Bran could see that it was not budging. &quot;Let Hodor try.&quot;</p>
<p><sub><em>A Clash of Kings</em>, Bran VII</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's worth noting that Winterfell has hollow walls, or at least piped walls, where hot spring water runs through and so if the engineers (Brandon the Builder) thought about that they probably thought about ventilation in the crypts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of all the rooms in Winterfell's Great Keep, Catelyn's bedchambers were the hottest. She seldom had to light a fire. <strong>The castle had been built over natural hot springs, and the scalding waters rushed through its walls and chambers like blood through a man's body</strong>, driving the chill from the stone halls, filling the glass gardens with a moist warmth, keeping the earth from freezing. Open pools smoked day and night in a dozen small courtyards. That was a little thing, in summer; in winter, it was the difference between life and death.</p>
<p><sub><em>A Game of Thrones</em>, Catelyn II</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We also know that Bran and co managed to survive in the crypts when Theon took it and so there must be some sort of ventilation down there otherwise that would not have been possible. Of course we're talking about different volumes here but the principle is the same.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The legs, I could tell... the clothes fit, but the muscles in his legs... poor lad...&quot; He coughed, and blood came up from inside him. &quot;You vanished... in the woods... how, though?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We never went,&quot; said Bran. &quot;Well, only to the edge, and then doubled back. I sent the wolves on to make a trail, but we hid in Father's tomb.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The crypts.&quot; Luwin chuckled, a froth of blood on his lips. When the maester tried to move, he gave a sharp gasp of pain.</p>
<p><sub><em>A Clash of Kings</em>, Bran VII</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lastly, we know of an underground town, Mole's Town, and I don't think there's mention of ventilation down there except for the main entrance. Again, considering people live down there, it is safe to assume there is some form of ventilation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mole's Town was bigger than it seemed, but three quarters of it was under the ground, in deep warm cellars connected by a maze of tunnels. Even the whorehouse was down there, nothing on the surface but a wooden shack no bigger than a privy, with a red lantern hung over the door. On the Wall, he'd heard men call the whores &quot;buried treasures.&quot; He wondered whether any of his brothers in black were down there tonight, mining. That was oathbreaking too, yet no one seemed to care.</p>

<p>Personally I think this would have been a great opportunity for Martin to throw in a twist to the readers, but I just don't know how he'd do it now. What I thought when I read it originally was that the mother made her daughter abort her baby, no. I thought that wasn't her daughter, Jaime has probably never met Jeyne before and no one (of importance to the situation) would be the wiser. </p>

<p>When they changed the character Jeyne Westerling to Talisa Maegry in the show, then killed her off I was wondering what would happen in the books. I know that they are two different things but they can't have something major like Jeyne actually being pregnant happen in the books but not the show.</p>

"210734","Why are the Night King and his minions advancing now versus later in winter?","<p>Winter may be several years long, which is effectively a natural siege in itself. Why not simply wait a year or two for the people of Westeros south of the Wall to be starving and worn down, versus attacking relatively soon after winter begins?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","210780","<p>There are 2 theories that are linked to this that I have seen, neither has been confirmed. I have my own theory as well.  </p>

<p>Theory 1 :- The White Walkers are the cause of this long winter and it can only spread across Westeros as they move across the land, this would mean that if they stop and wait the winter actually wont be so bad in the more southern parts of Westeros allowing people to prepare, grow more food etc. </p>

<p>Theory 2:- The White Walkers come with the winter, moving with the cold and the dark like animals migrating with the sun. It may be that the White Walkers are more like Animals then people and act largely on instinct. They understand that a big winter is coming and so are driven to move with it understanding it will allow them to go to lands they could not travel to normally because it is to hot. In the books we have only seen the White Walkers in darkness, they seem to be averse to light, even avoiding moonlight. The TV show ignores this, largely because it is really hard to make it clear what is happening in night shot scenes. It could well be that as the nights get longer the white walkers are simply moving taking there wights etc with them. </p>

<p>Theory 3 (my theory) The Night King had his hand forced by Jon Snow, he understands that by taking the wight the people of the 7 kingdoms will now see the myths are true and start preparing, so he needs to attack now before they have time to prepare, ironically Jon's actions at the frozen lake hastened the attack of the Night King it might also be a case that everyone north of the wall is dead, so there are no more people to fill his armies, if people know the night king is coming body's in Westeros will be burned as a matter of course reducing the number of corpses that can be raised.  </p>

<p>With news of the battle spreading, surely other houses would want that kind of power for themselves? Is lack of usage of wildfire due to some prohibition in the Faith of The Seven?</p>

<p>I haven't read the books, but maybe this is different compared to the TV show.</p>

<p>It doesn't seem realistic that the Alchemist Guild is able to keep the secret to the creation of wildfire.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","210977","<p><strong>TL;DR - Wildfire is difficult to produce and very volatile.</strong></p>

<p>Wildfire is created by Alchemists Guild which is a secret they posses alone. Their order is no longer prevalent in Westeros and the remaining members seem to be in King's Landing alone. This is the first reason why other houses do not use it.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The substance was the pyromancers' own term for wildfire. They called each other wisdom as well, which Tyrion found almost as annoying as their custom of hinting at the vast secret stores of knowledge that they wanted him to think they possessed. Once theirs had been a powerful guild, but in recent centuries the maesters of the Citadel had supplanted the alchemists almost everywhere. <strong>Now only a few of the older order remained</strong>, and they no longer even pretended to transmute metals...</p>
  
  <p>...but they could make wildfire.</p>
  
  <p><sub><em>A Clash of Kings - Tyrion V</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Guild created the Wildfire under the direction of the Targaryen's namely ""The Mad King"" Aerys II (<a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Wildfire_plot"" rel=""noreferrer"">see the Wildfire Plot</a>) which was then hidden underneath the city. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""There is a vault below this one where we store the older pots. Those from King Aerys's day. It was his fancy to have the jars made in the shapes of fruits. <strong>Very perilous fruits indeed</strong>, my lord Hand, and, hmmm, riper now than ever, if you take my meaning. We have sealed them with wax and pumped the lower vault full of water, but even so . . . by rights they ought to have been destroyed, <strong>but so many of our masters were murdered during the Sack of King's Landing, the few acolytes who remained were unequal to the task.</strong> And much of the stock we made for Aerys was lost. Only last year, two hundred jars were discovered in a storeroom beneath the Great Sept of Baelor. No one could recall how they came there, but I'm sure I do not need to tell you that the High Septon was beside himself with terror. I myself saw that they were safely moved. I had a cart filled with sand, and sent our most able acolytes. </p>
  
  <p><sub><em>A Clash of Kings - Tyrion V</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That secret involves spells that only the Alchemist's know and even for them it is difficult:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""We were, my lord Hand, my brothers and I have been laboring day and night from the first, I assure you. It is only, hmmm, we have made so much of the substance that we have become, hmmm, more practiced as it were, and also""—the alchemist shifted uncomfortably—<strong>""certain spells, hmmm, ancient secrets of our order, very delicate, very troublesome, but necessary if the substance is to be, hmmm, all it should be...""</strong></p>
  
  <p><sub><em>A Clash of Kings - Tyrion XI</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cersei initially found these stores and then Tyrion recruited the Guild to make more for Battle of Blackwater. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The pyromancers kept their recipe for wildfire a closely guarded secret, but Tyrion knew that it was a lengthy, dangerous, and time-consuming process.</strong> He had assumed the promise of ten thousand jars was a wild boast, like that of the bannerman who vows to marshal ten thousand swords for his lord and shows up on the day of battle with a hundred and two. If they can truly give us ten thousand . . .
  He did not know whether he ought to be delighted or terrified. Perhaps a smidge of both. ""I trust that your guild brothers are not engaging in any unseemly haste, Wisdom. We do not want ten thousand jars of defective wildfire, nor even one . . . and we most certainly do not want any mishaps.""</p>

<p>The second reason other houses do not use it is (as seen in the above quotes) a, Wildfire is time consuming and dangerous to make and has a shelf life. Once you have some, it may not work as you intend it to either, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An arrow could be aimed, and a spear, even the stone from a catapult, but wildfire had a will of its own. Once loosed, it was beyond the control of mere men. </p>

<p>Jaime also agrees with that assessment</p>

<p>So if a another house wanted it use it, they would first have to hire the Alchemists Guild, which I'm sure during the Targaryen and Lannister reign would not have been taken kindly to. Next the would have to wait quite a long time for large enough store to be effectively used in battle to be made. Finally, they would have to hope and pray they stored and handled it properly without killing themselves. </p>

<p>Wildfire was Tyrion's last ditch effort to protect the city.</p>

"143646","How are the white Ravens Trained?","<p>At the turn of every season the Maesters of the Citadel send a white Raven to every Castle and Hold-fast in Westeros. This is how the people of Westeros know that it is officially a new season. However, I wish to know how the white Ravens are trained.</p>

<p>I say trained because, in the books a Maester, I believe it is Maester Kressen, mentions that most Ravens only fly to and from their home castle and one other castle. However, the Maester does mention that the more intelligent among their species can be trained to fly to more than one Castle. I tend to believe this means that the black ravens must be trained to become messengers, though I may be wrong.</p>

<p>So my question is, how do the Maesters train the white ravens without having a false alarm every time they make a practice journey?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","144021","<h3>Lack of Explicit info</h3>
<p>The answer is: <em>We do not know</em>.</p>
<p>There is no mention in the books about the training procedure for the ravens whether they be black or white.</p>
<p>So the following would be just speculation based on logic and canon evidence.</p>
<h3>Attaching a note to the bird</h3>
<p>Maesters can attach notes to the white birds to notify the recipients that it is a drill and not a herald of Winter's arrival.</p>
<p>In Westeros, Seasons are more fickle than sellswords or Ironborn.  For instance, see the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/281_AC"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">year of false Spring</a> when everyone thought that Winter was over when in fact it wasn't. So odd timing of arrival of a white raven alone won't lead to the conclusion that this may have been just a drill.</p>
<p>Which means that the maesters would have to explicitly communicate to the lord concerned that his castle may host a trainee bird. This can be done by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attaching a note to the White bird with explanation.</li>
<li>Notifying the lord via a black raven prior to the flight of the white raven so that the hosts are prepared to see the winter bird.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Meetings of Lords</h3>
<p>When winter is actually on the horizon, regional lords hold a summit with their overlords to decide what portion of the harvest is to be set aside as reserve for winter.</p>
<p>For example, in <em>ACOK</em>, we see Northern Lords or their representatives arriving in Winterfell for a Harvest feast where they asked the Starks about food provisions for the upcoming winter.</p>
<p>From <em>ACOK, Bran II</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bran soon realized that it was the steward, not Lady Glover, who truly
ruled at Deepwood Motte. <strong>The man allowed that he was at present
setting aside only a tenth of his harvest</strong>. A hedge wizard had told
him there would be a bountiful spirit summer before the cold set in,
he claimed. Maester Luwin had a number of choice things to say about
hedge wizards. <strong>Ser Rodrik commanded the man to set aside a fifth</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the same chapter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the morrow came, most of the morning was given over to talk of
grains and greens and salting meat. Once the maesters in their Citadel
had proclaimed the first of autumn, wise men put away a portion of
each harvest... though how large a portion was a matter that seemed to
require much talk. <strong>Lady Hornwood was storing a fifth of her harvest.
At Maester Luwin’s suggestion, she vowed to increase that to a
quarter.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So let's say even if a Lord was mistaken in actually believing that Winter was indeed coming for any reason, he would then send a delegation or a message to his overlord about the portion of harvest to be stored which would then confirm that Winter isn't actually coming.</p>
<h3>Local Maester</h3>
<p>Local Maesters themselves appear to keep record of seasons in addition to the records kept by the central Citadel in Old Town. For example, Maester Aemon kept his own readings of seasons and did not solely rely on readings of the citadel.</p>
<p>From <em>AGOT, Tyrion III</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Lord Commander did not seem amused. “You are not fool enough to
believe that, my lord. Already the days grow shorter. There can be no
mistake, <strong>Aemon has had letters from the Citadel, findings in accord
with his own</strong>. The end of summer stares us in the face.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So in event of receiving such a bird, local Maester might be able to figure out that it is just a drill even if there was no notification of that.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Obviously the news creates turbulence for Jon's love life and for his humble position as Warden of the North or whatever. And Jon seems literal-minded enough that I would expect him to treat this news as a Big Deal, he doesn't have much moral flexibility unlike Cersei or even Jaime or Sansa. So it makes sense to me that he freaks out as soon as he learns the news.</p>

<p>Why does <em>Bran</em> insist that Jon needs to know this news? Bran is insightful enough even without his Greensight to know that this news will only cause (really poorly-timed) drama. It's not like Jon secretly wishes he could have a higher station in life; this news can only complicate and darken his life, plus it will prolong Westeros' political instability. And Bran doesn't seem like the type to care much about</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> potential aunt/nephew incest, nor about whether his brother gets to be king or not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So why does Bran seem to feel urgency to make sure that Jon a) knows about, b) believes, and c) presumably does something about, this news?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","211090","<p>Bran is now the last <a href=""https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Greenseer"" rel=""noreferrer"">greenseer</a>, as the <a href=""https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Three-Eyed_Raven"" rel=""noreferrer"">Three Eyed Raven</a> was before him. This gives him the ability to perceive events in the past, present <strong>and future</strong>. </p>

<p>Although we as viewers will not know for sure until more episodes of the final season have screened, we can assume that in universe Bran has seen how his actions will influence later events and therefore he has seen that it's important for Jon Snow to learn about his heritage <em>now</em> so that later events (that will give Westeros a chance against the Night King) will come to pass. </p>

<p>For example, perhaps Jon's knowledge of his past will cause him to make different leadership decisions, adopt different battle strategies or will alter his relationship with Daenerys in a way that increases the chances of a better outcome in the long run.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>We do know that he can glimpse into the future since he became the Three Eyed Raven, so is there a possibility that he had seen this outcome?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","211180","<h1>No</h1>
<p>As opposed to @TheLethalCarrot's answer, I would say no. There is no evidence that Bran can see into the future. Bran has been seen to have visions of the future, but not the active ability to look into the future.</p>
<p>During the council of the Battle of Winterfell, Arya asks &quot;Dragon fire will stop him [the Night King]?&quot; and Bran responds, &quot;I don't know. No one's ever tried.&quot; We know Bran can actively see into the past and see anything happening in the present, but if he could actively see into the future, he would have seen Daenerys try to kill the Night King with Drogon.</p>
<p>So more likely, he did not know what would happen. He was calm because, as the Three Eyed Raven, his emotions have been dulled, if not completely nullified. In 'Inside the Episode' after the episode, when David Benioff says &quot;Bran knows what is going to happen,&quot; I believe he simply meant they both knew that Theon was going to die. Obviously, as he can not hope to kill the Night King alone.</p>
<p>To address the other answers and the possibility that Bran did see and know the outcome, it is entirely possible but in my view, very unlikely. The fact that he gave Arya the Cat's Paw dagger isn't really indicative of knowing she would use it to kill the Night King. It could be just as he said, &quot;It's wasted on a cripple&quot; and he knows Arya is a badass now, which seems more likely. And who else would he give it to? Jon, who already has a valyrian steel sword? Jaime, who pushed him out the window and only has one hand? Brienne, a person he doesn't know? Arya was the only person he knew who he could really even give it to, and the best suited for a valyrian steel dagger.</p>
<p>Also, for the argument that Bran is keeping information from other people so not to prevent said future from happening also seems unlikely. As we learned from Hodor's backstory, he became Hodor because of Bran's meddling in the past. But Hodor was already Hodor before Bran became the Three Eyed Raven. This suggests the world of Game of Thrones follows a fixed timeline and not a multiverse like the MCU. It seems unlikely to me that Bran would think his actions could make a difference to his future visions considering what he has seen.</p>
<p>It seem's more likely to me that if he were to, for example, see Jon die in his vision, he would go up to Jon and say &quot;You're going to die tomorrow. Love you bud.&quot; and roll away, although I'm not saying that's definitely true.</p>
<p>All in all, while it is entirely possible that Bran can and did see into the future and knew what would happen, there's no evidence to suggest that that is what happened. While it's completely possible Bran gave Arya the Cat's Paw dagger specifically to kill the Night King, until we have more information from the show or the creators/writers that that is true, we have to assume it is not.</p>

"211153","If Melisandre foresaw another character closing blue eyes, why did she follow Stannis?","<p>Melisandre came from Asshai to serve Lord Stannis. We were told that she did it because she believed he was the Azor Ahai who'd save humanity by slaying the encroaching darkness. She even forged (a fake) Lightbringer for him, the heroes' sword which presumably the last Azor Ahai used to bring down the hands behind the last Long Night.</p>

<p>She then met Arya Stark in Riverlands and foretold that Arya would close many eyes; brown eyes, green eyes, blue eyes. </p>

<p>In S08E03 she meets Arya again and says the same words.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Arya at once realises that she means that Arya had to close the Night King's blue eyes and at once set out to do that. </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> That Beric's only purpose for which the Lord of Light brought him back was protecting Arya during the battle so that she could kill the Night King.</p>

<p>So the question is, if she saw that:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Arya would be the one to kill Night King and is therefore the Azor Ahai she was looking for. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why did she follow Stannis at all? There is no indication that she ever doubted that Stannis was manifestation of Azor Ahai until his last breath.</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","211158","<p>The blue eyes comment when Melisandre met Arya in the Riverlands was most likely just a reference to the many people Arya would kill.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Note that Melisandre also mentions brown and green eyes without putting any particular emphasis on blue eyes.</p>

<p>If this was in fact a vision predicting Arya assassinating the Night King, then it's possible that Melisandre didn't grasp the importance of blue eyes in her vision.  As we've seen before, Melisandre doesn't always understand the true significance of her visions or interpret them correctly.</p>

<p>For example, in this vision Melisandre is seeking out Stannis:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I pray for a glimpse of Azor Ahai, and R'hllor shows me only snow.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many have interpreted this statement to refer to Jon Snow; however, if this is the case then Melisandre did not interpret it this way immediately.</p>

<p>Then, sometime before Season 8 Episode 3, Melisandre connects the dots and realizes the true importance of her vision.  This helps to motivate her to come back to Winterfell to encourage Arya to seek out the Night King.</p>

"211185","Why was the second line of the Battle for Winterfell comprised of catapults?","<p>I don't really understand why they had the second line using trebuchets and catapults instead of the last line next to the wall, so they could continue to fire.</p>

<p>Feels like it closes down the retreat path having them close to the wall but I don't know. Maybe someone can explain?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","211203","<p>There was a lot I found wrong with the episode but overall The tactics used here make perfect sense. </p>

<p>A catapult or Trebuchet has a long range but also has a minimum range due to the way it throws its payload into the air. This means that within a certain distance the enemy is safe from attack. </p>

<p>Catapults and trebuchets are also imprecise so once the armies clash firing would need to stop in order to prevent friendly fire. </p>

<p>Now if the catapults has been placed at the base of the wall behind they would have filled the space between the wall and the fire pit but would have not been able to hit the dead at all. This would have then created problems for the defenders, the unsullied defensive formation relies on them being positioned as a solid unit. You see this in the way they retreat the central soldiers fall back as the formation narrows down (this was one of the best looking scenes of the episode). if they are forced to retreat amongst fixed wooden structures such as catapults this creates small groups that can be picked off piece by piece and makes it harder to fight. Also if the artillery is near the wall it can be easily used to climb up the walls.</p>

<p>The only other tactic with artillary is to place it far far behind the battle but that tactic suits open battle not a defensive action where the aim is to protect a fixed position. </p>

<p>The tactic I don’t understand was the use of the dolthraki. I would have held them back out the way and used them once the army of the dead had reached the castle to attack the rear catching the army between the castle walls and themselves. Charging them off on there own looked great but was always a waste of soldiers.!</p>

I worked half a hundred spells and brightened the red time and time again, but always the color would darken, as if the blade was drinking the sun from it. And some folds would not take the red at all, as you can see. If my lords of Lannister are displeased, I will of course try again, as many times as you should require, but—&quot;</p>

"211205","Why was the battle set up *outside* Winterfell?","<p>The whole point of building a castle is that it is an excellent defensive stronghold: the attackers need to climb walls, and the defenders have the high ground and can defend very efficiently using archers, oil, etc.</p>

<p>So what is the reason why the army of the living lined up just <em>outside</em> Winterfell in S08E03, rather than staying put inside the walls and fight as defenders in a siege? It would seem a strategically superior strategy, especially since they knew that the Night King had reasons to attack Bran specifically.</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","211228","<p>There are a couple of ways you can look at this, both from an in story explanation, as well as a real world application.</p>

<p>In story the purpose of the siege was to bait the Night King into entering the field of battle so ultimately the dragons could kill him.  Bran was used as bait because the Night King has a ridiculous need to kill him (if someone can explain, why exactly the NK needs to kill Bran, please do).  Basically the way the battle played out more or less worked as planned.  </p>

<p>Now there are a number of issues here with doctrine in a fight (how battles are actually fought in this equivalent time period), and the Strategy and Tactics taken.  Just a quick aside Strategy is a long term goal, like a campaign strategy and why some battles need to be fought, and tactics are short term, move this unit here for this reason.  Example being, a tactic is to order a tank division to hold a bridge, the strategy being forcing the enemy to move forces from the east to the west because of less ways to traverse a feature, in this instance the river.</p>

<p>This is going to get really long...  so I'm just going to do a quick dirty on what the defenders did wrong and how they wouldn't really make those mistakes if they were suited to leading men in battle, and an explanation on how it would be done, both with knowing and not knowing the enemy.</p>

<p>What was done wrong:</p>

<p><strong>Dothraki Leading the Charge:</strong>
The defenders don't know the abilities of the White Walkers in open battle, while the thinking here is that the Dothraki are probably the best units in the entire series, and definitely the best on open fields, they are incredibly poorly suited to the role of running down an advancing army.  The Dothraki often use speed and violence of action, charging into ill-prepared Armys and terrifying them off the field quickly.  The White Walkers aren't people, and most of the planners of the battle knew this, this was a major blunder.  Also the Dothraki cut through lines, if they are facing an attacking army, there is no line to cut through and get to the other side.
These guys are loosely based on Mongolian Horse back warriors.  I say loosely because they completely forgot that it's not the Mongol sword that won them the largest land empire in history, it's the Mongol composite bow.  But the main Mongol tactic was to trick the enemy into thinking their numbers were smaller, drawing advancing enemies into thinking their lines were breaking, and then as the enemies advanced into being surrounded the Mongols would shoot them with arrows until they died.  Near the ends of battles the Mongols often left breaks in their encirclement, letting the enemy think they had a way to escape, and then they would run them down and butcher them as they were tired.  Be like the Mongols, not the Dothraki.  Dothraki operated ultimately on fear, useless against White Walkers.</p>

<p><strong>The Defenders never ranged their ""Artillery"":</strong>  The trebuchet and catapult were never ranged, and <strong><em>THEY ONLY FIRED THEM ONCE</em></strong>.  Oh, and they placed them essentially on the front lines, near the castle walls/inside the walls/behind Winterfell all would have been better positions.  They would have been ranged and they would have known exactly how to fire each one to hit exact positions, so they could have been used in the midst of fighting.</p>

<p><strong>Combining troop types on the same line with same conditions:</strong>  This sounds odd to you, but the Unsullied holding the left and the Northmen holding the right is ultimately stupid.  The Unsullied are the best for holding a defensive position, they should have held the line and immediate flanks.  The Northmen operate more as skirmishers, heavy unmounted knights.  They would be best used to fill gaps, cover the extreme flanks, etc...  They'd have no issue continuing a line, but wouldn't be able to stop an advance.  Also these would be the first troops you want back in your castle during a retreat.  Holding a wall doesn't require a shield, the wall is your shield.</p>

<p><strong>Where are the Archers:</strong>  Why aren't mass quantities of arrows being poured into this completely unarmored Army?</p>

<p><strong>Why do the walls not getting defended after the field fell?:</strong>  This goes along with how poorly Winterfel is designed.  Number one men should be on the walls to repel climbers, archers should be in the towers to provide fire on opposing walls.  <strong>Yes opposing walls</strong> they should know that star shaped fortification have been en vogue forever, so defenders don't have to expose themselves to fire down their walls, they simply fire on the walls across from them they can see.  Winterfel doesn't have this, because siege warfare isn't a thing in Westeros I suppose.  No Oil to pour on hapless White Walkers, no murder hatches...  If you are interested, just research what goes in to attacking a fortified structure, and the defenses thought of through the years.  That's why siege's are usually done in a waiting for a year outside your walls manner.</p>

<p>And the biggest sin:
<strong>Why is there no plan for fall back points and defenses?</strong>  Real defenses have fall back points, and contingency fall back points.  Castles have Keeps, even if the castle walls fall, Keeps can be sealed essentially tight and are extremely difficult to get into.  There are stories in history of sections of walled cities and castles falling, while other sections are still held, it's that difficult to get from one area to another.  This was never done by the Defenders.</p>

<p>How this would have played out:  In the days leading up to the battle, skirmishing parties of militia men, recon, wildlings would have been sent out to engage and harass the enemy to slow their advance and determine how they are ultimately going to fight.  The people I mentioned are ultimately easily expendable because they don't really fit a mold of the type of troop needed to defend a castle.
Considering they wouldn't have learned the white walkers abilities until days before battle, the outer defenses created would still likely be the same, but they need to be bigger and more pronounced.  The trench dug would be deeper with more wood and more designed to stop a rush.  The artillery would have been placed in the yard and near the wall and ranged.  The unsullied would have been used to hold the whole line with the Northmen on the flanks and as reserve.  AFTER the white walker charge had been halted you would use your cavalry Dothraki to crash into their flanks endlessly, in and out.  They would attack enough to keep them from gaining forward momentum and thin them out, but no enough that they would and change angle of attack.  When the field lines broke and retreating within the walls was needed, the Northmen would go first, the Dothraki would be told to break off and constantly attack at the rear of the White walkers, basically run around and pillage the country side, but pillage for enemies obviously.
Once inside the walls the Northmen would be on the walls to repel climbers, while the remaining unsullied would be at strategic hardpoints, the main entrance, travel ways between different parts of the castle, anywhere a line needs to be held.  Ultimately the plan would be to continual funnel the white walkers into pinch points, since the white walkers are useless at actually siegeing.</p>

<p>And, if the ""blue fire"" were to of touched Daenerys (or her dragons), would it cause damage?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","211264","<p>The blue fire that Vicerion breathes can melt the Wall and destroy the walls of Winterfell. As far as I know the closest we get to it touching Dany or one of the other dragons is when the Night King surprises them above the clouds. However, we never see it actually hit them.

<p>Dany is then a special case because whilst the pyre event to birth the dragons was meant to be a one time thing, the show extended it to just a characteristic of Dany so she might be fire proof to it. However, we don't know and dragon fire is something more than normal fire.</p>

<p>Drogon and Rhaegal probably have a deeper protection if not complete immunity to it as they breathe fire themselves and being harmed by what you create wouldn't make much sense.</p>

  <p> Arya killed the Night King</p>

<p>so what was the point of the prophecy? I thought Jon or Dany were the Prince That Was Promised. Can anyone explain?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","211240","<p>What's stopping Arya from being the Azor Ahai. She became Azor Ahai because she acted on the prophecy and made it true.</p>

<p>I can't talk about the Azor Ahai prophecy from the books as I haven't read them.</p>

<p>In the show, however, the prophecy, as told by Melisandre, goes like this</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Long Night is coming. Only the prince <em>[prince or princess, according to Missandei’s translation]</em> that was promised can bring the dawn … I believe you have a role to play, as does another. Summon Jon Snow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She also claims that prophecies are dangerous things and she has been wrong in interpreting them.</p>

<p>She first claims Stannis to be the Azor Ahai but upon his death, when she returns to Castle Black &amp; resurrects Jon Snow, she says to Davos that Jon is the Prince that was promised. But when Jon banishes her she goes to Daenerys &amp; tells the prophecy to her.   </p>

<p>In the show, at this point, Melisandre doesn't claims that Daenerys or Jon Snow is the ""Prince That Was Promised"". She only claims they have a role to play.</p>

<p>Back in season 3, Melisandre prophecises to Arya that she sees darkness in her &amp; in that darkness eyes staring back at her. Brown, green &amp; blue eyes she will shut forever and repeats it today because she can now correctly interprete the visions she saw in the flames.</p>

<p>Prophecises are that only, people who believe in them, act accordingly &amp; in turn make it true.   </p>

<p>It's the similar case in Harry Potter, Voldemort acted on a prophecy &amp; made Harry Potter the chosen one. If he didn't act on it &amp; try to kill Harry as child, that prophecy would be bullshit &amp; he would still be alive &amp; more powerful.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Like so many fundamentalists, she(Melisandre) saw a cataclysmic threat
  solely through the lens of her scripture, insisting it was being
  fulfilled chapter and verse, pointing to all the prophetic ""evidence""
  with the myopic, connect-the-dots-sheeple fervor of a conspiracy
  theorist.</p>
  
  <p>But prophecies and magic are a slippery business in Game of Thrones,
  both real and fallible, true and apocryphal. In that sense they are
  stories, and all stories are true in one sense or another—but what
  they tell us about our future depends not on what they say so much as
  what we decide that they mean.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Stannis was not Azor Ahai, after all, and the show remains agnostic on
  whether Arya's shanking of the Night King makes her the Princess Who
  Was Promised or just a kick-ass girl with a cool dagger at the right
  time. Sure, we can go back through the legend and find ways to connect
  Arya to passages about smoke and salt and blood—and sure, Valyrian
  steel was forged by dragonfire according to some accounts, so in that
  sense she was wielding a fiery blade. But if we can squint and make
  enough of the piece fit, does that mean a prophecy has been fulfilled
  or just that we've skillfully reimagined the outcome to line up with
  the story we expected to hear?</strong></p>
  
  <p>That's the thing about stories, the ones we tell both about ourselves
  and the world we live in; they're only useful insofar as they get us
  where we need to go, when they serve us and not the other way around.</p>

"143810","Why did Rhaegar take Lyanna to Dorne?","<p>Considering Rhaegar Targaryen was married to Elia Martell of Dorne, wasn't it rather stupid of him to take Lyanna Stark to the Tower of Joy, which is situated in the Red Mountains of Dorne? </p>

<p>Even considering the relatively free sexual norms in Dorne, and that Targaryens practiced polygamy, the Martell family might not have been too thrilled at Rhaegar treating Elia this way. As Oberyn states, it is a big insult to Elia's, and therefore the Martell family's honor. So not only would they have been angry at Lyanna's and Rhaegar's affair/marriage, wouldn't her presence in their land (or at their borders) not infuriate them even more?</p>

<p>I can think of a few explanations:</p>

<ol>
<li>Rhaegar's and Lyanna's affair was secret and the Martells did not know that Lyanna was in Dorne. </li>
<li>The Martells believed that Rhaegar was ""the Prince that was Promised"" (as he believed himself at some point) and that he needed to have three children (Aegon, Rhaenys and Visenya, named after Aegon the Conqueror and his sisters), while Elia had given birth to two children before being rendered too weak, or possibly infertile, to have a third. In this case the Martells might have agreed with the alleged kidnapping/elopement. But in place of a little Visenya, Lyanna of course gave birth to Jon Targaryen-Snow.</li>
<li>This might have been a truly stupid decision on Rhaegar's part and GRRM will explain this later in the story.</li>
</ol>

<p>Which of these is plausible (in-universe), or might there be a better explanation? What did I miss?</p>

<p>In case the TV series and the book series contradict each other, explanations from the book series are preferred!</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","145088","<h3>Canon Answer</h3>
<p>The canon answer is: <em>We do not know yet</em>. There is not much data available about what went on in Tower of Joy and Rhaegar's mind. All the people who might have known what happened there are dead except Howland Reed. And even Howland Reed can't be expected to know what was actually Rhaegar thinking. Only man who might have known it was Arthur Dayne, Rhaegar's friend. Arthur was killed at tower of joy along with other white swords posted there.</p>
<p>It is most plausibly going to be explained in the upcoming installments.</p>
<h3>Speculation</h3>
<p>There is no reason to assume that Prince Doran had any way of knowing that Rhaegar was in Dorne.</p>
<p>Even if he knew about it, It is not place of Prince Doran to tell Rhaegar what to do and what not to do. Rhaegar is a prince of the blood and heir to the throne of Aegon the conqueror. Example is Prince Aegon (Later King Aegon V). Lords positively hated him but none dared to tell the Prince to leave their lands. However the counter example here is that Lady Jeyne Arryn of Vale expelled Prince Daemon Targaryen from Vale and forbid his entry into her domains ever again. However the difference here is, Daemon was younger brother of the King with no chance of inheriting the throne and no lands of his own so it was easier to offend him. Rhaegar was however the crown prince and Prince of Dragonstone, a power in his own right.</p>
<p>Also, the War did not start immediately after the kidnapping. There was this whole period where Brandon went to KL, King summoned Lord Rickard, Lord Rickard came to KL from Winterfell, Both were executed. King then sent orders to Lord Arryn to kill his wards. That started the war. So there must have been months in the prelude in which it wasnt clear if there was going to be a war so why should the cautious Prince Doran take the risk of offending the crown prince?</p>
<p>Prince Doran was however not pleased with the news he had received about the Stark girl and Rhaegar. When Aerys called his banners against the Rebels, Prince Doran was deliberately slow in response. He did not, if he knew Rhaegar was in Dorne, give command of Dornish Armies to the Prince. He only sent the Dornish Armies forward once the Crown Prince had left Dorne. There was this whole embassy under the Prince's uncle and King's guard Lewyn Martell too so it is plausible that it was Prince Lewyn who persuaded Doran to send his Armies forward.</p>
<p>In any case:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is no indication that Prince Doran knew about the prophecy of The Prince that was promised.</li>
<li>There is no indication that Prince Doran was aware of Rhaegar's presence in the Red Mountains. Even the King didn't know about his son's whereabouts.</li>
<li>Prince Doran obviously felt insult by events of Tourney of Harrenhal which resulted in passive-aggressive act of defiance e.g. not giving Rhaegar the command of his armies and being slow in his reaction when commanded by the King to send forth the Armies of Dorne.</li>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Night King is defeated and the White Walkers and their wights are dead along with anyone (presumably) who was behind the Wall prior to season 8,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>are the Night's Watch still required?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","211460","<p>Well no, but actually yes.</p>

<p>After Battle of the Dawn when the Others were defeated the first time, the Order retained its structure. They won but they didn't know if the threat was truly gone so they remained on their posts, defending the realms of Men against Night's King (The real one, not Darth Maul on Ice) and Wildlings. With time, they lost sense of their true purpose and many believed they were just meant to fight the Wildlings. </p>

<p>Now in the showverse, it seems <em>the Long Night</em> is over after stretching shockingly for almost one whole night. But that doesn't mean that the Watch has lost its usefulness. Here's why:</p>

<ol>
<li>Night's Watch provides a chance for redemption to criminals. For example <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Brynden_Rivers"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Brynden Rivers</a>, <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ulmer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ulmer of Kingswood</a>, <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Olyver_Bracken"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Olyver Bracken</a> etc. At th every least, it keeps dangerous criminals out of the society.</li>
<li>It provides a home to misfits like younger sons, bastards, orphans and starving who belong nowhere. For example <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Waymar_Royce"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Waymar Royce</a>, <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jon_Snow"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Jon Snow</a>, <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lommy_Greenhands"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lommy Greenhands</a>, <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Hot_Pie"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hotpie</a> etc.</li>
<li>It provides a way for the nobles to get rid of rival claimants in a way softer than execution and more permanent than exile. For example <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Yorick_V_Yronwood"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Yorick V Yronwood</a>, <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Eddard_Stark"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Eddard Stark</a> etc.</li>
<li>The hope of being allowed to take the black leads to swifter surrender of people with a losing cause. For example both <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon_II"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Aegon II</a> and <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Theon_Greyjoy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Theon Greyjoy</a> became very hopeful when their Maesters counselled them to join the Watch as their enemies approached. It's another story that both of them decided not to given that they didn't trust their enemies (Or in Theon's case, brothers on the Wall).</li>
<li>It provides a chance to the lowborn and bastards to rise high in the world. For example <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Cotter_Pyke"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cotter Pyke</a>, <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Satin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Satin</a> and <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jon_Snow"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Jon Snow</a>.</li>
<li>On the off-chance that the others might rise again, the Watch needs to be there to fight it again, wake the sleepers and defend the realms of men.</li>

"211457","What happens to the property of Westerosi Houses if they're wiped out?","<p>In <em>Game of Thrones</em>, we have now seen some of the Great Houses of the North and the Seven Kingdoms virtually wiped out. Is there a canon (TV show or books) answer to what happens to their lands etc? What would happen traditionally?</p>

<p>For example, would Houses</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Umber and Mormont</p>
</blockquote>

<p>come under Stark rule? What would become of House Tarly if Sam is still in the Night's Watch?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","211483","<p>We have seen that reassigning the lands of an extinct houses falls to both:</p>

<ol>
<li>The respective Lord Paramount. </li>
<li>The Crown</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, see House Hornwood. Lord Halys and his heir were slain fighting the Lannisters which meant an end of legitimate male line of that family. It fell to Winterfell to decide who will be the next Lord Hornwood. Candidates were nephew of Lord Hornwood by his sister (Whose father offered that he'll take Hornwood name if chosen the heir) Beren Tallhart and Larence Snow, Lord Hornwood's bastard. But of course it must be noted that Robb had declared himself King in the North at that point. So you could say ""the Crown"" decided the fate of the Hornwood lands. But did that duty fall to Robb simply because of his declaration? Or was it always his duty? We do not know.</p>

<p>We have plenty of examples where the Crown decided who gets the lands of extinct Houses. For example, take Harrenhal. The Crown periodically assigned it to new houses on extinction of the previous holders e.g. Harroways, Towers, Strongs, Lothstons etc. </p>

<p>Since the overwhelming pattern says the crown decides, Let's just assume that is true and the authority of the Lords Paramount doesn't extend to settling cases of extinct houses. Do bear in mind however, the case of Reynes. Lord Tywin wiped out that house when it rose in rebellion. King Aerys did not intervene. Later, King Robert and his hands did not seek to reassign the lands either. It was later when Tywin himself was hand to King Tommen that Castle Castamere was granted to House Spicer for their role in fall of the Young Wolf.</p>

<p>Now specifically for House Tarly, Lord Randyll Tarly's male line might be extinct (Given Dickon's death and Sam's vows) but he still had a number of daughters (Even if we dismiss the possibility of Randyll's brothers, uncles, cousins etc). Either one of them can inherit the Castle Hornhill in absence of a male claimant. If either one of them has a son, that boy can take the name of his grandfather and become the next Lord Tarly. Similarly, any man who marries any of the Tarly girls can take the name Tarly as well. <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/134306/54887"">See this answer for details</a></p>

<p>Has there been any indication that Game of Thrones will have the same ending that George R.R. Martin planned for his books? Or could the books have a completely different ending that the show (like the Night King winning)?</p>

<p>I believe that Martin (like many writers) had the idea for the overall story and the (possibly/hopefully crazy twist) awesome ending since he originally conceived it. So even though he's behind the show in writing, he still had an ending planned that everything has been building up to. Is the TV show going to use the same ending that Martin had planned all along or have they created their own ending to the story?</p>

<p>Obviously we won't know for sure until the books are finished (i.e. <s>never</s> someday) but I was hoping that either HBO or Martin has commented about this. </p>

<p>It just depends on whether or not it was the Night King's magic that was the cause of the irregular seasons to begin with.</p>
<p><strong>There were possibly regular seasons in ancient history, even further back than the Age of Heroes</strong>.</p>
<p>Writing and records were rare even back then and most of what we know from that time is legends passed on by story. The Maesters have looked into the matter but have not been able to conclude anything as there is just not enough information from that long ago...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though the Citadel has long sought to learn the manner by which it may predict the length and change of seasons, all efforts have been confounded. Septon Barth appeared to argue, in a fragmentary treatise, that <strong>the inconstancy of the seasons was a matter of magical art</strong> rather than trustworthy knowledge. Maester Nicol's The Measure of the Days—otherwise a laudable work containing much of use—seems influenced by this argument. Based upon his work on the movement of stars in the firmament, <strong>Nicol argues unconvincingly that the seasons might once have been of a regular length</strong>, determined solely by the way in which the globe faces the sun in its heavenly course. The notion behind it seems true enough—that the lengthening and shortening of days, if more regular, would have led to more regular seasons—but he could find <strong>no evidence that such was ever the case, beyond the most ancient of tales.</strong></p>

<p>As to why Missendei chose those words, it would only seem that she threw defiance in Cersei's teeth. &quot;Dragonfire&quot; might be her last words, but they are very likely to be prophetic since Dragonfire would probably be the last thing Cersei ever sees after what She's done.

</blockquote>

<p>Doesn't that indirectly mean that outside of having the best claim for Storm's End, he also has right now the best claim for the Iron Throne since he is now the legitimate heir of Robert who was the last king, and could create a lot more problems than solve, so in the future he could push his claim which technically should be stronger?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","211817","<h2>He is the third in the line of succession</h2>

<p>In the point of view of Daenerys, Robert Baratheon usurped the throne. The last legitime king was Aerys II, and his descendants are the legitimate successors.</p>

<p>Only two descendants seem to be alive: </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Jon Snow/Aegon, son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark, and Daenerys, daughter of Aerys II and Rhaella.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The succession follows male primogeniture law. This means the first son is the heir, then his brothers, and then sisters. If the prince had children, they have a better claim than his siblings.</p>

<p>By these laws, </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Jon/Aegon has a better claim than Daenerys, but Daenerys is still the rightful ruler while Jon is still Jon Snow and not Aegon Targaryen.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>What about Gendry's claim?</h3>

<p>Rhaelle Targaryen, the grandmother of Robert Baratheon, was the sister of Jaehaerys II. If he or all the descendants of Jaehaerys II die, Rhaelle Targaryen or her descendants become the heir to the crown.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Gendry, being the legitimate son of Robert Baratheon, is also the legitimate great-grandson of Rhaelle Targaryen, and therefore the third in succession line.</p>

<h3>What does that imply?</h3>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> As long as Jon is still officially Jon Snow and not Aegon Targaryen, Daenerys is the one with the better claim, and until she gets a child, Gendry is her heir.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Sam is shown with Gilly who is now pregnant with his child.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From my understanding he is still part of the Night's Watch and cannot father any children, this being a really big treason to the oath he took when he joined the Night's watch, especially since from my understanding it can happen to ""sleep around"", but this feels like a way bigger thing, especially since Jon congratulates him even though he is Warden of the North and thus directly responsible with deserters/oath breakers as shown in the first episode of the series, so shouldn't he be punished at this point or thrown out of the Night's Watch since I would guess they still exist in some form even after the long night.</p>

<p>Edit: I looked over that thread but it doesn't answer my question, since I say that he still is part of the Nights Watch, and my question relates to the punishment/ if he should be punished for the actions he took, or why people don't seem to care even though he is part of the Nights Watch.</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","211841","<p>First off, its not treason to break an oath, that's oath-breaking. Treason is acting against your country - or in the context of Westeros, the King/Queen. Though admittedly, oath-breaking is a fairly serious offense, especially to the Night's Watch. However, as Lord Commander Jeor Mormont said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If we beheaded every boy who rode to Mole's Town in the night, only ghosts would guard the Wall.<br>
  <sub><em>A Game of Thrones - Chapter 70: Jon IX.</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So clearly minor offenses are overlooked by the Night's Watch simply because it would be impractical to do otherwise.</p>

<p>Coming to the situation with Sam and Gilly. Assuming that the Night's Watch as an institution even exists anymore, and assuming that anyone of authority exists to mete out punishment, literally no one is going to care about something so trivial as them having a kid. There is a time and a place, and this time and place never existed in the context of the show, let alone following the Battle of Winterfell.</p>

It has more credence than the other two theories and I am also partial. Assuming it is true, how to explain these two facts?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Jon Snow's hand is badly burned when he fights the wight to save commander Mormont.
Dany is near invincible to fire. And she says of Viserys ""He was no dragon"" when he dies of the burning golden crown. Assuming that fire immunity passes from parents, how to explain the fact that Jon gets burned? (Come to think of it, The burned hand is reminded persistently after that)</p></li>
<li><p>Jon Snow is a warg.
It is never mentioned that Ned Stark is a warg. But seems like all his (real?) children are. Is it a coincidence that Jon is a warg? Can this ability pass from mother's side to a child? </p></li>
</ol>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><jon-snow>","72014","<p>The first contradiction is actually based on a misconception. <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/9356/is-daenerys-targaryen-immune-to-fire"">Targeryons are not immune to fire</a>, as showcased by Viserys and the Tragedy at Summerhall.</p>

<p>The second one is trickier, as the genetics of warging is never entirely explained. There are zero examples of a warg passing their abilities on to their child. But if R + L = J, the Starks and Jon are still cousins, making it well within the realm of possibility they'd inherit similar traits. After all, if Ned could recessively pass the trait down to at least three kids married to a Riverlander, why couldn't Lyanna with a Targaryen?</p>

<p>One thing that DOES seem to be common to all wargs is that they hold to the old gods and are raised in the North. So for all we know, someone with no bloodline from the North could end up with warging abilities based on some unknown Northern magic.</p>

<p>Now in universe they were certainly still fighting inside the castle somewhere. We are shown small point of views from the main characters and don't see the majority of the battle and what goes on. It makes sense that we miss a lot of what actually happens. They survived because their battle happened off screen and away from what we were supposed to see, for all we know around the next wall there was still a few thousand vs the wights.</p>
<p>The Unsullied are also &quot;locked out&quot; of Winterfell when Grey Worm pulls the bridge and so it is possible that some of them were still fighting around the castle grounds against wights in pocket groups here and there.</p>
<p>Out of universe this makes sense as well, the writers wanted to convey the message of all hope being lost and so wouldn't show a huge amount of the army left because that moves away from the message they are trying to send.</p>

"212081","Is Martin subtly insulting the showrunners of Game of Thrones in Fire and Blood?","<p>One of the best moments in the book, hands down, is when Martin throws shade at Game of Thrones and the show runners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. Under the guise of the discussion of a book called ""A Caution for Young Girls"", Martin makes his opinion of certain decisions made in the adaptation process of his own books very clear. He begins by calling the book “distasteful,” a book found in brothels and catering to those of low morals. He then mentions that parts of the book “strain credulity” given how ridiculous the tales are, and increasingly so as the story continues.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We have no way to ascertain the veracity of her story, nor even whether she was in truth the author of this infamous book (some argue plausibly that the text is the product of several hands, for the style of the prose varies greatly from episode to episode).”<br>
  (<em>Fire and Blood</em>, p. 157)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean…good lord. The use of “episode to episode” makes the true object of his ridicule pretty clear. But he doesn’t stop there. Continuing with his mockery of the writers of the tales, he writes,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“[T]he scribes responsible were most likely septons expelled from the Faith for drunkenness, theft, or fornication, failed students who left the Citadel without a chain, hired quills from the Free Cities, or mummers (the worst of all). Lacking the rigor of maesters, such scribes oft feel free to “improve” on the texts they are copying. (Mummers in particular are prone to this.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the case of ""A Caution for Young Girls"", such “improvements” largely consisted of adding ever more episodes of depravity and changing the existing episodes to make them even more disturbing and lascivious. As alteration followed alteration over the years, it became ever more difficult to ascertain which was the original text, to the extent that even maesters at the Citadel cannot agree as to the title of the book, as has been noted.” (<em>Fire and Blood</em>, p.158-9)</p>

"212339","Under what charges was this character executed in Game of Thrones, The Bells?","<p>In the last episode of <em>Game of Thrones</em> (season 8, episode 5)</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Daenerys executed her master spy, Lord Varys, for treason by burning him alive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do understand that he was favouring</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Jon Snow</p>
</blockquote>

<p>to be the king of the <em>Seven Kingdoms</em> because he thought that he would make a better ruler than Daenerys. Plus, he said several times during the show that</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> for him it doesn't matter <em>who</em> sits on the <em>Iron Throne</em>, because he fights for the people, so he will favour whoever he sees will be the best ruler <em>for the people</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, other than the obvious fact that was prompting</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Jon Snow</p>
</blockquote>

<p>to take the crown (in a private conversation, which never arrived to Daenerys because she had shut herself in the castle), I saw no actual treason that would justify his sentence.</p>

<p>From what I understood he just “knew the truth about the heir to the <em>Iron Throne</em>” the same as Tyrion did (and basically half the main characters of the show thanks to Sansa).</p>

<p>So was there a formal accusation held against him for his sentence, or was he executed just because Daenerys wanted to do so?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","212340","<p>He was executed for treason, the main reason appears to be because he was conspiring outside of Dany's orders to inform everyone who Jon Snow is and that he has a better claim to the Iron Throne and so should sit on it instead of her.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tyrion:</strong> Your Grace? There's something you need to know.</p>
<p><strong>Daenerys:</strong> Someone has betrayed me.</p>
<p><strong>Tyrion:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Daenerys:</strong> Jon Snow.</p>
<p><strong>Tyrion:</strong> Varys.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p><strong>Tyrion:</strong> If I have failed you, my queen, forgive me. Our intentions were good. We wanted what you want. A better world, all of us. Varys as much as anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Daenerys:</strong> But it doesn't matter now.</p>
<p><strong>Tyrion:</strong> No. It doesn't matter now.</p>
<p><sub><em>Game of Thrones</em>, Season 8 Episode 5, &quot;The Bells&quot;</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note though that Tyrion is aware that Varys would also try to assassinate Dany following their conversation in the previous episode so could have told her that off screen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Varys:</strong> You know where my loyalty stands. You know I will never betray the realm.</p>
<p><strong>Tyrion:</strong> What is the realm? A vast continent, home to millions of people, most of whom don't care who sits on the Iron Throne.</p>
<p><strong>Varys:</strong> Millions of people, many of whom will die if the wrong person sits on that throne. We don't know their names, but they're just as real as you and I. They deserve to live. They deserve food for their children. I will act in their interest, no matter the personal cost.</p>
<p><strong>Tyrion:</strong> So, what happens to her? Please. Don't.</p>
<p><strong>Varys:</strong> I've spoken as honestly as I can. Each of us has a choice to make. I pray we choose wisely.</p>
<p><sub><em>Game of Thrones</em>, Season 8 Episode 4, &quot;The Last of the Starks&quot;</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In &quot;The Bells&quot; it also appears that Varys is trying to poison her through the use of Martha bringing her food. However, Dany seems to be somewhat wise to an attempt to kill her and has locked herself away and isn't eating.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Varys:</strong> And? Nothing?</p>
<p><strong>Martha:</strong> She won't eat.</p>
<p><strong>Varys:</strong> We'll try again at supper.</p>
<p><strong>Martha:</strong> I think they're watching me.</p>
<p><strong>Varys:</strong> Who?</p>
<p><strong>Martha:</strong> Her soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>Varys:</strong> Of course they are. That's their job. What have I told you, Martha?</p>
<p><strong>Martha:</strong> The greater the risk, the greater the reward.</p>
<p><strong>Varys:</strong> Go on. They'll be missing you in the kitchen.</p>
<p><sub><em>Game of Thrones</em>, Season 8 Episode 5, &quot;The Bells&quot;</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s also worth noting as mentioned in a comment that Dany made Varys promise to tell her to her face instead of going behind her back if he ever thought she was in the wrong. Whilst he has done that initially she ignored his advice and so now he’s going behind her back against her wishes so that probably plays a part in it too.</p>
"
"144719","How do Rorge and Biter end up with the Brave Companions?","<p>I don't see how Rorge and Biter were recruited in Brave Companions company.</p>

<p>At first, they were with Yoren's crew, heading to the Wall. They were attacked by Amory Lorch and escaped from their cage with an axe Arya gave them.</p>

<p>Were they captured by Amory Lorch or did they hide from the attackers ? Amory Lorch looked decided too kill evreybody of Yoren's crew.</p>

<p>Later, we see them with the Brave Companions. I don't think Amory would have sell them or given them to Vargo Hoat because Amory and Vargo disliked each other.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","144720","<p>They joined Amory Lorch after Arya saved them from the fire however it is not clear how they joined the Manticore's men. We only see them from Arya's POV and Arya did not see them since the time she saved them from fire surrounding their cage till she saw them again in Harrenhal, wearing Lannister uniforms. </p>

<p>From Arya's POV in ACOK:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then she saw the three near the end of the column.</p>
  
  <p>Rorge had donned a black halfhelm with a broad iron nasal that made it
  hard to see that he did not have a nose. Biter rode ponderously beside
  him on a destrier that looked ready to collapse under his weight.
  Halfhealed burns covered his body, making him even more hideous than
  before.</p>
  
  <p>But Jaqen H’ghar still smiled. His garb was still ragged and filthy,
  but he had found time to wash and brush his hair. It streamed down
  across his shoulders, red and white and shiny, and Arya heard the
  girls giggling to each other in admiration.</p>
  
  <p>I should have let the fire have them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later, Brave Companions brought some northern captives to Harrenhal. Arya forced Jaqen to help her free them. Jaqen brought them along. </p>

<p><em>The Weasel Soup</em> incident is:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> The Brave companions switched sides and joined the Starks. That
 resulted in occupation of Harrenhal by Roose Bolton and death of Amory
 Lorch, Lannister appointed commander of Harrenhal. Arya, Jaqen, Rorge and biter helped by freeing the Northmen, unaware that this was the plan of Brave companions all along. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So They helped Jaqen and Arya in the Weasel Soup incident:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Then she heard the ugly sound of Rorge’s voice. “Cook,” he shouted.
  “We’ll take your bloody broth.” Arya let go of the spoon in dismay. I
  never told him to bring them. Rorge wore his iron helmet, with the
  nasal that half hid his missing nose. Jaqen and Biter followed him
  into the kitchen.</p>
  
  <p>“The bloody broth isn’t bloody ready yet,” the cook said. “It needs to
  simmer. We only now put in the onions and-”</p>
  
  <p>“Shut your hole, or I’ll shove a spit up your ass and we’ll baste you
  for a turn or two. I said broth and I said now.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later, They apparently joined the Brave companions after the <em>Weasel Soup incident</em>. They told so to Ser Robbet Glover after the incident:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""This of the soup, that was clever,” the man Glover was saying. “I did
  not expect that. Was it Lord Hoat’s idea?”</p>
  
  <p>Rorge began to laugh. He laughed so hard that snot flew out the hole
  where his nose had been. Biter sat on top of one of the dead men,
  holding a limp hand as he gnawed at the fingers. Bones cracked between
  his teeth.</p>
  
  <p>“Who are you men?” A crease appeared between Robett Glover’s brows.
  “You were not with Hoat when he came to Lord Bolton’s encampment.
  <strong>Are you of the Brave Companions?</strong>”</p>
  
  <p><strong>Rorge wiped the snot off his chin with the back of his hand. “We are now.”</strong></p>
  
  <p>“This man has the honor to be Jaqen H’ghar, once of the Free City of
  Lorath. This man’s discourteous companions are named Rorge and Biter.
  A lord will know which is Biter.” He waved a hand toward Arya. “And
  here-”</p>
  
  <p>“I’m Weasel,” she blurted, before he could tell who she really was.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then Jaqen left for good and the two criminals appear to have been associated with the Qohorik mercenaries known as the Brave companions from that point onwards:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Until the eventual re-capture of Harrenhal by Gregor Clegane and
 desertion of the Brave companions in different bands, trying to find a
 passage across the narrow sea. The two criminals took to terrorizing
 the peasants in Riverlands.</p>

<p>Although from watching the scene it is worth noting that after his eyes are gouged he doesn't actually <em>need</em> to see. He uses his hands to feel Gregor to find where to stab and when he's free simply runs forward at Gregor rather than anything that requires vision.</p>

<p>Gregor also seemed to be trying to crush Sandor's skull, like with Oberyn, so the full force of the crushing would be applied around the skull rather than solely into the eye sockets.</p>

"212348","What was the ring Varys took off?","<p>When we see Varys writting letters for the second time in season 8 episode 5, he is picked up by Greyworm.</p>

<p>Varys hears them coming, half heartedly burns the letter and takes off some jewelry, where we get to see a thin ring in particular.</p>

<p>It quickly becomes apparent that Varys knows he will not live to see another sunrise and lives his last moments as planned and calm as if he had written the script himself. </p>

<p>I can see him burning the letter in order to not give up the recipient in the opening, but what about that ring? Why is it important enough for him to take it off? Why is it important enough to show us? Why does he prepare his last walk by taking off that ring? </p>
","<game-of-thrones>","212351","<p>There was nothing special about the ring. The action, however, served two purposes.</p>

<p>When he hears the footsteps, he knows whats happening. As you touched on in your answer, &quot;It quickly becomes apparent that Varys knows he will not live to see another sunrise and lives his last moments as planned and calm as if he had written the script himself.&quot; He has accepted his fate and so he prepares himself for death.</p>
<p><strong>Out of Universe</strong>, it serves to give the viewer a glimpse inside Varys head. For us to know that Varys understand whats about happen, he has to take action. Think of the knock on the door earlier in the episode, we were worried, but he did nothing but hide the letter and look up. Based on our relationship with Varys, we knew he was still under control of the situation. This time, we all hear the boots, and then Varys <em>burns</em> the letter and starts removing rings. We know he is about to die, and now we know that <em>he knows</em> he is about to die.</p>

<p>It also seems that she doesn't have any will to surrender.</p>

<p><strong>So who commanded that?</strong><br>
<strong>Or</strong> (if no one), <strong>who actually did it</strong> (maybe they decided by themselves to do it)?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","212366","<p>The first one to surrender (on screen) was the Lannister Captain that was facing down Jon, Grey Worm, a street full of Unsullied and Northmen, and a rather angry looking dragon on the tower.</p>

<p>Once someone with a position of authority set the precedent of surrender, the cry to ""ring the bells!"" spread through the army. We don't see who first uttered the cry, but we can safely assume it was the captain (or a lieutenant nearby) calling out to signal that the city surrendered. </p>

<p>Ringing the bells was apparently a culturally known sign, and since it was something a city's people would do, instead of something requiring the Lord/Lady/General to do (like a parley), it would seem it was somewhat common. This would make sense in a world where random towns would be used to various armies ""conquering"" them regularly. Like Tyrion said: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is the realm? A vast continent, home to millions of people, most of whom don't care who sits on the Iron Throne.<br>
  <sub><em>Game of Thrones - S08E04: Last of the Starks</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The random citizens would rather pay taxes to the next Lord over, than die in defense of their current one. So once the army started surrendering, they raised the cry to ""ring the bells!"" and signal the surrender so that no one else had to die from the massive dragon who was actively burning down their city.</p>

<p>In short, and to answer the question directly, it was a general consensus based on cultural norm and prompted by the Lannister Captain who realized he was going to lose his battle.</p>

","<game-of-thrones>","212389","<h1>It's just a Gregor thing</h1>

<p>I'll reiterate my point from <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/79701/21267"">earlier</a>, George R. R. Martin has written Gregor Clegane as a ""murderous brute"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He's a murderous brute, and really needs no reason to kill someone.<br /><sup><em>-<a href=""https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Tournament#Tourney_of_the_Hand"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>So Spake Martin</strong> http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Asshai.com_Interview_in_Barcelona</a>.</em></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Imagine how much more murderous and brutish he is once revived as an undead version of himself. GRRM has also said about those who survive death that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My characters who come back from death are worse for wear. In some ways, they're not even the same characters anymore. The body may be moving, but some aspect of the spirit is changed or transformed, and they've lost something. One of the characters who has come back repeatedly from death is Beric Dondarrion, The Lightning Lord. Each time he's revived he loses a little more of himself. He was sent on a mission before his first death. He was sent on a mission to do something, and it's like, that's what he's clinging to. He's forgetting other things, he's forgetting who he is, or where he lived. He's forgotten the woman who he was once supposed to marry. Bits of his humanity are lost every time he comes back from death; he remembers that mission. His flesh is falling away from him, but this one thing, this purpose that he had is part of what's animating him and bringing him back to death. I think you see echoes of that with some of the other characters who have come back from death.<br /><sup><em>-<a href=""http://www.maximumfun.org/sound-young-america/george-r-r-martin-author-song-ice-and-fire-series-interview-sound-young-america#transcript"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.maximumfun.org/sound-young-america/george-r-r-martin-author-song-ice-and-fire-series-interview-sound-young-america#transcript</a></em></sup></p>

<p>This is echoed multiple times with Gregor, given how dead he was and how focused he was on his rage against his brother, Sandor.</p>

<p>You'll recall that this isn't the first time that he's disobeyed orders and protocol to go after Sandor, in Season 1 of <em>Game of Thrones</em> (and the related first book, A Song of Ice and Fire: A Game of Thrones), he attacks and nearly kills no other than Sandor Clegane, during the <a href=""https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Tournament#Tourney_of_the_Hand"" rel=""noreferrer"">tourney of the Hand</a>.</p>

<p>There is also the case of Tysha whom Tyrion married in his younger days.

<p>Varys is almost certainly doing the same thing here. So what lords do we know of that don't know this information and probably would want to? Well the only two I can think of right now that have the most importance would be the new Prince of Dorne and Yara Greyjoy, there would of course be others but they're the only named ones. And we might add in the Reeds and wildlings there too but they seem to have left the conflict altogether now.</p>
<p>Gendry Baratheon was also missing from the battle and as a newly legitimised bastard who is made Lord of Storm's End he would most certainly be on Dany's side initially.

<p><strong>Why are the other dragons so easy to hit with projectiles, yet Drogon isn't?</strong></p>

<p>Is it plot armor, or is there another reason?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","212454","<p><strong>Drogon is the biggest</strong><br>
Drogon is essentially the big brother of the three. He's the largest, potentially the fastest and most probably the strongest; he's the alpha.</p>

<p><strong>Drogon has Dany in the pilot seat</strong><br>
It would make a lot of difference that Dany is the one riding Drogon, able to give commands, and steer him better than the other two may.</p>

<p><strong>Drogon has the most combat experience</strong><br>
Being Dany's main ride, Drogon has experienced a lot of attacks, he has gained the most experience under attack than his two siblings.</p>

<p><strong>Viserion was hunted by the Night King</strong><br>
Olympic level javelin throwing is an understatement for this guy. The Night King took down Viserion as they were retreating with an epic throw of his spear. He's powerful, that spear was travelling very fast, and hard. It pierced Viserion exactly where it needed to to mortally wound him.</p>

<p><strong>Rhaegal was injured already</strong><br>
In the scene where Rhaegal is shot down by Euron's scorpion, we can see that Drogon and Rhaegal are flying in a tight, low and slow formation. Rhaegal is visibly injured, his wings torn from the Battle of the Long Night. This makes him slower, and a much easier target.</p>

<p>Besides, Euron had the element of surprise; he could take his time with his shots and make it count. Notice how once alerted, Drogon was able to evade the rest of the arrows?</p>

<p><strong>Drogon <em>was</em> in fact hit once</strong><br>
Recall in the Seventh Season, <a href=""https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Drogon#Season_7"" rel=""noreferrer"">Drogon is hit by Bronn's scorpion</a>, severely damaging his shoulder. So he's not invincible.</p>

He's been shown to be a strong leader and a half decent battle commander, he's the sort you'd want as a second in command on the field to help organise the troops.

<p>There was a really strange situation in the hall of Winterfell before that: Daenerys asked if anyone knew who the current Lord was and nobody answered, as if nobody knew. Tyrion, Varys, Sam Tarly, Bran with all his super-powers... they were all there in the room and yet nobody answered.</p>

<p>Did really none of them know the answer? Was there another reason they all kept silent?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","212534","<p>Well that is because there was no Lord of Storm's End as far as they knew or we know. Nobles grow up learning about other noble families' family trees, particularly their neighbours and great Houses. </p>

<p>Had Daenerys asked that Question after Robert died, they'd have all answered Renly Baratheon. Had she asked that question after Renly died, their answer would have been Stannis Baratheon. Had she asked that after Stannis died (And Shireen had been alive), their answer would have been Shireen Baratheon (Or Lord Stannis' little girl for those who couldn't recall her name). </p>

<p>Nobody knows any other Baratheon, nor have they heard any news of a Stormlander resurgence after Stannis' demise. So as far as they can guess, Storm's End lacks a lord and so do the Stormlands as a whole. The silence was the answer. Why Bran refused to answer? Well only Bran can tell but if we had to venture a guess I'd say that is because Bran has repeatedly told people that he doesn't really feel or need anything, he's mostly apathetic to whatever is happening around him.

<p>Is there any evidence that he rose to such power because of such blackmailing?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","212555","<p>This answer is based mostly on the books, because:</p>

<ol>
<li>They provide more lore on the subject.</li>
<li>I haven't seen the show.</li>
</ol>

<p>People with the abilities of the Three-Eyed Raven (or Three-Eyed Crow as he is referred to in the books) are properly referred to as <strong><a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Greenseer"" rel=""noreferrer"">Greenseers</a>.</strong> There is no evidence such a being has ever sat the Iron Throne, and there is a great deal of lore suggesting that none ever has.</p>

<p>The Greensight ability originated with the <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Children_of_the_forest"" rel=""noreferrer"">Children of the Forest</a>. They were driven north of the Wall by either the First men or the Andals long before the Targaryens conquered Westeros and established the Iron Throne. The ability persists among the people of the North and the Neck, such as Bran Stark and (in the books) Jojen Reed, because these peoples have ancient Westerosi ancestry going back to the First Men. I believe that their Greensight is evidence suggesting that their ancestors also interbred with the Children of the Forest.</p>

<p>The only other character known to be a Greenseer is <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Brynden_Rivers"" rel=""noreferrer"">Brynden Rivers</a>, previously known as Lord Bloodraven. This is the character known in the show as <em>the</em> Three-Eyed Raven. He was Hand of the King and master of spies a hundred years before the show begins, but never a King in his own right. He had a reputation as a sorcerer, and it was widely believed that he had magical abilities to see what was happening throughout the Kingdom. I don't know if it's ever confirmed that he used Greensight during this time or whether that ability only manifested after he went north of the Wall and met the Children of the Forest. While he is not from the North, being the bastard child of King Aegon IV Targaryen and <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Melissa_Blackwood"" rel=""noreferrer"">Melissa Blackwood</a>, he <em>does</em> carry the blood of the First Men, since his mother's family was driven from the North by the Starks thousands of years ago. </p>

<p>While he was never a King, he is certainly an example of a powerful character whose greatest weapon was information (although his bow was nothing to scoff at either). He rose to power after slaying his half-brother, Daemon Blackfyre, during the <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/First_Blackfyre_Rebellion"" rel=""noreferrer"">First Blackfyre Rebellion</a>. It is unclear to what extent, if any, his uncanny abilities were key to this victory.</p>

<p>The only houses to sit the Iron Throne are Targaryen, Baratheon (briefly), and Lannister (currently). There is no evidence of any of these lineages having Greensight, as none of them are descended from the Children of the Forest. </p>

<p>And When he learnt that Joffrey died, Jaime was concerned only about how Cersei would be feeling and he did not feel distressed himself at all.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The king is dead, they told him, never knowing that Joffrey was his
  son as well as his sovereign.</p>
  
  <p>""The Imp opened his throat with a dagger,"" a costermonger declared at
  the roadside inn where they spent the night. ""He drank his blood from
  a big gold chalice."" The man did not recognize the bearded one-handed
  knight with the big bat on his shield, no more than any of them, so he
  said things he might otherwise have swallowed, had he known who was
  listening.</p>
  
  <p>""The dwarf's wife did the murder with him,"" swore an archer in Lord
  Rowan's livery. ""Afterward, she vanished from the hall in a puff of
  brimstone, and a ghostly direwolf was seen prowling the Red Keep,
  blood dripping from his jaws."" Jaime sat silent through it all,
  letting the words wash over him, a horn of ale forgotten in his one
  good hand. Joffrey. My blood. My firstborn. My son. He tried to bring
  the boy's face to mind, but his features kept turning into Cersei's.
  She will be in mourning, her hair in disarray and her eyes red from
  crying, her mouth trembling as she tries to speak. She will cry again
  when she sees me, though she'll fight the tears. His sister seldom
  wept but when she was with him. She could not stand for others to
  think her weak. Only to her twin did she show her wounds. She will
  look to me for comfort and revenge. <br><sub>A Storm of Swords - Jaime VII</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then we see that Jaime realises that he simply felt nothing for the child who might have been his seed but was not his son. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>He was curiously calm. Men were supposed to go mad with grief when
  their children died, he knew</strong>. They were supposed to tear their hair
  out by the roots, to curse the gods and swear red vengeance. <strong>So why
  was it that he felt so little?</strong> The boy lived and died believing Robert
  Baratheon his sire. [.....]</p>
  
  <p>And now he’s dead. <strong>He pictured Joff lying still and cold with a face
  black from poison, and still felt nothing. Perhaps he was the monster
  they claimed. If the Father Above came down to offer him back his son
  or his hand, Jaime knew which he would choose</strong>. He had a second son,
  after all, and seed enough for many more. <strong>If Cersei wants another
  child I’ll give her one... and this time I’ll hold him</strong>, and the Others
  take those who do not like it. Robert was rotting in his grave, and
  Jaime was sick of lies. <br><sub>A Storm of Swords - Jaime VII</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He did not rape Cersei beside Joffrey's bier in the books, He took the initiative but Cersei wanted it as well. There he notes, irritated, to himself how his sister keeps referring to their son as ""My Son"". </p>

<p>And later he clearly states how he feels about his children. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You were Robert’s queen. And yet you won’t be mine.”</p>
  
  <p>“I would, if I dared. But our son—”</p>
  
  <p>“Tommen is no son of mine, no more than Joffrey was.” His voice was
  hard. “You made them Robert’s too.” <br><sub>A Feast for Crows - Jaime I</sub> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in conclusion:</p>

<ol>
<li>Jaime does not seem like the traditional fatherly sort, although that might have been because of his sister's lies and secrets that made Jaime sick. Nevertheless He was only too glad to stop developing any affection for Joff. He did however feel affection for Tommen and Myrcella.</li>
<li>Jaime resented the fact that his sister made the children Robert's and hers. While he's irritated whenever she says something along those lines, he certainly doesn't make any effort to remedy that himself. </li>
<li>Jaime didn't feel any sorrow at Joffrey's death, he'd practiced apathy towards the boy for far too long. The fact that he'd rather choose a hand than Joffrey's life if he were given a choice says it all.</li>

<p>A lot of the ""evidence"" is around Varys' new ""little bird"", the girl who says:</p>

<p>To which Varys replies:</p>

  <p> ""We'll try again at supper"" and ""The greater the risk, the greater the reward"".</p>

<p>Is this true? <strong>Is there official confirmation that Varys was attempting to poison this character?</strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones>","212578","<p>As far as I know there is no official word on this but I don't think we need official confirmation to come to the conclusion that yes he was trying to poison her.</p>
<p>In the Inside the Episode D.B. Weiss says the following which hints at a poisoning attempt, how else would he &quot;overthrow&quot; her without an army? Of course it could be argued he's talking about Varys having secret conversations with Jon and sending the letters but there's more to it than that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>D.B. Weiss:</strong> I think Varys knew that it was unlikely that he would survive the attempt to overthrow Dany in favour of Jon. And he also knew that ethically in his mind he had no choice but to try to do that anyway.</p>
<p><sub><em>Game of Thrones</em>, Season 8 Episode 5, &quot;The Bells&quot; - Inside the Episode</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Episode 4, Tyrion's reaction to seeing Varys' face after asking what will happen to her is enough evidence on its own, in that moment both characters know Varys will attempt to kill her. And it's shown enough that we the viewers should have picked up on it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Varys:</strong> You know where my loyalty stands. You know I will never betray the realm.</p>
<p><strong>Tyrion:</strong> What is the realm? A vast continent, home to millions of people, most of whom don't care who sits on the Iron Throne.</p>
<p><strong>Varys:</strong> Millions of people, many of whom will die if the wrong person sits on that throne. We don't know their names, but they're just as real as you and I. They deserve to live. They deserve food for their children. I will act in their interest, no matter the personal cost.</p>
<p><strong>Tyrion:</strong> So, what happens to her? <strong>Please. Don't.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Varys:</strong> I've spoken as honestly as I can. Each of us has a choice to make. I pray we choose wisely.</p>
<p><sub><em>Game of Thrones</em>, Season 8 Episode 4, &quot;The Last of the Starks&quot;</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then lets look at the Martha conversation again, they're &quot;trying again&quot; at supper which isn't necessarily odd in itself but then Martha is worried that the soldiers are watching her. Why would she be worried if all they are doing is bringing her food? Varys says it's their job and again he probably would word that differently if it wasn't for the poisoning attempt.</p>
<p>Lastly, examine <em>&quot;The greater the risk, the greater the reward.&quot;</em> Why would there be a risk involved in simply bringing her food if there wasn't more to it? It isn't just implied it is strongly implied that Varys is trying to poison her through the use of Martha. In fact it's all but spelled out for us.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Varys:</strong> And? Nothing?</p>
<p><strong>Martha:</strong> She won't eat.</p>
<p><strong>Varys:</strong> We'll try again at supper.</p>
<p><strong>Martha:</strong> I think they're watching me.</p>
<p><strong>Varys:</strong> Who?</p>
<p><strong>Martha:</strong> Her soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>Varys:</strong> Of course they are. That's their job. What have I told you, Martha?</p>

"212587","Would Gendry have inherited Storm's End?","<p><em>This is a question about the show. In the books, some characters are alive that are dead in the show, so the answer would be different.</em></p>

<p>In S08E04, Queen Daenerys makes a show of granting Storm's End to Gendry, the bastard of King Robert Baratheon. Before she does, she asks if anyone knows who the current Lord of Storm's End is. Nobody knows, and she gives it to Gendry.</p>

<p><strong>Did Queen Daenerys give Gendry something he wouldn't have had otherwise? Or did she just make a big show of pointing out that he was the rightful heir?</strong> </p>

<p>Obviously a real Baratheon would inherit before Gendry. Was there an obscure Baratheon that nobody knew about? One that Queen Daenerys supplanted when she made Gendry the Lord of Storm's End?</p>

<p>Do bastards ever inherit property? When no true-born heirs are alive? If so, then as the oldest (possibly the last) bastard child of King Robert, wouldn't Gendry be the rightful heir?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","212589","<p>Of all the known members of House Baratheon in the show they are all dead. So that leaves us with whether or not Bastards have rights, well that isn't a clear cut case as GRRM has said before.</p>

<p>What if there are no childen, only grandchildren and great grandchildren. Is precedence or proximity the more important principle? Do bastards have any rights? What about bastards who have been legitimized, do they go in at the end after the trueborn kids, or according to birth order? What about widows? And what about the will of the deceased? Can a lord disinherit one son, and name a younger son as heir? Or even a bastard?</p>
<p>There are no clear cut answers, either in Westeros or in real medieval history. Things were often decided on a case by case basis. A case might set a precedent for later cases... but as often as not, the precedents conflicted as much as the claims.</p>

<p>However, Gendry is also an unacknowledged bastard of Robert's so wouldn't really have been in the line of succession and thinks so himself. And in the show bastards appear to have less rights of succession compared to the books, see Ramsay Snow for example.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Daenerys:</strong> Gendry. That's right, isn't it?</p>
<p><strong>Gendry:</strong> Yes, Your Grace.</p>
<p><strong>Daenerys:</strong> You're Robert Baratheon's son. You are aware he took my family's throne and tried to have me murdered?</p>

<p><strong>Daenerys:</strong> Yes, he's dead. His brothers are too. So who's Lord of Storm's End now?</p>
<p><strong>Gendry:</strong> I don't know, Your Grace.</p>
<p><strong>Daenerys:</strong> Does anyone? I think you should be Lord of Storm's End.</p>
<p><strong>Gendry:</strong> I can't be. I'm a bastard.</p>

<p><strong>The episode was very divisive among fans, what was your reaction and the cast’s reaction to the twists, especially Daenerys’ decision to ignore the bells? And what did you think of the fans reaction?</strong></p>
<p>First of all, the diversity of the fans and the passion they bring to the table is admirable, and you want to have all of it. You want to have the ones that go, “This is the greatest show ever made,” and you wanna have the people that go, “I hate this show. I’ve always hated it. I want the books now.” You cannot satisfy one billion people, it’s not possible. But you want to have them commit to the show, even if they don’t like it. There was a guy called P.T. Barnum who said “There’s no such thing as bad press, there’s only press.” And I welcome everyone, people I agree with or people I disagree with. And I have on social media been discussing “Game of Thrones” with fans and I will continue to do that, because you owe the fans information and they need a place where they can ask questions about what they like or dislike and it’s totally cool, it’s passionate. And you’ve gotta love that. Besides that, for me, the twists and turns was logical, because this is “Game of Thrones,” and people have to die. And I would be very, very surprised if we end up with a happy ending next week. I know how it’s gonna end, so I’m not gonna say a word. But Dan and David have delivered for seven seasons admirable content and I would say they have delivered extremely well again this season. But again, you can’t please everyone.</p>

"212638","Can a foot soldier kill a dragon? If yes, are there any examples from the past on how did they do it?","<p>As the question says, can a foot soldier kill a dragon? For example, let's suppose Jon turns against Daenerys and comes face to face with Drogon. Can he kill the dragon with the tools he has at hand? For clarification, the tools aren't necessarily limited to one on one combat. For the intent of the question, all existing technology and soldiers at his command shall be considered tools.</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","212650","<p>It <em>could</em>, strong could, be possible for Jon to kill Drogon under current means. Firstly, there might be prototype scorpions or some of the first versions that Bronn used laying around somewhere in the Red Keep he could use and attack him when he's not expecting it.</p>
<p>However, it is also possible to kill a dragon with just hand weapons as we saw at the Storming of the Dragonpit. Granted these dragons were smaller, younger and not as strong as Drogon as they had been chained up under the Dragonpit for some time but it isn't too much of a stretch to apply what we know of it from there to Drogon.</p>
<p>At the Storming of the Dragonpit five dragons died, most be some means of hack and slash with hand weapons rather than anything more sophisticated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pycelle:</strong> For over a hundred years, the Targaryen dragons cemented their breeders' hold on the Seven Kingdoms, if not each other. When Targaryen fought Targaryen in the civil war called the Dance of the Dragons, an angry mob stormed the Dragonpit, that huge, now-ruined vault where Targaryens stabled their beasts. Thousands died, but through sheer numbers and madness, five of the Targaryen dragons lay dead by the morning. Which was perhaps too many. Thereafter, each generation of dragons grew smaller than its parents'. Their skulls used to line the throne room of the Red Keep in order of birth. The oldest, Balerion, could swallow an ox whole. The last skull was barely the size of a dog's.</p>

<p>Whilst this doesn't give too much detail we do see the weapons being used in the imagery and Hobb the Hewer slaying Shrykos with his axe.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bxpsi.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bxpsi.jpg"" alt=""Storming of the Dragonpit as depicted in the Histories &amp; Lore"" /></a></p>
<p>To get more detail into some of the deaths here we can look to book material to explain it further.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shrykos was the first dragon to succumb, slain by a woodsman known as Hobb the Hewer, who leapt onto her neck, driving his axe down into the beast’s skull as Shrykos roared and twisted, trying to throw him off. Seven blows did Hobb deliver with his legs locked round the dragon’s neck, and each time his axe came down he roared out the name of one of the Seven. It was the seventh blow, the Stranger’s blow, that slew the dragon, crashing through scale and bones into the beast’s brain.</p>
<p>Morghul, it is written, was slain by the Burning Knight, a huge brute of a man in heavy armor who rushed headlong into the dragon’s flame with spear in hand, thrusting its point into the beast’s eye repeatedly even as the dragonflame melted the steel plate that encased him and devoured the flesh within.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Many a conflicting tale is told of the death of the queen’s dragon. Some credit Hobb the Hewer and his axe, though this is almost certainly mistaken. Could the same man truly have slain two dragons on the same night and in the same manner? Some speak of an unnamed spearman, “a blood-soaked giant” who leapt from the Dragonpit’s broken dome onto the dragon’s back. Others relate how a knight named Ser Warrick Wheaton slashed a wing from Syrax with a Valyrian steel sword. A crossbowman named Bean would claim the kill afterward, boasting of it in many a wine sink and tavern, until one of the queen’s loyalists grew tired of his wagging tongue and cut it out. The truth of the matter no one will ever know—except that Syrax died that night.</p>

<p>Drogon also seems to get hurt by the wights that crawl on him in Season 8 Episode 3, &quot;The Long Night&quot; and similarly he is harmed by the arrows in Season 7 Episode 4, &quot;The Spoils of War&quot;, and Season 5 Episode 9, &quot;The Dance of Dragons&quot;, whilst protecting Dany in the fighting pits at Meereen.

<h3>Official Answer</h3>
<p>We simply do not know that. GRRM is deliberately vague about time, distances etc so we can't correctly figure out the rate on our own either. He merely at max gives us a vague idea by giving us a year and that's about it. And even the years are rare, most of the time he just doesn't discuss time so that fans couldn't find errors in his calculations. To Quote GRRM on distances and time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[How big is Westeros? Is it the size of Europe, or even larger?]</p>
<p>I have deliberately tried to be vague about such things, so I don't have obsessive fans with rulers measuring distances on the map and telling me Ned couldn't get from X to Y in the time I say he did.</p>
<p>However, if you really must know, you can figure out the distances for yourself. The Wall is a hundred leagues long. A league is three miles. Go from there.</p>
<p>But if you turn up any mistakes in travel times by using that measure, let it be your secret.<br><sub><em><a href=""https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/2787"" rel=""noreferrer"">Citadel - So Spake Martin</a></em></sub></p>

<h3>Speculation</h3>
<p>Let's take Joffrey Velaryon as the measuring stick here.</p>
<p>He was born in 117 AC at Dragonstone and a dragon egg was placed in his crib by command of his Royal Grandfather Viserys I. The dragon, named Tyraxes, hatched at some unknown point of time but it is estimated it was no later than 120 AC.</p>
<p>The Dance of the Dragon began in 129 AC, some 9 years after it, if we assume Tryaxes hatched in 120 AC. Bear in mind, Tyraxes was at Dragonstone, the place which was considered best for growth and health of dragons. Yet, after growing for 9 years, Tyraxes was still not old enough to fly to long distances alone<br><sup>1</sup> but it was large enough to carry the young Prince. It was however considered too young for war, unlike the dragons Arrax and Vermax which were bonded to Joffrey's older brothers. We do not know if Tyraxes' slower growth was because it hatched late or simply because Joffrey's brothers' dragons were more robust.</p>
<p>We do know from Daenerys' dragons that three dragons born at the same time can have different growth rate e.g. Drogon always ate more, was more daring and grew faster and larger. Rhaegel and Viserion were not that physically robust and certainly their captivity in Meereen didn't help.</p>
<p>In any case, I believe since Drogon had started flying off to long distances and by the end of ADWD, he was large enough to carry Daenerys to the skies, he must have been slightly larger or at least the same size as Tyraxes was when the war began. Drogon, we do know, was born somewhere in 299 AC. We know Daenerys took Meereen within the same year. Tyraxes took 9 years to grow to that size, that too in the environment considered best for dragons. Drogon seems to have grown nearly that much, if not more within one to two years given that Daenerys' flight happens in Meereen, after second siege of Astapor which happened in 300 AC.</p>
<p>But it is possible that Tyraxes is the wrong measuring tape here, we perhaps should have used Arrax or Vermax for comparison with Drogon since Arrax and Vermax showed faster growth despite being born at more or less the same time as Tyraxes. And not to mention another flawed premise in our calculation, while Tyraxes could take Prince Joffrey to skies after 9 years, that doesn't necessarily mean that the first flight occurred after 9 years. So when did Prince Joffrey first flew atop his dragon? So now let's look at Joffrey's half brother Aegon the Younger (Later Aegon III). Aegon was born in 120 AC and just like his brothers, an egg was placed in his crib, which hatched into a Dragon named Stormcloud. When the war broke out 9 years later, the Prince had bonded with the dragon but hadn't flown since the Dragon was too small for him. The Prince's solo flight with his dragon was when he desperately clutch to his bleeding dragon's neck in order to escape from the attacking fleets of the Kingdom of Three Daughters. So after 9 years, Stormcloud still wasn't old enough to serve as a proper mount for Aegon III. But OTOH, we do not know when Stormcloud was hatched.</p>
<p>In any case, even if the dragons Tyraxes and Stormcloud weren't born in 120 AC and we are off by a few years, one thing seems clear, <strong>Daenerys' dragons have grown faster than other dragons</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<p><sub><strong>1.</strong> Not deemed suitable to fly alone without a rider seems more of a comment on fear of losing a dragon rather than its inability to fly as such. A riderless young dragon presumably seeks out new lairs just as Drogon did with the hill in Dothraki sea that Dany dubbed her Dragonstone. Older dragons, I suppose, can be trusted to return back to the lair they are used to  even if they are riderless i.e. Dragonstone or King's Landing. Dragons are solitary animals and they do not have a herd behaviour. In the Wild, Dragons live alone, presumably seeking company only to mate.</sub></p>

"212679","Why did Varys explain his plans to Tyrion, even after it was clear he was unwilling?","<p>I've always seen Varys as a pragmatist. He let Ned die instead of saving him because he understands you cannot always do what is ""right."" So why didn't he backtrack after Tyrion told him he was loyal to Dany?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","212682","<p>At that time, Tyrion hadn't decided which camp he belonged in and Varys was recruiting. Support of the Hand of the Queen would have been crucial in the designs he had. After all if he'd succeeded in removing Daenerys by assassination, <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/212369/who-has-the-authority-to-call-for-a-great-council/212399#212399"">the power would have fallen intp Tyrion's hands</a> as Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm and Lord Regent during the interregnum. </p>

<p>Varys was still hopeful by the end of that exchange that Tyrion might agree to join him as evident by his parting note. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>VARYS:</strong> I've served tyrants most of my life. They all talk about destiny.</p>
  
  <p><strong>TYRION:</strong> She's a girl who walked into a fire with three stones and walked out with three dragons. How could she not believe in destiny? </p>
  
  <p><strong>VARYS:</strong> Perhaps that's the problem. Her life has convinced her that she was sent here to save us all.</p>
  
  <p><strong>TYRION:</strong> And how do you know she wasn't? </p>
  
  <p>[Varys seems he doesn't have any answer before he changes the tack]</p>
  
  <p><strong>VARYS:</strong> Then there's the problem of Jon Snow. Perhaps it's actually a solution. You know them both. Tell me, who do you think would make a
  better ruler? </p>
  
  <p><strong>TYRION:</strong> He doesn't want the throne. That's why he bent the knee.</p>
  
  <p><strong>VARYS:</strong> Have you considered the best ruler might be someone who doesn't want to rule? </p>
  
  <p><strong>TYRION:</strong> We're discussing treason.</p>
  
  <p><strong>VARYS:</strong> Don't pretend you haven't thought about it.</p>
  
  <p><strong>TYRION:</strong> Of course I've thought about it. Thoughts aren't treason.</p>
  
  <p><strong>VARYS:</strong> He's temperate and measured. He's a man, which makes him more appealing to the lords of Westeros, whose support we are going to
  need.</p>
  
  <p><strong>TYRION:</strong> Joffrey was a man. I don't think a cock is a true qualification, as I'm sure you'd agree.</p>
  
  <p><strong>VARYS:</strong> And he's the heir to the throne. Yes, because he's a man. Cocks are important, I'm afraid.</p>
  
  <p>[Now Tyrion has no answer so he changes the tack]</p>
  
  <p><strong>TYRION:</strong> What about my earlier proposal? They could rule together as king and queen.</p>
  
  <p><strong>VARYS:</strong> She's too strong for him. She'd bend him to her will, as she already has.</p>
  
  <p><strong>TYRION:</strong> He could temper her worst impulses.</p>
  
  <p><strong>VARYS:</strong> As you have? You're drinking quite a lot. A Targaryen father and a Stark mother. Jon's the one man alive who might actually
  be able to keep the North in the Seven Kingdoms.</p>
  
  <p><strong>TYRION:</strong> How many kings and queens have you served? Five? Six? I've lost count.</p>
  
  <p><strong>VARYS:</strong> You've always known my reasons.</p>
  
  <p><strong>TYRION:</strong> At a certain point, you choose a person you believe in, and you fight for that person.</p>
  
  <p><strong>VARYS:</strong> Even if you know it's a mistake? </p>
  
  <p><strong>TYRION:</strong> I believe in our queen. She'll make the right choice. With the help of her loyal advisors.</p>
  
  <p><strong>VARYS:</strong> You know where my loyalty stands. You know I will never betray the realm.</p>
  
  <p><strong>TYRION:</strong> What is the realm? A vast continent, home to millions of people, most of whom don't care who sits on the Iron Throne. </p>
  
  <p><strong>VARYS:</strong> Millions of people, many of whom will die if the wrong person sits on that throne. We don't know their names, but they're
  just as real as you and I. They deserve to live. They deserve food for
  their children. I will act in their interest, no matter the personal
  cost.</p>
  
  <p><strong>TYRION:</strong> So, what happens to her? </p>
  
  <p>[Varys looks at Tyrion in a way that implies that Tyrion knows the
  answer - She'll die]</p>
  
  <p><strong>TYRION:</strong> Please. Don't.</p>
  
  <p><strong>VARYS:</strong> I've spoken as honestly as I can. Each of us has a choice to make. I pray we choose wisely.<br><sub><strong><em>S08 E04 - The Last of the Starks</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice this conversation. Varys cautiously begins by talking about Tyrants to judge which side does Tyrion stand on. After that he tries to reason that Daenerys' troubled life might be the reason she might become a tyrant in her zeal to save people who don't need saving. Tyrion proves his loyalty by asking him how does he know that Daenerys really isn't meant to save everyone? Varys has no answer so he tries to come at it from a different direction. </p>

<p>Now he starts talking about Jon Snow being the possible solution. Tyrion reluctantly and implicitly admits that Jon might be better but he doesn't want the throne. Varys becomes more confident by this small victory, and tries to push the point. Tyrion warns him that what he's saying is treason. Varys, still hopeful that he was making progress in turning Tyrion to his side, keeps pushing. To further reinforce his point, he enumerates Jon's virtues and points out that he's after all the heir to throne as both Rhaegar's and Daenerys' heir.</p>

<p>Tyrion seems troubled so he asks Varys one more time about binding the two Targaryens in bond of marriage so that they may both share the throne. Varys rejects his proposal once again by claiming that Jon's too weak for Daenerys and she's already bent to him to her will. Even if they wed Jon to Daenerys, it will still be Daenerys who would rule. Tyrion however hoped that he might be able to control her, Varys counters that Tyrion himself couldn't control her. Now he seems to plead to Tyrion by talking about integrity of the realm and saving the union of seven Kingdoms. </p>

<p>Tyrion gets visibly agitated and annoyed at Varys' persistence since it is clear to him now that Varys means to do something and it is not just idle talk the way it began. He accuses him of being a habitual turncloak who's unable to keep faith in anyone. Varys then implores the humanitarian side and says that millions of people will die if the wrong person sits on the throne. </p>

<p>Tyrion weighs it in his mind, seemingly he seems to be in agreement about removing the Queen from the throne. But in what manner? That's what he asks Varys. Varys implies she'd die. At that Tyrion explicitly tells Varys that he won't stand by it. Abdication? Maybe. A coup? Perhaps. But assassination? Tyrion won't support her murder. </p>

<p>Varys however is still hopeful that he may have in fact swayed Tyrion. After all murder is just one step away from forcing a monarch to abdicate. If Tyrion seemed okay with the coup, he'd accept murder as fait accompli. So before leaving, Varys tells Tyrion that they both have a choice to make and he hopes that Tyrion chooses wisely. No doubt in his mind Varys thought Tyrion would make the choice to stand with him or at least he'll choose not to interfere. But Tyrion had made up his mind right after Varys implied murder. Still, Tyrion did not go to Daenerys just then. He wanted Varys to repent his treason quietly but then he saw Varys speaking to Jon alone suspiciously. Tyrion knew now he had no choice but to go to Daenerys. It was better for him personally if Daenerys heard about the plot from him rather than Jon Snow.</p>

<p>Since then Wilko has done a few tours so it’s possible there were scheduling conflicts if they did ever want to bring him back and just couldn’t.</p>
<p>I think as of Season 8 Episode 5, “The Bells”, we can assume he died in the attack on King’s Landing if he doesn’t appear in the final episode which seems unlikely.</p>

","<game-of-thrones>","212862","<p>The other answers overlook something very neat and simple: the Starks were the last to speak. </p>

<p>Sansa deliberately waited until all the others had said ""Aye"". Everyone (including most viewers, I imagine) assumed she would say ""Aye"" to her own brother becoming king - but she waited until everyone else had committed before making her move.</p>

<p>This was very smart. Bran's position was essentially confirmed, so her little power play wouldn't stop Bran being king, and it meant that if anyone else had wanted to copy her, they would have to publicly contradict themselves and publicly go against their own word. </p>

<p>She waited until they had all committed to accepting Bran as their king before putting the idea of breaking away into their heads and revealing it was something Bran would likely agree to in order to maintain peace. There were clear shots of her watching the others, smiling confidently, looking around making sure everyone else had spoken, waiting for the right moment.</p>

<p>She learned a lot about politics from Littlefinger and Cersei over the years...</p>

<hr>

<p>Of course, if there had been someone like Tywin Lannister present, he would not have been caught flat-footed like the others were. He'd have smelled someone consolidating power and he'd have known that he had about five seconds between Sansa making this play and Bran accepting it to put Sansa's ambitions down. </p>

<p>He'd probably have quickly made the calculation that Sansa cares more about peace and having a mild king like Bran than she cares about independence. He'd have used his extensive political wits to quickly think up a powerful way of putting Sansa under the pressure of thinking that the whole deal would fall through if she didn't back down. He'd also have found a way of presenting it <em>without</em> making enemies of the others present, risking them allying against him in future, and without appearing to have gone back on his word, risking appearing weak and losing credibility. </p>

<p>Edmure Tully, Gendry, Royce, Yara, Sam, Davos... these are not characters with the same political instincts and wits, or ambitions. </p>

<p>Of those present, only Tyrion could realistically have responded effectively here, but he's not going to bluff bringing down his own suggestion, when it looks like his last chance to save himself from Grey Worm's dagger.</p>

<p>It would be perfectly in character for, say, Yara to sail home kicking herself that if she'd played her cards better, maybe she might have wrangled independence for the Iron Islands. It would not be in character for her to magically transform into a master politician and masterfully improvise her way to it in a matter of seconds, or take big risks in a clumsy, improvised power grab when, unlike Sansa, she had been perfectly happy supporting Queen Dany.</p>

The fact that Drogon is still out there, and Jon has been a dragon rider, would only make people even more paranoid.</p>

<p>What Jon's allies did was, in fact, a successful con job. By sentencing him to the Night Watch, they removed him from any claim on the throne thus no one would have reason to see him as a threat. And most people don't know that he was happy (before all hell broke out) living among the Wildlings in the far north, and given the events of the series, the survivors there are utterly loyal to him.

<p><sub>Speaking specifically of Aegon III, he was not that old himself. He was 11 when he married his cousin Jaehaera Targaryen (Who was 8). After her death, he was 13 when he married Daenaera Velaryon. A completely negligible difference in ages. Besides, his first wedding was political to bind the Greens and Blacks together after horrific civil war. His second wedding was simply because his sisters brokered the match and because he liked Daenaera more than other maidens at the Ball. Both weddings were obviously not consummated (1 never at all since Jaehaera died, and second presumably much much later even after Daenaera became an adult since the King hated being touched even by her and kept separate chambers).</sub></p>

<p>It's safe to say that as he hasn't died that his purpose is unfulfilled. Maybe he'll become the King beyond the Wall and lead the free folk, they certainly seem to trust him. Or maybe he'll die on the trip to a suitable place. We don't know what his end purpose is because we don't see it.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Six Kingdoms</p>

<p>but there are still </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> eight kingdoms remaining from the original nine ""Seven Kingdoms"" (Dorne, Westerlands, Crownlands, The Reach, Iron Islands, Vale, Riverlands, Stormlands)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, why not just keep the name?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","212951","<p>The crownlands and the iron islands are not kingdoms.</p>

<p>The name seven kingdoms originates from the seven kingdoms, which existed before Aegon's conquest. These are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kingdom of the North (Stark)</li>
<li>Kingdom of Mountain and Vale (Arryn)</li>
<li>Kingdom of Isles and Rivers (Hoare)</li>
<li>Kingdom of Rock (Lannister)</li>
<li>Kingdom of the Reach (Gardener)</li>
<li>Kingdom of Storm (Durrandon)</li>
<li>Principality of Dorne (Martell)</li>
</ul>

<p>The iron islands were part of the Kingdom of Isles and rivers, House Hoare hailed from there and conquered the riverlands a century or so before Aegon's conquest from the Storm Kingdom. House Hoare was virtually destroyed in the conquest. Aegon divided the Kingdom of Isles and Rivers into the Iron Islands and the Riverlands and gave two local houses Greyjoy (selected by the ironborn themselves) and Tully (the first house to rebel against Hoare) control as his Lords Paramount. </p>

<p>What is now the crownlands was a constant warzone between the Reach, the Rivers and the Stormlands vying for control over this area, as such it was a prime spot for establishing a beachhead in Westeros. After the conquest, Aegon declared this land Crownlands and founded the capital there. </p>

<p>The name seven kingdoms however still originates from those seven kingdoms, which were there before Aegon, he did not include the two constituencies he created in that. The North was one of those original seven kingdoms, since it's independent now, by all rights, it's now the six kingdoms.</p>

<p>Note that the ""Seven Kingdoms"" were already only six for the most part of their history. Aegon still called himself Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, as he always laid claim to Dorne. But Dorne didn't come to the fold until 200 years after the conquest, so only 100 years before the show, after marrying into House Targaryen.  Which makes it also a questionable choice of the showrunners for Dorne not to demand their independence as well.</p>

<p>How can the King send people to the Wall while it is not in his kingdom? And what could he do if they decide to stay in the North with Sansa instead?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","212957","<p>Your premise is flawed. Neither The Wall or the Watch are a part of the North. They answer to no Kings and owe no fealty to anyone. </p>

<p>Before the Conquest, Watch was manned collectively by men of all the Kingdoms. It still is. It is the shield that guards the <strong>realms of men</strong>, it doesn't guard one realm and owes no allegiance to any realm. It serves everyone and protects everyone.</p>

<p>If you want an explicit example, Princess Nymeria sent <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Nymeria%27s_War"" rel=""noreferrer"">her six rival Kings</a> to the wall in golden chains once she completed her conquest and brought whole Dorne under the rule of House Nymeros-Martell. Needless to say, North as an Independent Kingdom existed back then and the Wall was definitely not in Principality of Dorne's control.</p>

<p>Of course as you say, Sansa can try and pry away Jon, and Jon can try to escape. After all, Aegor Rivers, commonly known as 'Bittersteel' was rescued when his ship en-route to the Watch was intercepted by his friends. But will Sansa commit such a dishonourable act? Brandon will be forced to enforce his will or his word would count for less. Will Jon be willing to do that? He never wanted anything to do with the politics and administration, he's going home for all he cares. And if Jon does desert or escape, Sansa will have to execute him/hand him back to the watch if he deserts, try to capture him if he escapes. Otherwise Stark honour means for less. </p>

<p>And What happens if the Word reaches the Unsullied that they were played for a fool and their Queen's murderer now sits beside his sister in Winterfell? You can expect Yara Greyjoy, who sided openly with Greyworm, would definitely make sure that the word does reach them. With Ironborn descending from the West and Unsullied from the East, North would be smashed even if Bran takes no hand. Doing so will also give Yara the allies she needs to win her independence with fire and steel after Sansa tricked them all into accepting her brother as King, in case she resents that and wishes to fulfil her father's mission. Giving Jon refuge will:</p>

<ol>
<li>Dishonour Starks</li>
<li>Make Sansa look weak and unjust</li>
<li>Put the North in risk of a conflict with the Six Kingdoms and the Unsullied.</li>

"7183","Why did Robb attack Tywin Lannister's Army at the same time as his surprise attack on Jaime?","<p>In Game of Thrones, Robb Stark decides on a two-pronged attack against the two Lannister armies. He sends a small force to move quickly and attack the main Lannister army, led by Lord Tywin, head-on, resulting in massive casualties to that subdivision of the Northern army. </p>

<p>At the same time, he takes most of his Northern army and lures Jaime Lannister away from his siege of Riverrun, capturing him in the battle of Whispering Wood (leading to the subsequent routing of Jaime's army).</p>

<p>If the success of his strategy hinged on capturing Jaime (which he was able to do), then why did he attack Tywin at the same time? </p>

<p>It is not as if Tywin could warn Jaime that he was being attacked by the main Stark-led army (leading Jaime to believe that he was safe from the Northerners), since Jaime could not receive any messenger ravens (as he did not have a fixed point to which they could be sent) - and we do not see Tywin send warning in any event. And in any event, Robb is quite successful in masking his movements from Jaime.</p>

<p>If he just wanted to prevent Tywin from coming swiftly to counter-attack Robb once word got to him about the capture of Jaime, that doesn't make sense either, since:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tywin had no easy way to get there, once Robb allied himself with the Freys (who controlled the main river crossing)</li>
<li>Robb could have stationed his secondary force in ambush along the route that Tywin would have had to take. This would probably have been more efficient than the direct assault of an overmatched Northerner force against the Lannister army</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems that the book portrays Robb's decision to split his forces in this way as a key to the success of his victory and capture of Jaime Lanister in Whispering Wood. In so doing, he knowingly sacrificed most of the force sent against Tywin Lannister. But why did he need to do this? He could still have gotten Jaime without attacking Tywin directly, and kept a larger number of his soldiers and bannermen alive or uncaptured in the process? What am I missing?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><warfare><geography>","131147","<p>System Down has sufficiently answered this question. </p>

<p>This is merely to add graphical representation to add more clarity to the situation.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Situation before the crossing</h2>

<p>Before Robb made his crossing of the Trident, the situation was following.</p>

<ol>
<li>Jaime's host had besieged Riverrun from multiple directions. (Shown as three hosts because Riverrun had to be besieged by three different sides)</li>
<li>Robb Stark was stuck North of trident at The Twins, trying to figure out a way to break siege of Riverrun.</li>
<li>Tywin Lannister had occupied the Ruby Ford and made the Inn at Crossroads his headquarter.</li>
</ol>

<p>At that point, Walder Frey was neutral and had kinship with Casterly Rock due to marriage between Lord Tywin's sister Genna and Lord Walder's son Emmon. Siezing the initiative, Tywin occupied the ruby ford and sat firmly on the Kingsroad to repulse a Stark attempt to cross the river from there and outflank Jaime's host. By occupying that point, he also made sure that if Arryns bestirred, they would have to fight him before they ever get to Riverlands.</p>

<p>Tyrion joined his father at the Crossroads inn when he got free from Eyrie.</p>

<p>Following map will show you exact positions of all hosts:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vmk9G.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vmk9G.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>As you can see, If Robb moved against Jaime directly, Tywin would have marched quickly southwards across the ford, then cut Westward until they crossed the red fork and then together Jaime and Tywin could finish Robb. So Robb had to secure his flank and rear from Tywin and also had to relieve Riverrun. Instead of staking everything on one battle, Robb chose to divide his men and tie Tywin in Ruby ford while he could smash Jaime's host freely using mobility of his Cavalry.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Situation After the Crossing</h2>

<p>As it turned out, Freys joined Robb. Robb took most of his Cavalry and crossed on Southern Bank of the Twins. He was going to ride fast and hard to Riverrun and take Jaime unaware. He gave command of his foot to Roose Bolton who struck South-East along the Kingsroad to engage Tywin Lannister at Ruby Ford and deny him the chance to aid Jaime. </p>

<p>Tywin failed to know about the split and Ser Addam Marbrand, commander of the Lannister outriders only managed to report about movement of Bolton's troops, which Tywin mistook to be main Stark body under command of Robb Stark. Following was the location of Armies after the crossing:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/k2ucc.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/k2ucc.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<hr>

<h2>Battles At Greenfork and Whispering Wood</h2>

<p>Robb's plan was successful. Bolton distracted Tywin long enough to allow Robb to defeat Jaime in Battle of Whispering Wood. Starks suffered heavy losses at Green Fork however they succeeded in delaying Tywin's aid to Jaime. Tywin failed to give a chase to survivors of Bolton's Army because he wanted to help Jaime in his siege.</p>

<p>Following is the map of Battles:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JbFNS.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/JbFNS.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>As you can see, Tywin was stuck a long distance away, thinking that he was fighting Robb Stark. He was unaware that Robb had captured Jaime. Robb's simultaneous attacks in East and West had succeeded in achieving their ultimate objectives. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Aftermath</h2>

<p>Robb, now unopposed in West, quickly follows up on his victory and launches a surprise attack on Armies besieging Riverrun. In Battle of Camps, Lannister suffered a crushing defeat as leaderless Armies of captive Jaime Lannister were destroyed in their camps amidst a lot of confusion and disarray.</p>

<p>Tywin Lannister soon learns of these developments and retreats to Harrenhal to avoid encirclement by possible allied Baratheon-Stark forces and to be in a defensible position from where he could move to attack Starks or defend KL from a Baratheon attack. Roose Bolton moves to occupy Ruby Fork which was an extremely valuable position from strategic point of view as Possible allied Arryn Forces would have needed it to enter Riverlands and any Lannister adventure(However unlikely given the experience of Tywin and Kevan) northward to threaten Vale or North would have to pass from there.. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cj8FS.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/cj8FS.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>So as evident, due to his simultaneous attack on Tywin Lannister and Jaime Lannister, Robb achieved following results:</p>

<ol>
<li>He tied Tywin down where he was unable to bail Jaime out.</li>
<li>He broke siege of Riverrun and destroyed a substantial part of Lannister power.</li>
<li>He made Tywin retreat to Harrenhal. </li>
<li>He won over Riverlords to his side by defending their lands and freeing Edmure Tully. </li>
<li>He blocked Lannister path to threaten North &amp; Vale by securing the Ruby Ford &amp; Twins.</li>
<li>He was now poised to attack the Lannisters in their own lands in the West, with the only Lannister Army trapped in Harrenhal with enemies on all compass points; Robb in West, Bolton in North, Renly and his Baratheon-Tyrell forces in South and Stannis Baratheon in the east.</li>

<p>Lastly, we know Lords and Ladies can knight someone, as Stannis did to Ser Davos for smuggling the onions into Storm's End under the siege. It's possible that as Podrick was Tyrion's squire for a while and Tyrion was quite fond of him he also could have knighted him.</p>

<p>In either case it doesn't matter, Daenerys won the war and became Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, it does not matter that she never made it to the coronation. Once she was queen she could pass it through as law and fact.</p>

<p>And anyway, those on the Great Council are also those that would support Gendry as a Baratheon and his claim to Storm's End, there would be nothing to gain really by questioning it. In fact it would only likely turn people against you rather than with you.</p>

  <p>Bran,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>2 have only weak reasons, and 1 more doesn't vote for him. But somehow he gets elected.</p>

<p><strong>Why did each of the electors vote the way they did?</strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones>","213076","<h2>Because it makes the nobility stronger</h2>

<p>The reason that they're so in favor of this, even universally so, is that this is (seemingly) great for the nobility (i.e. those very same electors). What they are essentially doing is trading a system where the queen or king of the realm has total control over the power of succession for one where the nobility controls it. This dramatically increases their own powers: a king or queen cannot antagonize the nobility nearly as much without fear of losing the succession of their children or other favored successor, which gives the nobility a more flexible lever than the threat of rebellion to argue for their own interests. It also implicitly situates the ruler as ruling by the consent of their nobles, making it potentially easier for the nobles to remove a less favored ruler if the occasion arises. In other words: a weaker ruler means stronger nobles. </p>

<p>We can see this in what they say that the meeting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bran <strong>has no interest in ruling</strong> and he can't father children. Good.
  Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid, as you well know. <strong>His will
  never torment us</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That he has no interest in ruling is presented as a positive because the nobility does not want him to have the traditional measure of control. If they were afraid that the lack of a determined monarch would bring chaos, they wouldn't see this as a good thing. </p>

<p>A system where the nobility is more powerful is also a system where kingdoms with pretensions to independence, such as the Iron Islands or Dorne, can more easily pursue it, and possibly even with an eventual legal argument on their side. </p>

<p>And what's more, Bran has no objection to this, whereas <strong>any <em>other</em> ruler, who would be able to have children or even be more invested in temporal rules and traditions than Bran, would naturally object</strong> to their heirs not being able to inherit. </p>

<p>If any of them don't yet understand the scope of Bran's powers and still see him as weak (mentally or otherwise), they also may well see him as likely to allow them to take more power for themselves. </p>

<h2>Because he'll be a good ruler</h2>

<p>If any of them do care somewhat about the quality of the person who's in charge of the realm, as even a self-interested noble should, since their people's success is to some extent their own, and they actually understand what Bran is capable of, then they should support him. </p>

<p>With his unique powers, he brings a lot of talents to the table. Militarily, he can foresee troop movements with a precision accessible to no other ruler, through greensight and warging. In terms of arbitration, he will be fair and honest, because of his personality and because of his ability to know what lies behind a dispute. In terms of his ability to keep the realm together, no one will dare speak of open rebellion once his abilities become known, for fear that he'll be aware of it. With his knowledge of what's happening throughout the realm, he will be an unparalleled administrator. He also seems quite intelligent, if aloof, and not unstable like, I don't know, the last three rulers?</p>

Lord Janos had been gaining, true, creeping up past first Bowen Marsh and then Othell Yarwyck, but he was still well behind Ser Denys Mallister of the Shadow Tower and Cotter Pyke of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. One of them will be the new Lord Commander, surely, Sam told himself.<br>

<h1>Volantis</h1>

<p>The Volantese also have elections, but there is no universal right to vote. These officials are elected for short terms.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The triarchs are neither kings nor princes. Volantis is a freehold, like Valyria of old. All freeborn landholders share the rule. Even women are allowed to vote, provided they own land. The three triarchs are chosen from amongst those noble families who can prove unbroken descent from old Valyria, to serve until the first day of the new year. And you would know all this if you had troubled to read the book that Maester Kedry gave you.""<br>

<h1>Iron Islands (sometimes)</h1>

<p>When they feel like it, the Ironborn of the Iron Islands elect their king in a Kingsmoot. Similarly to the Night's Watch it is questionable whether electing someone to rule as ""tyrant"" is really democracy, but it's another example of ""voting for your ruler"" as Sam intended.</p>

"145418","Is the Westerosi civilization in decline?","<p>After reading this question <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/20944/why-is-it-that-after-8-000-years-technology-in-westeros-has-not-evolved-in-the"">Why is it that after 8,000 years, technology in Westeros has not evolved in the world of the Game of Thrones?</a>, and of course reading the books, I asked myself if we could say the Westerosi civilization is ending.</p>

<p>Some elements :</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<p>They seem to not be able to build great castles as well as they used to, or even repair destroyed castles like <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Harrenhal"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Harrenhal</a>. Most of the castles were built hundreds of years ago (maybe thousands) and I don't think they could manage these projects <em>today</em>.</p>

<h2>Magic</h2>

<p>People have lost Magic knowledge and its usage is discouraged; for example Qyburn as the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Citadel"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Citadel</a> avoids this knowledge and denies its efficiency. Another example is Skinchanging, only known for a few people in the North but most of Southerners is unaware of this magic.</p>

<h2>Books</h2>

<p>Again, I'm not sure, but it seems they are not able to print books anymore. The books that are stated seem old and about old and almost forgotten or boring subjects. While sailing to Braavos, Sam brings rare books to the Citadel, noting that they are in urge of books, collecting all books they can.
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_LKr2PoR3Y"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Some guy even dislikes books.</a></p>

<h2>Animals</h2>

<p>Many species have disapeared. <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Leaf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Leaf</a> said :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Now [the Sun] sinks, and this is our long dwindling. The giants are almost gone as well, they who were our bane and our brothers. The <strong>great lions</strong> of the western hills have been slain, the <strong>unicorns</strong> are all but gone, the <strong>mammoths</strong> down to a few hundred. The <strong>direwolves</strong> will outlast us all, but their time will come as well. In the world that men have made, there is no room for them, or us.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, I would like to ask if there are other exemples of forgotten knowledge.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","145421","<p>I agree that technology and progression in the world of A Song of Ice and Fire does seem stagnant - which as @Cearon O'Flynn mentioned in the comments, is a <em>very</em> common fantasy trope.</p>

<p>There are some in-universe explanations for the way things currently stand though:</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<p>Harrenhal is a particularly good example for this.<br>
It was built by Harren the Black purposefully built Harrenhal to be the biggest, most impressive fortress that had ever been created, as a not-so-subtle challenge to the authority of Aegon Targaryen. 
And Aegon burned him and his family alive inside it for his impudence.<br>
This is related to Arya by Tywin <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1v3fRfJBRk"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.
The lesson here is that the ruling nobility have made a conscious effort to keep those under their authority in line by force - this stifles too much defensive construction, as it could be seen as an effort to refuse their rule, and would be treated with great displeasure.<br>
You might also look to the Wall as an example of lost construction ability, but this involved a great deal of magic to build in addition to mundane building, which leads me to...</p>

<h2>Magic</h2>

<p>Your examples surrounding magic are unfortuantely a little incomplete.<br>
Skinchanging is a magic that was used by the Children of the Forest - one of the indigenous peoples of Westeros who had a great connection to the land and to nature - and were not human.<br>
Those who currently have the ability are those who have blood of the First Men, who likely interbred to a greater or lesser degree with the Children after the <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/The_Pact"" rel=""noreferrer"">Pact</a> was formed.<br>
The First Men had the greatest concentration in the North, and so the remnants of their bloodlines also lies there.</p>

<p>Qyburn was expelled from the Citadel for any number of practices seen to be distasteful - magic, yes, but also science. He conducts experiments on cadavers and performs other questionable practices, exploring darker knowledge than the Citadel aims to disseminate.<br>
Worth noting is that the Citadel itself studies magic - Maester Lewin and Bran <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sup-uOawuGw"" rel=""noreferrer"">discuss this</a>, and Lewin notes that he himself attempted to study magic, but found he did not possess the aptitude for it.</p>

<p>Finally, the reason for the theft of Daenerys's dragons in Qarth is that the presence of dragons in the world strengthens the power of magic - while dragons were seen to be extinct magic largely disappeared as a result. It's not as well covered in the show, but in the books there is mention that Melisandre's visions likely started with the hatching of Daenerys's dragons, as with Thoros of Myr's ability to revive Beric Dondarrion, and the warlocks in Qarth themselves being able to perform magic above simple parlour tricks.</p>

<h2>Books</h2>

<p>This one should be able to be attributes simply to their technology - they are at a technological level roughly equal to that of our Medieval Age.<br>
Literacy and availability of books didn't take off in our own world until the invention of the printing press - until that point books had to be produced individually by hand by scribes, making them incredibly painstaking to distribute. It also meant that it was unusual for there to be more than one copy of a given book, giving rise to great libraries (like the Citadel itself).</p>

<p>As said, their technology is stagnant, for fantasy handwavium reasons, as well as in-universe oppression, but surrounding that your given examples are explainable in and out of universe.</p>

<p>I'm going to add in a category of my own here as well:</p>

<h2>Economy</h2>

<p>As is stated in both the show and the books, Westeros is <em>heavily</em> in debt to various lenders, both in the forms of Houses like the Lannisters and the Tyrells, but also to the Iron Bank of Braavos.<br>
So, simply put, there isn't the budget for massive works to be constructed when the country as a whole (at least in terms of the government as a whole) is poor.</p>

<p>When you get outside Westeros there are plenty of notable constructions - the Pyramid of Meereen, the Titan of Braavos, even the Dothraki have the great bronze horse statues at the Horse Gate of Vaes Dothrak - and there is no evidence given that these couldn't be replicated given time and motivation, the only difference here is money.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Worth noting as well, is that a lot of the technological development that was carried out may have been lost along the way due to certain events - the one that springs to mind first and foremost is the secret to forging Valyrian Steel.<br>
Nobody has been able to reproduce the process to outright create it since the <a href=""http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Doom_of_Valyria"" rel=""noreferrer"">Doom of Valyria</a>, and there is no record of what other knowledge was lost in the same cataclysm - it's entirely possible that advanced methods of construction and other technological leaps were also lost in the same way.</p>

"213126","Is the Unsullied name meant to be ironic? How did it come to be?","<p>By definition, <em>sully</em> means to tarnish, stain, blemish, disgrace, dishonor, etc. When Daenerys first inquires about how the Unsullied are trained, the merchant has Missandei explain how every soldier is first trained, degraded and punished until they're fully obedient to their master and don't fear death (i.e., have no desire to value their own life). Even the names they're given are meant to be a reminder of how their lives mean nothing, not to mention that they're all also castrated...</p>

<p>Given this, there seems to be a kind of irony here. That, the group known as Unsullied (without tarnish, dishonor, blemish, etc.) is made by completely sullying every member until they're basically stripped of all humanity. </p>

<p>So my question is, how did the Unsullied get their name? Is it meant to be ironic?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","213129","<p><strong>They are unsullied by temptation.</strong></p>
<p>One of the selling points (literally) of the Unsullied is their unfailing devotion. They will not betray the one they serve, not for money or love or greed or lust. Presumably this is what the name refers to. The sullying of their manliness, or the possible sullying of their souls by removing instincts such as mercy or compassion during the training process which involves murdering babies and their own pet dogs, is unlikely to be something their trainers or owners care about. The name is chosen to reflect their positive aspects (from the point of view of those selling them), not anything more human.</p>

<p>Why doesn't Euron get angry? Even if he's not the most clever character, he must realize that if Tyrion knows Cersei is expecting that means she got pregnant <em>before</em> Tyrion left King's Landing, and so before she slept with Euron.</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","213151","<p>DariM makes an commendable effort. However the canonical answer as given by director David Nutter is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What did Euron think when Tyrion revealed that he knew about Cersei’s baby?</strong></p>
<p>In the episode, Cersei (Lena Headey) tells Euron (Pilou Asbæk) that he is the father of her unborn baby for the first time we see on-screen. There’s no 23andMe in Westeros, so Captain Jack Sparrow Euron buys it ― having no idea that Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) is the child’s actual father.</p>
<p>They’re one big, happy, murderous family for about two minutes until the army of Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) meets with Cersei at the gates of King’s Landing. Tyrion (Peter Dinklage) tries to plead with his sister to surrender, begging her to do it for the life of her child.</p>
<p>But wait.</p>
<p>Since Euron just found out about the baby, and he’s standing right behind Cersei in the scene, wouldn’t he question how Tyrion knew this information? That’s what fans were wondering after the episode.</p>
<p>For Nutter, the scene wasn’t really about that.</p>
<p>“I think Euron, he’s not paying that much attention,” Nutter said, explaining that the scene was more about Tyrion appealing to Cersei’s softer side.</p>
<p>Apparently, Tyrion wanted Cersei to “realize that she wasn’t a monster at all, that she was really, truly a mother.”</p>
<p>“That was an intense scene,” Nutter continued. “I think any type of Euron intrusion there would’ve weakened the intent of what we were trying to tell.”</p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tyrion_Lannister"" rel=""noreferrer"">Tyrion Lannister</a></strong></p>

<p>There are many hints that Tyrion's father is actually Aerys II Targaryen, not Tywin Lannister. Aerys was infatuated with Joanna Lannister, Tyrion's mother, and Tywin sent her back to Casterly Rock to keep her away from Aerys. But she came back to King's Landing for a big tourney the year before Tyrion was born. Tyrion's hair is not Lannister yellow-blond, it's so pale that it's almost white -- or perhaps Targaryen silver. He has one green eye (normal for Lannisters) and one black eye -- or is it dark violet? And Tyrion being a secret Targaryen would fit well with the ""Dragon must have three heads"" prophecy.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Martell"" rel=""noreferrer"">House Martell</a></strong></p>

<p>Every living Martell (probably; Manfrey is not quite clear) has Targaryen ancestry. An earlier Daenerys Targaryen, a legitimate daughter of Aegon IV ""The Unworthy"" married Maron Martell and the current Martells are their descendants. In the books, that's Doran, Oberyn, Manfrey, Arianne and Trystane Martell, and the numerous Sand Snakes who are Oberyn's illegitimate offspring.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Plumm"" rel=""noreferrer"">House Plumm</a></strong></p>

<p>Every living member of House Plumm (I'm going to say that clearly includes ""Brown Ben"" Plumm of the Second Sons, since the dragons like him) also has Targaryen ancestry. Ossifer Plumm married Elaena Targaryen, daughter of Aegon III and sister to Baelor I and Daeron I. Besides Brown Ben, we know of Philip Plumm and his three sons Dennis, Peter and Harwyn.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rennifer_Longwaters"" rel=""noreferrer"">Rennifer Longwaters</a></strong></p>

<p>Descended from Daemon Blackfyre, one of the legitimised ""Great Bastards"" of Aegon IV. The male line is extinct, but it seems likely that there are Blackfyre descendants in the female line in Essos, though we don't know of any.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Baratheon"" rel=""noreferrer"">House Baratheon</a></strong></p>

<p>Stannis Baratheon is still alive (or at least missing and only unreliably reported dead) in the books, and his grandmother was Rhaelle Targaryen who married Ormund Baratheon. That was the basis of Robert's claim to kingship. His daughter Shireen is also alive in the books. (The Baratheons may also have more remote Targaryen ancestry, since it was rumoured that Orys Baratheon was the son of Aerion Targaryen, the Lord of Dragonstone and father of Aegon the Conqueror (and also of Aegon's wives, Visenya and Rhaneys).)</p>

<p>Robert's bastards also have the Baratheon's Targaryen ancestry. Known surviving bastards include Gendry, Edric Storm and Mya Stone.</p>

"73255","Why did Tyrion order Tommen to safety but not King Joffrey before the Riot at King's Landing occurs?","<p>In Season 2 episode 6 of <em>Game of Thrones</em>, when Tyrion notices that the small-folk are getting restless and feels that a riot is about to occur, he orders the Gold Cloaks to take Tommen to back to the Keep. However, he does not warn Joffrey about an impending riot, and then Joffrey gets a cow pie thrown in his face.</p>

<p>So my question is why would Tyrion order Tommen to safety, but not Joffrey when he suspected danger? Is it to ""teach"" Joffrey a lesson and to show him how the war is affecting the people?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","73259","<p>I'd say it was probably more a matter of choosing your battles/prioritizing the evacuation.  Tommen is young, sweet and able to be influenced.  Joff on the other hand is older, headstrong and cruel.  </p>

<p>If he had ordered Joff (along with everyone else) back to the red keep immediately he'd have likely hastened the coming of the riot without getting anyone to safety first for 2 basic reasons. </p>

<p>1) Joff as king is still expected to be performing some level of protocol.  Waving at the small folks, handing out food/coin to the poor ect.  Hurrying him back to the keep would alert crowds to something being wrong/there being weakness amongst the royal party and the mob may well have had the courage to act sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>2)  Joff would have fought Tyrion.  Joff would likely have refused to go back and would likely have showcased more of his cruelty sooner.  Thus onlookers might well have become even more outraged from the get go.</p>

<p>By sending Tommen back first Tyrion got the heir to the throne to safety before the outbreak of violence.</p>

<p>Ned also refuses to tell King Robert the name of Jon's mother and allows Jon to be a figure of hate for Catelyn so he is lying to his King and his wife to protect Jon but is there any other instance of Ned lying, black or white lie, about something not relating to Jon or his true identity?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","213228","<p>Ned only really lies about Jon's true parentage but he doesn't necessarily lie when he doesn't lie by refusing to tell Robert of his mother or letting Catelyn believe what she does.

<p>I count at least a few lies here from Ned's point of view.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em><strong>&quot;I come before you to confess my treason in the sight of Gods and men.&quot;</strong></em> He doesn't believe he is being treasonous in his actions but rather following the rightful procedures for who should be king.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em><strong>&quot;I betrayed the faith of my King and the trust of my friend Robert.&quot;</strong></em> If the King he is referring to here is Joffrey he doesn't believe him to be King so that's a lie. He also betrays Robert's trust but he believes he's acting in his interest so that could be a lie or not depending on how you look at it.</p>
</li>
<li><p><em><strong>&quot;I swore to protect and defend his children, but before his blood was cold I plotted to murder his son and seize the Throne for myself.&quot;</strong></em> He knows Joffrey isn't Robert's son and he wasn't seizing the Throne for himself.</p>

"213229","Have the Westerosi customs surrounding bells changed from Season 2 to Season 8?","<p>In S08E05 we learn from Tyrion that apparently Bells mean surrender of a city as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If the city surrenders, they will ring the bells</strong> and raise the gates.
Please, if you hear them ringing the bells, call off the attack.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But in S02E09, we saw:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Baratheon Fleet Approaches King's Landing]</p>
<p>[Bells Toll in King's landing when Stannis' Armies are sighted]</p>
<p>Stannis' Man: They're welcoming the new king.</p>
<p>Davos: <strong>I've never known bells to mean surrender</strong>. They want to play music with us? Let's play.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it Tyrion who is wrong? Or Davos who got it wrong? On one hand we have a noble who would be educated on customs of surrendering. On the other we have a fighting man and commander of a ship who apparently doesn't know that bells are supposed to mean surrender. Tyrion's addendum about raising the gates doesn't necessarily mean anything because gates can be raised for a surprise attack as well.</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","213231","<p>No, everything remains the same, in fact in the Battle of Blackwater the bells appear to be ringing to announce the coming attack.</p>
<blockquote>

<p><strong>Tyrion:</strong> A wedding.</p>
<p><sub><em>Game of Thrones</em>, Season 2 Episode 9, &quot;Blackwater&quot;</sub></p>

<p>And of course, as you quoted, Davos probably believes they mean the same thing, the city is warning the people they are under attack.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Davos:</strong> I've never known bells to mean surrender. They want to play music with us? Let's play. Drums.</p>
<p><sub><em>Game of Thrones</em>, Season 2 Episode 9, &quot;Blackwater&quot;</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Matthos believes they are surrendering which does note that it might be a common usage of them too. The function of the bells appears to be for many things so is probably quite confusing.</p>
<p>Lastly, we know Tyrion asks Jaime to tell the Lannisters to ring the bells if they surrender.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tyrion:</strong> If it works, give the order to ring all the bells in King's Landing and open the gates. That will be our signal that the city has surrendered.</p>
<p><strong>Jaime:</strong> I'll try.</p>
<p><strong>Tyrion:</strong> I never thought I'd get to repay the favor. Remember, ring the bells and open the gates.</p>
<p><sub><em>Game of Thrones</em>, Season 8 Episode 5, &quot;The Bells&quot;</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's likely that Jaime did tell someone when he got into the city as he was trying to draw Lannister attention at the entrance to the Red Keep by waving his golden hand. Lastly, the soldiers themselves believe the bells will ring when they have surrendered so it might have been a case just for this attack or only if bells ring during an attack that the city has surrendered.</p>

"213235","Where is the logic in castrating fighters?","<p>This came up on another question, where in <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> (the books <em>Game of Thrones</em> is based on), the Unsullied have all of their genitalia removed, not just the penis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In Yunkai and Meereen, eunuchs are often made by removing a boy's testicles, but leaving the penis. Such a creature is infertile, yet often still capable of erection. Only trouble can come of this. We remove the penis as well, leaving nothing. The Unsullied are the purest creatures on the earth.&quot; He gave Dany and Arstan another of his broad white smiles. &quot;I have heard that in the Sunset Kingdoms men take solemn vows to keep chaste and father no children, but live only for their duty. Is it not so?&quot;</p>
<p><sub>-- <em>A Storm of Swords</em>, chapter Daenerys II</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Removal of the penis makes sense in such a context, both to force obedience and to degrade the soldiers, but if you castrate a man then he loses most/all(?) of his ability to produce testosterone. Testosterone, being desirable for a soldier that relies on strength and fighting prowess, would be foolish to get rid of.</p>
<p>So for a (supposedly) elite army, why would it make sense to do so?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","213237","<p>The Unsullied are an analog of the Roman Legion.</p>

<p>Fully castrating the unsullied removed a major distraction, their upbringing/training forged them into perfect Legionnaires. They ignore wounds, hold the shield wall, and slowly and carefully wear down their attackers. They were made almost into automata, no humanity, no distractions.

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> But Drogo dies from the infection anyways. Seeing how she felt towards the Dothraki for destroying her sacred temple and raping her, did she deliberately mistreat the infection so Drogo would die?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What do the books say about this?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","15773","<p>I was thinking about this question when my daughter woke up at 3:30 this morning and I was trying to get her back to sleep.  So I've been doing some digging around.  I don't think that Mirri Maz Duur intentionally mistreated Drogo in an attempt to kill him.  </p>

<p>If you re-read the section where she initially treats him, she boils wine and pours it over the wound.  We have seen other maesters do the same thing in treating wounds (Pycelle does this when he attempts to treat Robert Baratheon's boar wound).  Additionally, we know that alcohol and heat both have antiseptic properties.  She stitches his wound closed with a silk thread.  She covers it with lambskin which doesn't personally seem the cleanest method of covering a wound to me, but it serves the same purpose as cotton (which I'm sure they didn't have), and some cultures have been known to use peat as an equivalent to cotton for wound dressings (which actually works better than cotton because it can absorb more than cotton, but it's not as pretty).  Then she instructs Drogo to avoid milk of the poppy (which I can only assume to be opium or an opium-like substance if we assume that plants in that world are roughly the same as plants in this world), and alcohol.  I don't exactly get why he should avoid a pain-killer, but <a href=""http://jdr.sagepub.com/content/89/3/219.abstract"">research</a> shows that alcohol consumption slows wound healing and increases the likelihood of infection (reasonable since we know that alcohol is a bloodthinner). So everything she has done and said up to this point indicate that she is truly trying to heal him.</p>

<p>This leaves only the question of the poultice that she put on him.  After he falls from his horse, she informs Dany that the poultice was made of firepod and sting-me-not.  I haven't run across any plants that are actually called this, so this is completely conjecture.  The poultice <em>could</em> have been the cause of Drogo's problems, but I'm guessing that a firepod is a chile pepper of some kind (and it would makes sense to call it ""firepod"" if it happens to be a red or orange pepper).  Capsaicin has antiseptic properties and would probably burn like hell if applied to a wound.  Sting-me-not sounds like a plant in the <em>Urtica</em> genus (stinging nettles and related) which also have antiseptic properties.</p>

<p>So...really, it seems like Drogo's death is caused by Drogo.  He removes the poultice and lambskin six days before he falls from his horse because he says it burns, and has it replaced with the soothing mud poultice placed there by the herbwomen--not by Mirri Maz Duur.  I don't know about you, but putting mud on a partially open wound is just nasty.  Mud is full of bacteria and other microorganisms.  It is not going to help the healing process.  He was also drinking fermented mare's milk (alcohol!) and had been taking milk of the poppy.  This probably dulled his senses and made him unaware of his declining health until it got to the point where he was too sick to know or care. Basically everything MMD said NOT to do, he did.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Alleras specifically says ""of noble birth"". To me this would imply that novices are accepted from any descent, noble or common. </p>

<hr>

<p>Even the founding of the Citadel is a bit of a mystery to modern Maesters. From <em>The World of Ice &amp; Fire</em> we find this excerpt in the ""Oldtown"" chapter.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The origins of the Citadel are almost as mysterious as those of the Hightower itself. Most credit its founding to the second son of Uthor of the High Tower, Prince Peremore the Twisted. A sickly boy, born with a withered arm and twisted back, Peremore was bedridden for much of his short life but had an insatiable curiosity about the world beyond his window, <strong>so he turned to wise men, teachers, priests, healers, and singers, along with a certain number of wizards, alchemists, and sorcerers.</strong> It is said the prince had no greater pleasure in life than listening to these scholars argue with one another. When Peremore died, his brother <strong>King Urrigon bequeathed a large tract of land beside the Honeywine to ""Peremore's pets,"" that they might establish themselves and continue teaching, learning, and questing after truth. And so they did.</strong> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems what were the original Maester, even though not that by name yet, were from all walks of life and from all different places. Which seems to be confirmed a few paragraphs later:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thousands of years before the first sept opened its doors, the city had been home to the Citadel, <strong>where boys and young men from all over Westeros came to study, learn, and forge their chains as maesters.</strong> No greater seat of knowledge exists anywhere in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While this does not explicting state whether the recruits are noble or common, I believe there is enough context to sumize that they were from both common and noble houses. </p>

<p>This also implies that the Citadel may not have had to do much ""recruiting"". It seems the Citadel was famous and respected enough that students would willingly seek out and come to join the order.</p>

<p>The child smiled. &quot;Men, they are the children.&quot;<br><sub><strong>ADWD - BRAN II</strong></sub></p>

<p>Since she says she was born when Dragons ruled and has lived at least for 2 centuries, that will make her date of birth in King Jaehaerys I's reign. And needless to say, now we know at least some of them can live upto 2 centuries and perhaps more given how healthy and young Leaf looked at that time. Or we can simply say that their lifespans are much longer than ours and leave it at that.</p>
<p>As for reproduction, yes they certainly can albeit at a slower rate than humans. They don't just simply pop out of the ground. In the Dawn Age, there lived only the elder races in Westeros which were the Children and the Giants. Eventually, the First Men started pouring in from the land-bridge that connected Westeros to Essos. And with that migration, came the wars between the children and the First men. With the tide turning against them, the children turned to desperate weapons and used magic to smash the land bridge connecting the two continents, called the Arm of Dorne. But it was too little and too late since Thousands of First Men were already in Westeros and more importantly, Wives of the First Men bore children more faster than the females of the Elder races which skewed the balance further in favour of men until the children were forced to realise that they could not win this war.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of what we do believe of the Breaking comes to us through song and legend. The First Men crossed from Essos to Westeros by land, all agree, walking or riding across through the hills and forest of the great land bridge that connected the two continents in the Dawn Age. Dorne was the first land that they entered, but few remained, as we have chronicled; many and more pressed on northward, through the mountains and mayhaps across the salt marshes that once existed where the Sea of Dorne is now. As the centuries passed, they came in everincreasing numbers, claiming the stormlands and the Reach and the riverlands for their own, eventually reaching even the Vale and the North. They drove the elder races before them, slaughtering giants wherever they found them, hewing down weirwood trees with their bronze axes, making bloody war against the children of the forest.</p>
<p>The children fought back as best they could, but the First Men were larger and stronger. Riding their horses, clad and armed in bronze, the First Men overwhelmed the elder race wherever they met, for the weapons of the children were made of bone and wood and dragonglass. Finally, driven by desperation, the little people turned to sorcery and beseeched their greenseers to stem the tide of these invaders.</p>
<p>[.....]</p>
<p>Most scholars do agree that Essos and Westeros were once joined; a thousand tales and runic records tell of the crossing of the First Men. Today the seas divide them, so plainly some version of the event the Dornish call the Breaking must have occurred. Did it happen in the space of a single day, however, as the songs would have it? Was it the work of the children of the forest and the sorcery of their greenseers? These things are less certain.</p>
<p>[....]</p>
<p>No more wanderers crossed to Westeros after the Breaking, it is true, for the First Men were no seafarers...but so many of their forebears had already made the crossing that they outnumbered the dwindling elder races almost three to one by the time the lands were severed, and that disparity only grew in the centuries that followed, <strong>for the women of the First Men brought forth sons and daughters with much greater frequency than the females of the elder races. And thus the children and the giants faded, whilst the race of men spread and multiplied</strong> and claimed the fields and forests for their own, raising villages and forts and kingdoms. <br><sub><strong>TWOIAF - Dorne: The Breaking</strong></sub></p>

<li><p>He tells Cersei he knows the truth about her children and that he is going to tell the king about it.</p></li>
<li><p>He doesn't suspect anything when Ser Hugh is killed by the Mountain in the tournament.</p></li>

<li><p>He trusts Littlefinger, a man who he knows is still in love with his wife. Littlefinger himself warns Ned not to trust him.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Is he portrayed as being just as naive in the books, or was he worse in the TV series?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","7633","<p>Ned Stark was, as we can see, and as he himself says, not at all comfortable or accustomed to the intrigues of court life. He was raised in a position of power, and he operated in a position of power at King's Landing. I think he grossly overestimated that power, even though it boggles the mind that someone can be that naive. As a lord, I imagine he felt that people should respect him because of who he was, not because they had to.</p>

<p>His real mistake was not securing absolute military power. That was one of the first things we saw Tyrion do when he was Hand: Remove the old leader of the gold cloaks Janos Slynt and put his own man in his place. Ned did go to King's Landing with a force of Winterfell men, but he sent some away with Beric Dondarrion, and the remainder of his men were ambushed and killed, apparently because they were not exactly expecting trouble.</p>

<p>I believe that Littlefinger was somewhat honest about helping Ned, but he really had no choice, since putting Stannis on the throne would effectively have ended Littlefinger's career. Something else that Ned probably should have known.</p>

<p>Ned made a lot of hard choices, that were correct from an honourable point of view. But the real irony is that what brought him down was stepping out of that character and doing something not <em>quite</em> moral. If you recall the passage when Ned asks Littlefinger to secure the aid of the gold cloaks, you will notice that Ned finds this hard to ask, because bribing men to capture his best friends children and wife is not honourable, in his mind.</p>

"145853","Why did Robert and Rhaegar fight at the Trident instead of down south in the Stormlands?","<p>Since the first book, it's said that Robert Baratheon defeated Rhaegar Targaryen at the Trident.</p>

<p>I can't figure the timeline from when Rhaegar was hiding in Dorne with Lyanna, then went to the Riverlands to confront Rebels headed by Robert Baratheon.</p>

<p>As Robert is from the Stormlands, I would expect them to have met and fought in the South.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><warfare><geography>","145854","<p>That's because Robert's allies were up north and he did not want to get surrounded by Armies of Crownlands, Highgarden and Dorne.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Geography of Westeros</h3>
<p>In Westeros there are nine administrative units which can be seen here:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yTImQ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/yTImQ.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see, Stormlands are surrounded:</p>
<ol>
<li>In North, there are Royal fiefs of Crownlands.</li>
<li>In East there is the Narrow Sea.</li>
<li>In West, There is the Reach.</li>
<li>In South, There is Dorne.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3>Robert's Dilemma</h3>
<p>When the War broke out, Following was the Breakdown of the forces:</p>
<p><strong>The Rebels:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>the North</li>
<li>the Vale</li>
<li>the Riverlands</li>
<li>the Stormlands</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The Loyalists:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>The Crownlands</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Reach</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dorne</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, All of Robert's allies were up North. North, Vale and Riverlands shared borders with each other with only Riverlands sharing borders with Loyalist territories.</p>
<p>Stormlands alone were however surrounded by the Loyalists on every compass point. So Robert wanted to advance his forces north and link up with his allies before he could be trapped between the loyalist forces of Dorne, Reach and Crownlands. But he had to first deal with Storm Lords who were trying to rise up for the King.</p>
<p>Robert had won <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battles_at_Summerhall"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">victories at Summerhall</a> against those Lords and now had the complete support of Stormlands behind him. With home front secured, Robert advanced North-Westwards to link up with his allies; The Houses Tully, Arryn and Stark.</p>
<p>Naturally, to reach Riverlands, Robert had to either cross the Crownlands or the Reach. Robert chose to cross through the Reach and came upon the border town of Ashford. It is unclear if Robert tried to take Ashford castle before advancing to Riverlands but we know he was soon faced by Tyrells. Lord Mace had bestirred himself and Lord Randyll Tarly, known as finest soldier in the realm, had reached Ashford with his vanguard.</p>
<p>Tarly did not wait for main Tyrell Army to arrive and <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_Ashford"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">charged at the Stormlanders</a>. Stormlanders suffered losses and on arrival of main Tyrell Army, Robert was forced to withdraw to Riverlands. This is the only defeat Robert ever suffered.</p>
<p>That's how Robert reached Riverlands and the reason why further confrontations happened in that region as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Riverlands were the only point of entry into Rebel territory</li>
<li>Rebel leaders, the Lords Arryn, Stark, Tully and Baratheon were present in Riverlands.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h3>How did Rhaegar reach Riverlands from Dorne?</h3>
<p>Rhaegar had gone to Dorne, that's correct.</p>
<p>However, the Loyalists suffered a very heavy defeat in <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_the_Bells"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Battle of the Bells</a>. That's when Rhaegar returned from Dorne and took command of the remnants of the Royal Armies, regrouped and reinforced.</p>
<p>From <em>ASOS: Jaime V</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He floated in heat, in memory. &quot;<strong>After dancing griffins lost the
Battle of the Bells</strong>, Aerys exiled him.&quot; Why am I telling this absurd
ugly child? &quot;He had finally realized that Robert was no mere outlaw
lord to be crushed at whim, but the greatest threat House Targaryen
had faced since Daemon Blackfyre. The king reminded Lewyn Martell
gracelessly that he held Elia and sent him to take <strong>command of the
ten thousand Dornishmen coming up the kingsroad</strong>. <strong>Jon Darry and
Barristan Selmy rode to Stoney Sept to rally what they could of
griffins' men</strong>, and <strong>Prince Rhaegar returned from the south</strong> and
persuaded his father to swallow his pride and summon my father.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then marched towards North and tried to cross the River trident.</p>
<p>Rebels decided to stop the advance of the Prince at River Trident because given the terrain of Riverlands (All plains and rivers) that was the nearest defensible position against the Advancing Royal Armies. A battle ensued which decided the fate of Targaryen monarchy and the Crown Prince was killed.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Lyanna getting kidnapped and dying 9 months later...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...and the sudden appearance of Jon Snow. Why does no one suspect the obvious? </p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><jon-snow>","73772","<p>""Suspect"" is a strong word. We do not know what anyone, except the POV characters, suspect. We can only suspect, or assume that they suspect, unless they voice their suspicions. People might very well suspect things about Ned's bastard son. But the story of his breach of honour in bringing a bastard child home from the war was no doubt an appealing story for people: Why would he say such a thing unless it was true?</p>

<p>We know that he sacrificed his own honour to protect Lyannna's son. Much like Robb chose to sacrifice his own honour to protect the honour of the woman he married, Jeyne Westerling. But to the common man, it would be a plausible story that an honourable man brings home his bastard and raises him with his trueborn children. </p>

<p>However, GRRM's official ""cover story"", as I have always understood it, is what Littlefinger says to Sansa: <em>It is rude to pry into people's bastards.</em> It is described in this conversation between him and Sansa, when they decide on the best cover story for Sansa when she comes to the Eyrie.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(Sansa) ""Couldn't I be the trueborn daughter of some knight in your service?
  Perhaps he died gallantly in the battle, and...""</p>
  
  <p>(Littlefinger) ""I have no gallant knights in my service, Alayne. Such a tale would
  draw unwanted questions as a corpse draws crows. It is rude to pry
  into the origins of a man's natural children, however.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for why no one would 1) wonder <em>how</em> Lyanna died, 2) connect it with Ned bringing home an infant son, which seems a pretty obvious connection to make, from our perspective, one has to take into account that this was war. Momentous events took place, the Targaryen dynasty fell, many great lords died or were exiled, many knights were killed, many ""war babies"" were no doubt born. Not all people are as inquisitive as someone like, for example, Littlefinger or Lord Varys.</p>

<p>And also, of course, it fits the story much better this way. :)</p>

<p>The episode <a href=""https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Fire_and_Blood"" rel=""noreferrer"">&quot;Fire and Blood&quot;</a> has a scene with <em>nine</em> Kingsguard, but it's known there are only seven (six in the city) at this point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During the scene in which Joffrey torments Marillion the minstrel in the throne room, too many Kingsguard members are present. There should be only six in the capital, given that Jaime Lannister left King's Landing to fight in the Riverlands (also, Sandor Clegane has replaced Ser Barristan Selmy). Five can be seen immediately next to the Iron Throne (including Sandor and Ser Meryn), but paradoxically, when the camera switches to Marillion and the rest of the crowd, four Kingsguard members can be seen guarding the main entrance to the throneroom - for a total of nine Kingsguard, when there are never more than seven at a time, and only six should be present now. There probably weren't nine actors in Kingsguard outfits when the scene was filmed, as all nine are never in the camera frame at the same time. More likely, different takes of the same scene positioned the Kingsguard members differently, then mismatched the shots in the editing process.</p>

The King and his brother refused to give Lady Larra up and closed the gates of Maegor's Holdfast. Though Marston did lay a secret siege to Maegor's Holdfast while his King and the royal family suffered inside without food or water for 18 days, he refused to order his men to attack the King he had sworn to protect, he instead chose to beg the King to open the doors and to reason with him.

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","213917","<h3>Almost certainly not and I can find no cases of it ever happening</h3>
<p>There are no recorded cases that I can find of a Night's Watch brother being released from their oaths and joining the Kingsguard. In fact I can't really think of a case of a sworn brother being released from their oath. We have Jon Snow but he pulled the whole loophole trick in the show and we're yet to see what happens in the books so we can discount that. However, Stannis does offer to legitimise him and free him from the oath, though it is not clear if he actually <em>can</em> do that or is doing it because he has the army and power to enforce it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;As you wish. But consider quickly. I am not a patient man, as your black brothers are about to discover.&quot; Stannis put a thin, fleshless hand on Jon's shoulder. &quot;Say nothing of what we've discussed here today. To anyone. But when you return, you need only bend your knee, lay your sword at my feet, and pledge yourself to my service, and you shall rise again as Jon Stark, the Lord of Winterfell.&quot;</p>
<p><sub><em>A Storm of Swords</em>, Jon XI</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only known case of someone else being released from the oath is Samwell Tarly at the end of Season 8 but it happens off screen. We can assume the new King released him so it would appear that kings <em>can</em> do this but usually don't as the men of the Watch are usually less than stellar. Sam is also made Archmaester so this <em>might</em> have something to do with it as well.</p>
<p>The oath explicitly states <em>&quot;I shall live and die at my post.&quot;</em> and so would make it clear that one cannot simply leave, as we see deserters are executed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact the Kingsguard oath was modelled on the Night's Watch one and so it would appear whilst they have common elements they probably conflict as Kingsguard members serve for life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was Visenya, not Aegon, who decided the nature of the Kingsguard. Seven champions for the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, who would all be knights. She modeled their vows upon those of the Night's Watch, so that they would forfeit all things save their duty to the king.</p>
<p><sub><em>The World of Ice and Fire</em>, The Targaryen Kings: Aegon I</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lastly, it is worth noting of those Kingsguard that were sent to the Night's Watch most had lost their king and broke the oath by betraying said king. And the odd one out broke the oath by fathering children. Breaking the Night's Watch oath results in death not being released from it to join a more prestigious organisation.</p>

"74244","Is Cersei's Penance Walk partly inspired by the short story the Emperor's New Clothes?","<p>While I heard that Cersei's penance walk is loosely inspired by the penance walk of Jane Shore (which is a real event), the first thing that came to mind regarding the penance walk is the story from Hans Christian Andersen's short story that shows the emperor showing off his new ""clothes"" to the people when he is actually naked. </p>

<p>Is it more of a coincidence that Cersei's penance walk is similar to the emperor's walk in the short story?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","74281","<p>Public penance was fairly common in Medieval Europe. As it says <a href=""http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/dictionary/index.cfm?id=35905"">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The practice of requiring penitents to give public satisfaction for
  their sins as a condition for absolution and reconciliation with the
  Church. In vogue up to the early Middle Ages, public penance could be
  either solemn or not, depending on the gravity of the offense and the
  amount of scandal given.</p>
  
  <p>When public penance was also solemn, the reason had to be a grave one.
  Among the public crimes that might be subject to solemn penance, the
  most common were adultery, apostasy, fornication, and murder,
  including abortion. A historic example of public penance was Henry
  II's walking barefoot in 1174 to the shrine of St. Thomas of Bucket,
  to expiate his part in the murder of the archbishop. The more common
  practice was to limit solemn penance to those crimes that gave such
  scandal as seemed to call for proportionate expiation.</p>
  
  <p>More generally, public penance was not solemn. The person would
  secretly confess some grave sin from which he was absolved by a
  priest. His satisfaction would be an external penance from which
  others might conclude the nature of the sin, but there was no formal
  identification as a public sinner.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This real historical practice was almost certainly the inspiration for Cersei Lannister's ""Walk of Shame"". Since the point of the ""Emperor's New Clothes"" story was more about ""Speaking Truth to Power"", I doubt it has any connection here. I can kinda see what the OP is asking about though; certainly the ""Emperor"" ended up being publicly shamed, although that wasn't the moral of the story. There's also Lady Godiva's ride, but that was about her purposely shaming her husband into doing something (reducing taxes, IIRC). But neither of these really fits Cersei's <em>officially mandated punishment</em>.</p>

<p>In the books as far as I can tell Loras does not have a birthmark, in fact he reportedly dies before he would even have a trial or the Faith Militant has properly seized control (if they do in the books).</p>

"75571","Did Stannis see himself or another King in the night fire?","<p>In <em>A Storm of Swords</em> Stannis says this to Davos:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I know the cost! Last night, gazing into that hearth, I saw things in the flames as well. I saw a king, a crown of fire on his brows, burning... burning, Davos. His own crown consumed his flesh and turned him into ash. Do you think I need Melisandre to tell me what that means? Or you?”<br /><sup><em>-A Song of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Davos.</em></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He seems to imply that he thinks it is him who will burn because of his own crown. Stannis the Mannis has always taken his responsibility strongly [gritting intensifies], and clearly believes that he must see it through to the end, no matter what it costs himself. 
But we've already seen this exact scene happen with <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Viserys_Targaryen"">Viserys III</a>.</p>

<p>So, <strong>does Stannis see himself in the flames or Viserys?</strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","131396","<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Since it is not possible to give a concrete answer to this as we do not know how this prophecy will unfold yet, this is only my own inference based on canon references. </p>

<p>It cannot be Viserys because he had already died in AGOT. We did not know about this vision until ASOS as you mention. And Stannis saw it a long time after Viserys had died. As far as I recall, Fire does not let you see the past like Greenseers can (Joff's death is kinda complex. I can't recall if Mel saw his death in future or in present at nightfire). </p>

<p>It is unlikely that he was misled into reading the fire that way by Melisandre because Stannis saw this on his own. Besides, Viserys did not turn to ashes. He did not even had a finger set on fire. Only his silken clothes burnt. </p>

<p>From AGOT:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sound Viserys Targaryen made when that hideous iron helmet covered
  his face was like nothing human. His feet hammered a frantic beat
  against the dirt floor, slowed, stopped. Thick globs of molten gold
  dripped down onto his chest, <strong>setting the scarlet silk to
  smoldering</strong>... yet no drop of blood was spilled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also by the time of ACOK, Iron Throne knew Viserys Targaryen had died. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Sit,"" Joff commanded, gesturing her to the empty seat beside his own.
  ""<strong>Have you heard? The Beggar King is dead.</strong>"" </p>
  
  <p>""Who?"" For a moment Sansa was afraid he meant Robb. </p>
  
  <p>""Viserys. The last son of Mad King Aerys. He's been going about the
  Free Cities since before I was born, calling himself a king. Well,
  Mother says the Dothraki finally crowned him. With molten gold.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can assume that word must have passed at least in the nobles so in all probability, Stannis knew about it as well. So he might have also thought that he was looking at fate of Viserys unless he was convinced that he wasn't. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, by ADWD, it was a common knowledge even in lands as far as White Harbor in North. If they knew, we can assume that Dragonstone must have known before them seeing as Dragonstone is the closest Westerosi land in vicinity of Essos. From Davos Chapter 15, ADWD:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You're bloody mad"", said an oarsman off Storm Dancer. ""<strong>The begger</strong>
  <strong>King's been dead for years</strong>. Some Dothraki horselord cut his head off.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nightfire only shows you present, future and possible future. It does not show you the past so I could not have been recap of Viserys' death. As Stannis said to Mel in ASOS:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In the nightfire.” Stannis and Melisandre came through the door
  together. “The flames are full of tricks. <strong>What is, what will be,
  what may be</strong>. You cannot tell me for a certainty...”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The crown Stannis wears is described as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A crown of red gold wrought with <strong>points that look like flames</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe he saw himself in the vision and it shows that his quest to gain the throne will ultimately be failed, no matter before gaining the throne or afterwards, because his own acts and powers will destroy him. The quest is already taking a toll on him as Mel noted that she could not make another shadow baby with Stannis because his <em>Fire were burning too low &amp; it might kill him</em>. He has started looking gaunt and weak with everyday passing. Anyhow, I believe it predicts his own death. </p>

<p>He is Robert's heir and thus a King. But it is quite possible that Stannis just saw some other unknown King. He never said that the King was himself. Nevertheless, It was not Viserys. But It could be Stannis. </p>

Is there some minimum time that Bran's vision works at?  Could he see what happened a few seconds ago?</p>

<p>Specifically I'm thinking about the end of the Battle of Winterfell.  If Bran can see the very recent past as well, why didn't he tell Theon that Arya was coming?  Why let Theon throw his life away?</p>

<p>I know this scene hasn't happened yet in the books, but I am interested in any information they may have on the subject as well.</p>

<p>It appears from Lord Brynden's instructions, that there is no real limit on what the greenseers can and cannot see:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Will I see my father again?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Once you have mastered your gifts, you may look where you will and see what the trees have seen, be it yesterday or last year or a thousand ages past.</strong> Men live their lives trapped in an eternal present, between the mists of memory and the sea of shadow that is all we know of the days to come. Certain moths live their whole lives in a day, yet to them that little span of time must seem as long as years and decades do to us. An oak may live three hundred years, a redwood tree three thousand. A weirwood will live forever if left undisturbed. To them seasons pass in the flutter of a moth's wing, and past, present, and future are one. Nor will your sight be limited to your godswood. The singers carved eyes into their heart trees to awaken them, and those are the first eyes a new greenseer learns to use … but in time you will see well beyond the trees themselves.&quot;<br />
<sub>A Dance with Dragons, Bran III, emphasis mine.</sub></p>

<p>However, as is mentioned, the sight is limited so what the (Weirwood) trees have seen. Whether Arya was visible from the hearttree in the godswood is not certain.</p>
<h1>Show: uncertain</h1>
<p>In the show, Bran's visions are not limited to what Weirwoods were able to see. After all, he knows of things where no Weirwood was present, like the events at the Tower of Joy, Sansa's wedding night, Littlefinger's speech.</p>
<p>And despite all that, his powers didn't show anything useful in Season 8, so it's hard to make statements on what exactly he can and cannot do in the show's canon.</p>

"147562","Hasn't the Waif followed the blind training?","<p>In the episode S06E08, <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/No_One"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>No One</em></a>, Arya defeats The Waif by taking advantage on her in fighting in the dark. But it seemed that The Waif were a more advanced acolyte than Arya was, so The Waif should have mastered the blind training too.</p>

<p>Arya disobedience induced here to follow the blind training sooner than planned, but blind training is part of the Faceless Men graduation anyway. So why isn't The Waif stronger than Arya in a blind fight?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","147647","<p>Arya continued the blind training until she could hold her own against the (sighted) Waif while blind - they're now well matched when Arya is handicapped and the waif isn't. So:</p>

<ul>
<li>Blind Arya can beat sighted Waif. With Waif using sight and Arya using only other senses, it's a close fight Arya can win.</li>
<li>Blind Arya has lots of experience fighting the Waif. She is finely attuned to the sounds and patterns of the Waif's movements</li>
<li>The Waif has (presumably) also been trained to fight while blind, but <strong>has always fought Arya while sighted</strong>. She knows all the <em>visual</em> cues for Arya's particular moves - but they're useless here.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, Arya's extensive experience of the Waif's fighting style is 100% useful here, but the Waif's specific experience of Arya's moves is much less useful in this fight. </p>

<p>Arya's fighting a familiar fight she's fought countless times, while the Waif is blind-fighting <em>against Arya</em> for the first (and last) time.</p>

<hr>

<p>Arya's also using a weapon (Needle) she's got heaps of experience with, but which the Waif has never faced from Arya. This is a big deal not just because it'll be a different experience, but also because Arya is left handed (<a href=""https://winteriscoming.net/2011/04/05/interview-with-maisie-williams/"" rel=""noreferrer"">fun fact: actress Maisie Williams is right-handed but taught herself left-handed swordplay for this role</a>) and the Waif has mostly fought Arya while she was using a two handed weapon. </p>

<p>In real-life fencing, left-handers are tricky to defend against because attacks are coming from less familiar angles. This must be harder still if unable to see.</p>

<hr>

<p>So, things that give Arya an advantage:</p>

<ul>
<li>Her blind-fighting skills are fresh and sharp</li>
<li>She's mastered anticipating the Waif's moves without sight</li>
<li>She's using her favorite weapon (Needle)</li>
<li>She's very familiar with this particular enclosed room, and can use the walls and furniture to her advantage</li>
</ul>

<p>Things that may give the Waif a disadvantage:</p>

<ul>
<li>We don't know how recently she's used her blind fighting skills. Presumably she can do it well, but she's likely to have less recent experience and might be rusty</li>
<li>All her experience fighting Arya was while sighted</li>
<li>We don't know how recently she fought an opponent who was using Bravo-style swordplay. Presumably (living in Braavos) she's familiar with it, but she might be rusty</li>
<li>She's in an enclosed space she doesn't know and can't see, which is likely to make her even more vulnerable</li>
<li>All her experience fighting Arya was with a two-handed weapon. She's never seen the unique blend of Syrio-inspired water dancing, Hound-inspired brutal pragmatism and Waif-inspired minimalism <a href=""https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3kUTRLFi0V0"" rel=""noreferrer"">that later on (beware small season 7 spoilers) we see</a> that Arya had developed. </li>
</ul>

<p>This reminds me of what Ned said to Jaime about why he never fights in tournaments (from <a href=""http://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewtopic.php?f=67&amp;t=7743"" rel=""noreferrer"">this transcript</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...because when I fight a man for real, I don’t want him to know what I can do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The waif is unarmoured, unprepared for this type of fight, on unfamiliar ground against an agile left-handed opponent she underestimated, who has a <strike> big</strike> sharp f*****g sword and remembers where the heart is.  </p>

<hr>

<p>Of course, as noted in a comment, Arya also has a massive fresh stomach wound that is probably infected from the stagnant, sewage-ridden city canal water she then swam in, plus the deadly fast-acting poison that the waif has unlimited access to and would surely have coated her dagger in as a matter of habit. </p>

"147803","Was Bran's accident a precondition for his recruitment?","<p>I wonder if Bran would have had the same fate without having his accident.</p>

<p>Bran started to dream about the Three-eyed Crow whilst he was in a coma. It appeared then that</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> the old Three-eyed Crow is recruiting his own successor and he chose Bran.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't know if the former Three-eyed Crow, Brynden, was himself injured and how he was recruited.</p>

<p>Do we know if being crippled is a condition to do the ""job""? Being in a coma, was it a condition to be reached, through the dreams?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","147804","<p>Nobody knows the answer to this question yet. But as GRRM says, everything shall be explained in due time. So this will be mere speculation based on canon evidence.</p>

<h3>Who is Three-eyed Crow?</h3>

<p>The Three-eyed Crow is beyond a doubt Brynden Rivers, son of King Aegon IV and known as Bloodraven. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The last greenseer, the singers called him, but in Bran's dreams he
  was still a three-eyed crow. When Meera Reed had asked him his true
  name, he made a ghastly sound that might have been a chuckle. ""I wore
  many names when I was quick, but even I once had a mother, <strong>and the
  name she gave me at her breast was Brynden.</strong>""<br><sub>ADWD-Bran
  III</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""But,"" said Bran, ""he heard me.""</p>
  
  <p>""He heard a whisper on the wind, a rustling amongst the leaves. You
  cannot speak to him, try as you might. I know. I have my own ghosts,
  Bran. <strong>A brother that I loved, a brother that I
  hated, a woman I desired.</strong> Through the trees,
  I see them still, but no word of mine has ever reached them. The past
  remains the past. We can learn from it, but we cannot change
  it.""<br><sub>ADWD-Bran III</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This fits because:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bloodraven loved either Daemon or Daeron II, both his half brothers. </li>
<li>Blooraven hated Aegor Rivers, his half brother. </li>
<li>Bloodraven was infatuated with his half sister, Shiera Seastar. She was one of the chief reasons of the rivalry between Bloodraven and Bittersteel. </li>
</ul>

<p>Also we have his physical appearence where Bran observes that he bears the birthmark Bloodraven had:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What skin the corpse lord showed was white, save for a bloody blotch that crept up his neck onto his cheek</strong>. His white hair was fine and
  thin as root hair and long enough to brush against the earthen floor.
  Roots coiled around his legs like wooden serpents<br><sub>ADWD-Bran
  II</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He also confessed that he was a brother of the Night's Watch in the same chapter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Are you the three-eyed crow?"" Bran heard himself say. A three-eyed
  crow should have three eyes. He has only one, and that one red. Bran
  could feel the eye staring at him, shining like a pool of blood in the
  torchlight. Where his other eye should have been, a thin white root
  grew from an empty socket, down his cheek, and into his neck.</p>
  
  <p><strong>""A … crow?""</strong> The pale lord's voice was dry. His lips moved slowly, as if they had forgotten how to form words. <strong>""Once, aye. Black of
  garb and black of blood.""</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Did Bloodraven himself had any near-fatal experiences?</h3>

<p>We know that Bloodraven must have faced two near-death events:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>He suffered a greivous injury to his head/face in duel against his half-brother Aegor Rivers aka Bittersteel. He lost his eye as a result but survived.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He stared so hard that Bloodraven felt it. The king's sorcerer had
  turned to study him as he went by. He had one eye, and that one red.
  <strong>The other was an empty socket, the gift Bittersteel had given him upon the Redgrass Field.</strong><br><sub>Dunk &amp; Egg: The Sworn Sword</sub></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>He was lost beyond the wall so it is possible that he may have faced a near-death experience out there due to exposure if nothing else. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bloodraven would rise to become Lord Commander of the Night's Watch in
  239 AC, serving until <strong>his disappearance during a ranging beyond the
  Wall</strong> in 252 AC.<br><sub>TWOIAF: Aegon V</sub></p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<h3>Did Jojen and Bran face any near-death experiences before being chosen?</h3>

<p>We have example of Jojen as well. Three-eyed Crow came to him when he was almost fatally ill. He came to Bran when he was also near-death. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Summer raised his head from Bran's lap, and gazed at the mudman with
  his dark golden eyes.</p>
  
  <p>""<strong>When I was little I almost died of greywater fever. That was when
  the crow came to me.</strong>""</p>
  
  <p><strong>""He came to me after I fell,"" Bran blurted</strong>. ""I was asleep for a long time. He said I had to fly or die, and I woke up, only I was
  broken and I couldn't fly after all.""<br><sub>ACOK-Bran IV</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>If we observe the pattern here, two things are common:</p>

<ol>
<li>All three were followers of the old Gods.</li>
<li>All three were in a life-threatening situation. </li>
</ol>

<p>So by that logic we can infer that yes Bran's accident was necessary for his recruitment.</p>

<p>According to the rules of the Kingdom, Eddard should have send Ilyn Payne, the King's Justice and Royal Executioner.

<blockquote>
  <p>In truth, <strong>Ned did not trust the mute knight, though perhaps that was only because he misliked executioners.</strong> ""I remind you, the <strong>Paynes are bannermen to House Lannister. I thought it best to choose men who owed Lord Tywin no fealty</strong>.""</p>

<p>Lord Beric was in King's Landing to participate in the Hand's Tourney and stayed a few days after, hence was attending at the court.</p>

"216163","Why didn't Aerys II or Rhaegar let the world know that Rhaegar married Lyanna?","<p>It was Rhaegar Targaryen's <em>'kidnapping'</em> of Lyanna Stark and then King Aerys II's murder of her brother Brandon and father Rickard (who went to see Aerys, asking for the justice) that caused Robert's rebellion and eventually, the end of the Targaryen dyansty.<br>
 All of these could have avoided if Rhaegar or Aerys II has announced that Rhaegar didn't kidnap her but married her.<br>
 The Starks would have probably be happy as Lyanna was happy with Rhaegar (it was hinted that Lyanna didn't fancy Robert Baratheon at all). Only Robert would have created a fuss but no other would have joined him to oppose the King. Instead they chose to stay silent, kill Brandon and Rickard and order Jon Arryn to kill his then stewards Robert and Ned.  </p>

<p>Calamities that <strong>could have been</strong> avoided if the 'announcement' path was taken by Rhaegar/Aerys II:   </p>

<p>1) Deaths of Brandon &amp; Rickard Stark<br>
2) Robert's Rebellion (which resulted in the following deaths)<br>
3) Death of Aerys II<br>
4) Death of Rhaegar<br>
5) Death of Lyanna (she died at childbirth, but she could have lived if she was given proper healthcare, rather than letting her to give birth in an isolated tower)<br>
6) Deaths of Sir Arthur Dayne,Sir Gerold Hightower, Sir Oswell Whent (his character was not depicted in the TV show's battle of Tower of Joy) from Kingsguard<br>
7) Deaths of Elia Martell, Prince Aegon &amp; Princess Rhaenys<br>
8) Deaths of countless people from both Targaryen forces &amp; Rebels </p>

<p>It is plausible to say that either Aerys II didn't know the real story about Rhaegar and Lyanna OR he was not thinking wisely, but Rhaegar was a very wise man and he could have done everything to stop needless bloodshed.<br>
My question is, is there any plausible reason for Rhaegar/Aerys II to act like the way they did? </p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","216167","<p>While R+L = J is pretty much confirmed, it still remains a theory as far as books are concerned in absence of any explicit confirmation from the author regarding Lyanna and Rhaegar's relation (Or lack thereof).</p>
<h3>The Timeline</h3>
<p>Here's what we know:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rhaegar outraged the whole realm by crowning the maiden daughter of Lord Rickard Stark, betrothed to Lord Robert Baratheon instead of his legal wife Princess Elia of Dorne. Polygamy is a no-no in faith of the Seven which the Royal family and most of the population adheres to. Only Aegon I's polygamy was tolerated by the faith, and when Maegor tried to follow his father he was exiled and declared a heretic, which eventually sparked the Faith's war against crown. And bear in mind, Aegon and Maegor had dragons.</li>
<li>Rhaegar openly &quot;abducted&quot; Lyanna while she was travelling with her family. King's guards apparently helped him.</li>
<li>Rhaegar goes off-grid and disappears following the kidnapping for reasons best known to him or his associates.</li>
<li>Aerys had no idea what had transpired. Even if someone told him his son had abducted the Stark girl, He'd not mind his son taking up a mistress or two, the King was no stranger to carnal pleasures. Hardly a moral man, Aerys.</li>
<li>Brandon rides to Red Keep and threatens to kill Prince Rhaegar.</li>
<li>For crime of threatening the Blood of the Dragon, Aerys arrests Brandon and his friends and calls for their fathers to present themselves and explain the actions of their sons.</li>
<li>Rickard goes to KL where Aerys burns him and kills Brandon and his friends (Except his squire). The seeds of the war are sown.</li>
<li>Still not satisfied, the mad King commands Lord Jon Arryn to kill his wards Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon.</li>
<li>Jon Arryn calls his banners and fighting begins in Gulltown.</li>
<li>Robert and Eddard make it to their domains.</li>
<li>Robert defeats his royalist vassals and marches his men to Riverlands.</li>
<li>Tyrells defeat Robert at Ashford.</li>
<li>Robert retreats into the Riverlands.</li>
<li>Lord Jon Conington, Hand of the King, surrounds the town Robert was hiding in and Battle of the Bells happens.</li>
<li>Robert is rescued by sudden arrival of Hoster Tully and Eddard Stark's men. Royal army is shattered and scattered to four winds. Rhaegar and Lyanna are still nowhere to be found.</li>
<li>Aerys exiles Lord Jon Conington, commands Prince Doran Martell to send forth his armies, dispatches Sers Barristan Selmy and Jonothor Darry to regroup the shattered remains of Ex-Hand's army, sends Lord Commander Gerold Hightower to find Prince Rhaegar.</li>
<li>Rhaegar finally returns after Ser Gerold finds him, rides to Ruby Ford and dies.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Relationship between Rhaegar and Aerys</h3>
<p>There is no indication that Rhaegar and Aerys had any conversation between the abduction and his return. Furthermore, <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/168653/what-kind-of-relationship-did-aerys-ii-and-rhaegar-targaryen-have?rq=1"">Aerys did not trust Rhaegar</a> and suspected that Rhaegar was trying to usurp his throne with aid of Lord Tywin Lannister. Rhaegar on the other hand was aware that his father was unhinged and he most likely was in league with Lord Tywin Lannister to become Prince Regent for his father, just as Aerys suspected. It is unlikely that he confided in Aerys.</p>
<h3>&quot;Rhaegar fought nobly, Rhaegar fought honourably....and Rhaegar was thick as a brick&quot;</h3>
<p>As to why couldn't he send a raven? Did he send a raven? No one knows. I'd not make too much of Rhaegar's wisdom though. Pure speculation, Rhaegar was an idiot when it came to Lyanna.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;All men are knights and all men are fools when it comes to women&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His actions show that he didn't even expect it to blow up that much. He might have expected that if he disappears until things cool down a bit, he might have a chance of explaining himself in front of all the parties concerned.</p>
<h3>Rhaegar's personality</h3>
<p>He possibly didn't even know that his little stunt had caused a civil war until it was too late. Rhaegar had always been dutiful after all, it's unlike him to knowingly shirk off his duty to his family and the realm. Pure Speculation, I don't think Rhaegar told anyone. He was secretive by nature and his only real friend was Ser Arthur Dayne.</p>
<h3>Why not go public?</h3>
<p>He knew he had acted foolishly but he also knew the cost of going public; Condemnation and excommunication from the Sept (doubly so if he tried to marry her), Wrath of Houses Martell, Stark and Baratheon. Martells would be dishonoured by him taking Lyanna as a concubine just as Starks would be. Baratheons would be angered since Lyanna was promised to Robert. And if Baratheons and Starks are angry, that means Tullys and Arryns are also angry. Rhaegar could not set aside Elia to appease the Starks or take Lyanna as a concubine/second wife/mistress because:</p>
<ol>
<li>It would cause Martells to rise up in Rebellion.</li>
<li>Faith doesn't allow a divorce or annulment if the marriage is consummated. High Septon would have been livid.</li>
<li>It would sow seeds of another Dance of the Dragons, this time between Rhaegar's children from Lyanna and his children from Elia.</li>
<li>Wrath of houses Stark, Baratheon, Tully and Arryn.</li>

<p>It is even more puzzling how people do not get totally freaked out by this. Sure they seem somewhat surprised by the ""oddity"" of somebody being revived, but certainly not enough to become true believers themselves.</p>

<p>Could it be because living in a world with dragons, zombies, warlocks, mind controllers, future seers etc. just diminishes one's ability to be amazed by things we would call supernatural?</p>

<p>But then why even worship gods like the Seven or the Drowned God, who don't even manifest any miracles on a regular basis, at all?</p>

<p>Am I missing something?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><religion>","149372","<p><strong>The religion seems to be <em>gaining</em> power, as the priests <em>gain</em> actual powers.</strong></p>
<p>This is an interesting question, and I suspect that it'll be explored more in future books and that it's deliberate that all we have right now are clues. But there's enough in those clues to tell us that the thing that makes Red Priests presently so impressive was, up until recently, nowhere near as strong as it is now:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Red priests seems surprised by their own power.</strong> Thoros was a jaded drunk who had virtually given up on the faith until, to his great surprise, he bought someone back to life. We see Melisandre openly admit to frequently relying on fakery, lies and parlour tricks in order to increase people's faith - and from how well stocked she is with potions and powders, it seems these parlour tricks are common for red priests. In the TV show but not (yet?) in the books:</p>
<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
<p> Melisandre didn't expect to be able to bring Jon back to life, but managed to.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Magic (particularly fire-related magic) is on the rise.</strong> Pyromancers are making wildfire faster than ever, the warlocks' magic abilities increased (seemingly dragon-related i.e. fire-related), and, in the books but not (yet?) the TV show:</p>
<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
<p> magical obsidian candles suddenly work again. These had not worked for so long, the maesters seemed to assume they <em>never</em> worked and were merely traditional learning props for teaching humility</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something is happening.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The red priests are rapidly gaining influence.</strong> The ones we meet in Volantis seem to be just one book away from bringing about some kind of revolution, from seemingly having been quite minor. Melisandre came from nothing to influence one of Westeros's more powerful lords. They seem to be spreading everywhere, while there's little to suggest that before recently they were much more than one sect among many from a far-flung corner of the far east. The powers in Essos don't seem to see them as a threat (yet!).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It's quite possible (and I suspect might be confirmed in the next book) that the Red Priests were until recently mostly all talk, parlour tricks, and predictions little better than guesses.</p>
<p>There are a few moments we seem them candidly, such as Thoros when he is confessing his past ineptness, and Mel in chapters written from her own perspective. In these moments, they seem to be as surprised at the extent of their current powers as anyone. Melisandre in particular seems to be giddy and drunk on the novelty of having real, actual, non-fake visions that sometimes come (misleadingly) true.</p>
<p>We haven't yet seen the Volantis priests like Benerro and Moqorro candidly. So far, we've only seen them showboating and trying to impress. If/when we do see what they're really thinking, I expect there will be some big reveals that tie in with whatever Marwin has observed about whatever this big change is that is happening.</p>

"79544","Why didn't Ned Stark ask for a trial by combat?","<p>I know he has a different religion, but he could have demanded a trial through combat, why not?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","79549","<p>Well, there never was a trial, since Eddard confessed to save his daughter -- so <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Trial_by_combat"">trial by combat</a> could never happen.</p>

<p>Here are the relevant quotes from the books. It starts with Varys visiting Ned in his cell:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Varys tsked. “Cersei will not want to hear that, I promise you.
  Stannis may win the throne, but only your rotting head will remain to
  cheer unless you guard that tongue of yours. Sansa begged so sweetly,
  it would be a shame if you threw it all away. You are being given your
  life back, if you’ll take it. Cersei is no fool. She knows a tame wolf
  is of more use than a dead one.” </p>
  
  <p>“You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king, butchered my
  men, and crippled my son?” Ned’s voice was thick with disbelief. </p>
  
  <p>“I want you to serve the realm,” Varys said. “Tell the queen that you
  will confess your vile treason, command your son to lay down his
  sword, and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir. Offer to denounce
  Stannis and Renly as faithless usurpers. Our green-eyed lioness knows
  you are a man of honor. If you will give her the peace she needs and
  the time to deal with Stannis, and pledge to carry her secret to your
  grave, I believe she will allow you to take the black and live out the
  rest of your days on the Wall, with your brother and that baseborn son
  of yours.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ned isn't very forthcoming, so Varys reminds him that his family is also at risk:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“So what is your answer, Lord Eddard? Give me your word that you’ll
  tell the queen what she wants to hear when she comes calling.”</p>
  
  <p>“If I did, my word would be as hollow as an empty suit of armor. My
  life is not so precious to me as that.”</p>
  
  <p>“Pity.” The eunuch stood. “And your daughter’s life, my lord? How precious is that?” </p>
  
  <p>A chill pierced Ned’s heart.</p>
  
  <p>“My daughter …”</p>
  
  <p>“Surely you did not think I’d forgotten about your sweet innocent, my
  lord? The queen most certainly has not.”</p>
  
  <p>“No,” Ned pleaded, his voice cracking.</p>
  
  <p>“Varys, gods have mercy, do as you like with me, but leave my daughter
  out of your schemes. Sansa’s no more than a child.”</p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <p>Varys gave a long weary sigh, the sigh of a man who carried all the
  sadness of the world in a sack upon his shoulders. “The High Septon
  once told me that as we sin, so do we suffer. If that’s true, Lord
  Eddard, tell me... why is it always the innocents who suffer most, when
  you high lords play your game of thrones? Ponder it, if you would,
  while you wait upon the queen. And spare a thought for this as well:
  The next visitor who calls on you could bring you bread and cheese and
  the milk of the poppy for your pain … or he could bring you Sansa’s
  head. The choice, my dear lord Hand, is entirely yours.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The next time Eddard appears in the book is when Arya sees him confess in public:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Her father raised his voice and began again. “I am Eddard Stark, Lord
  of Winterfell and Hand of the King,” he said more loudly, his voice
  carrying across the plaza, “and I come before you to confess my
  treason in the sight of gods and men.”</p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <p>Her father raised his voice still higher, straining to be heard. “I
  betrayed the faith of my king and the trust of my friend, Robert,” he
  shouted. “I swore to defend and protect his children, yet before his
  blood was cold, I plotted to depose and murder his son and seize the
  throne for myself. Let the High Septon and Baelor the Beloved and the
  Seven bear witness to the truth of what I say: Joffrey Baratheon is
  the one true heir to the Iron Throne, and by the grace of all the
  gods, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All that's left is the sentencing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The High Septon knelt before Joffrey and his mother. “As we sin, so do
  we suffer,” he intoned, in a deep swelling voice much louder than
  Father’s. “This man has confessed his crimes in the sight of gods and
  men, here in this holy place.” Rainbows danced around his head as he
  lifted his hands in entreaty. “The gods are just, yet Blessed Baelor
  taught us that they are also merciful. What shall be done with this
  traitor, Your Grace?”</p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <p>Prince Joffrey … no, King Joffrey … stepped out from behind the
  shields of his Kingsguard. “My mother bids me let Lord Eddard take the
  black, and Lady Sansa has begged mercy for her father.” He looked
  straight at Sansa then, and smiled, and for a moment Arya thought that
  the gods had heard her prayer, until Joffrey turned back to the crowd
  and said, “But they have the soft hearts of women. So long as I am
  your king, treason shall never go unpunished. Ser Ilyn, bring me his
  head!”</p>

            </div></div></p>

<p>The walkers clearly spared these two people because they could have overpowered and killed either.</p>

<p>From a tactical point of view, the walkers gain nothing by sparing anyone. They are better off killing the person and thereby recruiting the person into their undead army. And the downside is that the survivor can warn others who would then flee the walkers. The result is that the walkers have fewer people to recruit because many humans fled.</p>

<p><strong>Is there an explanation for why the White Walkers sometimes spare somebody?</strong></p>

<p>I prefer an answer from the books, but I will take one from the TV shows.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","149587","<p>Three rangers in the Prologue of Game of Thrones were Will, Gared, and Waymar Royce. In the book Will was up a tree, hiding and watching:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“On your feet, Will,” Ser Waymar commanded. “There’s no one here. I
  won’t have you hiding under a bush.”</p>
  
  <p>Reluctantly, Will obeyed.</p>
  
  <p>Ser Waymar looked him over with open disapproval. “I am not going back
  to Castle Black a failure on my first ranging. We will find these
  men.” He glanced around. “<strong>Up the tree. Be quick about it. Look for a
  fire.</strong>” .<br>.<br>.<br>.<br> “<strong>Will, where are you?</strong>” Ser Waymar
  called up. “Can you see anything?” He was turning in a slow circle,
  suddenly wary, his sword in hand. He must have felt them, as Will felt
  them. There was nothing to see. “Answer me! Why is it so cold?”</p>
  
  <p>It was cold. Shivering, <strong>Will clung more tightly to his perch</strong>. His
  face pressed hard against the trunk of the sentinel. He could feel the
  sweet, sticky sap on his cheek.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His commander, Waymar Royce fought the white walkers and died:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Royce went to his knees, shrieking, and covered his eyes. Blood welled
  between his fingers.</p>
  
  <p>The watchers moved forward together, as if some signal had been given.
  Swords rose and fell, all in a deathly silence. It was cold butchery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When he finally came down Royce came back to ""life"" and killed him. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Will rose. Ser Waymar Royce stood over him.</p>
  
  <p>His fine clothes were a tatter, his face a ruin. A shard from his
  sword transfixed the blind white pupil of his left eye.</p>
  
  <p>The right eye was open. The pupil burned blue. It saw.</p>
  
  <p>The broken sword fell from nerveless fingers. Will closed his eyes to
  pray. Long, elegant hands brushed his cheek, then tightened around his
  throat. They were gloved in the finest moleskin and sticky with blood,
  yet the touch was icy cold.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The third ranger, Gared, ran off before the white walkers showed up and was later seen south of the wall. The Starks did not take his talk about white walkers seriously and beheaded him for deserting the Night's Watch.</p>

<p>As for Sam, in Storm of Swords, chapter 18 (first Sam chapter, very close to the end) they are retreating from the Fist of the First Men and encounter a white walker: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And then he was stumbling forward, falling more than running, really, 
  closing his eyes and shoving the dagger blindly out before him with both
  hands. He heard a crack, like the sound ice makes when it breaks beneath
  a man's foot, and then a screech so shrill and sharp that he went 
  staggering backward with his hands over his muffled ears, and fell hard
  on his arse.</p>
  
  <p>When he opened his eyes the Other's armor was running down its legs in 
  rivulets as pale blue blood hissed and steamed around the black dragonglass
  dagger in his throat. It reached down with two bone white hands to pull
  out the knife, but where its fingers touched the obsidian they smoked.</p>

<p>This part is not translated by Missandei. Various internet sources (with the usual limited credibility) claim that this sentence translates as</p>

","<tolkiens-legendarium><the-lord-of-the-rings><game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","150611","<h1>Probably not</h1>

<p>However we do not know for sure, as there's no evidence to suggest that George R. R. Martin <em>wasn't</em> inspired by Tolkien in this particular way.</p>

<p>From my extensive knowledge and a search of many of his talks and posts, I can tell you that he hasn't mentioned this. This is probably because no one has asked him this question in the past<sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p><strong>Let's analyse</strong><br>
Now, there <em>are</em> certain similarities to these characters:</p>

<ul>
<li>Saruman uses literal birds as spies</li>
<li>Varys uses little children which he calls his ""little birds"" as spies</li>
<li>Saruman is a sorcerer of sorts</li>
<li>Varys is an enigmatic character (but says he's against magic)</li>
</ul>

<p>I think that's about where the similarities end. In fact, the point of turning the literal birds controlled by magic (in Saruman's case) into figurative ones which are real (in Varys' case) is actually a big deal. To me, this is an anti-pattern.</p>

<p>You see, although GRRM has said that he is very much inspired by Tolkien's writing in general; for example, he has mentioned on numerous occasions<sup>2</sup> that his magic is ""off screen"" similar to in Tolkien's <em>Lord of the Rings</em> works. However, he tends to find faults<sup>3</sup> in them and goes about ""correcting"" them, adding an even more ""realistic"" approach.</p>

<p><strong>But wait, there's <strike>more</strike> Bloodraven</strong><br>
A better question would be, <strong>is Bloodraven's Raven inspired by Saruman's Crebain?</strong></p>

<li>Gnarly old white magic dude</li>
<li>Controls birds and uses them as spies</li>
<li>You don't know whether he is good or bad, at first</li>

<p>Fast-forward a few seasons to the Battle of Hardhome, and we see multiple walkers and the Night King all wearing clothes and armor. (Never guessed he was just a little vain enough to wear a decoration on his upper chest.)</p>

<p>We saw 4 walkers and the King in the Battle of the Tree all wearing armor.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8f4ym.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/8f4ym.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p><strong>Why did they start wearing armor?</strong> (Related questions: Why would they even care to wear clothes at all? They don't need clothing to protect them from blizzards. Do they make their own armor and clothes?)</p>

<p>I prefer answers from the book (even if the answer says the question is based on a false premise) more than answers from the TV series.</p>

<p><strong>Edit to add:</strong> I am not asking about the wights, just the White Walkers and the Night King. I assume the wights and skeletons have whatever clothes they wore at the moment of re-animation and will wear those until the clothes are so shredded they fall off.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","149703","<p>Since you have added the books tag, I will avoid the show heresy and answer this from the books.</p>
<h3>What do Others aka White Walkers wear?</h3>
<p>In books, others do not run around naked. They are dressed in a special magical armor which camouflages them into their surroundings.</p>
<p>From <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Others"" rel=""noreferrer"">wiki</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Had many talks with George. He told me of the ice swords, and <strong>the
reflective, camouflaging armor that picks up the images of the things
around it like a clear, still pond</strong>. He spoke a lot about what they
were not, but what they were was harder to put into words.&quot;<br> <sub>-<strong>Tommy Patterson</strong> <em>(Comic book artist for the series)</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A shadow emerged from the dark of the wood. It stood in front of
Royce. Tall, it was, and gaunt and hard as old bones, with flesh pale
as milk. <strong>Its armor seemed to change color as it moved; here it was
white as new-fallen snow, there black as shadow, everywhere dappled
with the deep grey-green of the trees.</strong> The patterns ran like
moonlight on water with every step it took.<br><sub>AGOT -
Prologue</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So while we may not know what exactly do they wear due to reflective nature of their garb, we know they wear an armor so presumably some other garment underneath as well. Therefore, The idea that they run around naked or with minimal clothing is absurd.</p>
<p>As far as books are concerned, they always wear armor (Except maybe when it is a nice sunny day, then I presume they go sunbathing on the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Frozen_Shore"" rel=""noreferrer"">Frozen shore</a>).</p>

"149892","Why do these Dothraki look calmer than expected?","<p><strong>Game of Thrones spoiler ahead!</strong></p>

<p>Why do the Dothraki look calm in the ship?</p>

<p>In the final episode <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/The_Winds_of_Winter"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>The Winds of Winter</em></a> (S06E10), a short moment struck me, when we briefly see the Dothraki working in a ship. Here is the <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/The_Winds_of_Winter"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">scene</a>.</p>

<p>They look cool, working on their stuff like if they are used to it:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/c6m41.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/c6m41.jpg"" alt=""Dothraki on a ship""></a></p>

<p>I would expect them to be hiding in the downstairs, or throwing their puke up all over like they did before, <a href=""https://youtu.be/SG3nqbbC1T8?t=95"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sailing to Astapor</a>...</p>

<p>That scene doesn't feature in the books, where they are supposed to be more scared of sea water than death but I don't remember if this fear is mentioned in the show.</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","149903","<p>This isn't the only confusing thing about this scene - people also <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/133013/how-does-varys-travel-so-fast"">get confused about Varys suddenly turning up at the end</a>. Half the answer to this I think is the same as to that - <strong>a heck of a lot of time has passed between this scene and the battle at Mereen</strong> (it'd be nice if they had communicated this more clearly than just having some sails in the fleet which, if you look closely, have Dornish and Tyrell sigils on them... but anyway...). </p>

<p>Enough time passed to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Repaint the sails of a whole fleet, and communicate with Varys somehow to agree a meeting spot for the three fleets (which would also be enough time to train the Dothraki in basic sailing skills, and become more familiar with these big wooden horses)</li>
<li>Sail half way around the world and join up with the Dornish and Tyrell fleets (this would involve much more time at sea than Qarth to Astapor, so they'd all be much more experienced at this point than in any of the scenes from that journey)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>There's also a big <strong>difference between being the first of your people to ever do something, and the second</strong>. As Dany put it <a href=""https://youtu.be/SG3nqbbC1T8?t=1m30s"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">last time, when they <em>were</em> retching their guts out and <em>were</em> all depressed and stuff</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don't mock them. They're the <strong>first Dothraki to ever be on a ship</strong>, and they followed me across the poisoned water. If they follow me, others will too, with a true khalasar</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Last time, they were genuinely terrified, travelling over the notorious poisonous waters in a strange, rickety wooden horse, doing something completely alien to their people. This time, those survivors from the Khal Drogo days have been there, done that, and can set an example for the others.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dothraki follow strength above all else</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It also helps that this time, they're part of a strong khalasar going to war, as opposed to last time, when they were aimless survivors: feeling down before they even got on the ship. As Jorah said in the same scene:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You'll have a true khalasar when you've proved yourself strong, and not before</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this time, they are a true khalasar with a leader who proved herself strong, riding to war like thousands of Dothraki have done proudly for centuries before them. They may be doing it in an unusual way, with wooden horses instead of horsemeat ones, but this new way is tried and tested now. By the time this scene happens, they've had plenty of time at sea to get used to it and (figuratively and literally) learn the ropes. </p>

<p>It'd be strange if this time, they weren't posing, acting tough, trying to out-sailor each other, competing to be the best wooden-horse rider in the army, mocking the weak who still struggle.</p>

<hr>

<p>But yeah, it'd have helped if they'd made the massive time jump before this scene more apparent...</p>

"11503","Why are there no maps of lands east of Westeros in The Game of Thrones?","<p>The <em>Dothraki</em> come from a land (Essos) that is east of Westeros, and separated by the Narrow Sea. But the map given in the book (<em>A Game of Thrones</em>) doesn't show anything beyond Dragonstone. Is there a reason for this?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><game-of-thrones>","11518","<p>I would speculate that it is because - I believe - ASOIAF is largely inspired by <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_the_Roses"">War of the Roses</a>, and Great Britain in general. If you look at the map of Westeros, you will notice a certain resemblance to the British isles. </p>

<p>The War of the Roses' is the war between the houses Lancaster (red rose) and York (white rose), which is rather a good match for house Lannister and Stark, down to the color. Even the location of the city Lancaster is similar to the location of Casterly Rock. We have also have titles, e.g. Lords, knights (called ""Ser""), tourneys, which are all words of English origin.</p>

<p>When you scan a map of England with an eye for ASOIAF details, you will notice many similarities, in shape, location of cities, rivers/bays, etc.</p>

<p>One such very interesting resemblance I found was <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian%27s_Wall"">Hadrian's Wall</a>, an ancient roman fortification in northern England. It is quite similarly located on the map as The Wall in Westeros. Like The Wall, the reasons for erecting Hadrian's Wall are similarly shrouded in mystery. In fact, I just found this quote on the wikipedia page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>American author George R. R. Martin has acknowledged that Hadrian's
  Wall was the inspiration for the wall in his A Song of Ice and Fire
  series.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With all this in mind, it is easy to imagine that GRRM can easily picture Westeros, whereas Essos remains more abstract. Given that the series was at first meant to be a trilogy, it is not even certain that he ever gave Essos much thought, until, of course, the series grew and expanded. And I believe this is the reason we do not have better maps of Essos.</p>

<p>I do not believe we will ever see very detailed maps of Essos in ASOIAF. I think the focus of the series will soon be shifted entirely to Westeros, and also, I think that there is too much focus on scrutinizing GRRMs works for him to have the possibility to sift through all his books and lock down all the details.</p>

<p>Personally, though, I am very interested in seeing a proper map of Valyria and the surrounding areas, to see their empire as it was during their reign.</p>

"12064","Who is Coldhands?","<p>In <em>A Storm of Swords</em>, Sam encounters Coldhands who leads them through the Wall via the Black Gate.  He appears to have once been a Ranger of the Night's Watch, though it's clear he's now dead, and this is confirmed by Leaf in <em>A Dance with Dragons</em>.  He kills pretty indiscriminately both men of the Night's Watch and wights.</p>

<p>Has this been addressed in <em>A Dance with Dragons</em> and I missed it?  Is there speculation?  I have my own thoughts as to who it might be, but I'd be curious to know if anyone else has a legitimate answer to this. </p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","12110","<p>There is speculation on who <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Coldhands"">Coldhands</a> is, as described <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/FAQ/Entry/Who_is_Coldhands/"">here</a> and <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Coldhands/Theories"">here</a>, for example. I'll discuss the <em>The Last Hero</em> and <em>Benjen Stark</em> theories. And also a theory of my own.</p>

<p>The Last Hero is the person from <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Game_of_Thrones-Chapter_24"">Old Nan's story about the Last Hero</a> who went out into the cold north with a squad of men, and was hounded by the Others, seeing his friends, his horse and even his dog die. I believe she tells him this story right after he wakes up from his coma. Quote from the wiki:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thousands of years ago, a winter fell like no other, and there came a
  night that lasted a generation. The Others came during that winter,
  and they hated fire, iron, and the touch of the sun. This was before
  the Andals had come, and before the women of Rhoynar, when the First
  Men lived in the lands they had taken from the Children of the Forest.
  The Others had slaughtered many, and couldn’t be stopped, so the last
  hero of the First Men set out to find the Children. He left with his
  sword, a dog, his horse and twelve companions. When only he was left,
  in despair of ever finding the Children, the Others closed in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The connection between this hero and the Children, who we now know to be connected to Coldhands, somewhat supports the theory of them being one and the same.</p>

<p>The theory is also somewhat supported by Leaf saying <code>""He died long ago""</code>, which may imply that ""long ago"" is too long of a time span to be anyone who died recently, seeing how she is reportedly very old herself.</p>

<p>One interesting piece of information about ""The Last Hero""-Coldhands is that he knows about the Old Gate at the Nightfort, which only brothers of the Night's Watch may pass. Presumably, its existence is not common knowledge, and may imply that Coldhands lived long ago. Although it is easily thwarted by things like (Spoilers for ADWD):</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>It may be <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Brynden_Rivers"">Bloodraven</a>'s/The three eyed-crow's knowledge, which is fairly believable, as we know that he is very well versed in magic, and knows the Wall well, having been the Lord Commander. And: Someone like Benjen Stark might very well have access to such rare knowledge.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, while cold preserves, it does feel -- to me, at least -- a bit unbelievable that even an undead, stored in freezing cold, could last thousands of years.</p>

<p>The evidence of him being Benjen Stark, are even more meager. I believe all we have going for that theory is:</p>

<ul>
<li>He is reportedly a former man of the Night's Watch, as evidenced by him calling Sam ""Brother"" and wearing black clothes.</li>
<li>He saves Sam, is an ally of the <em>Children</em> and the three-eyed crow, and seems to be on the side of the good guys.</li>
<li>His appearance in the story coincides with Benjen's disappearance.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of which are pretty weak, as evidence goes. For example, he could easily be lying about being a black brother, or it could be some misunderstanding that he just never denied. Him being a ""good guy"" could simply be a direct effect of him being the three-eyed crow's minion. And of course, many people disappeared around the time Coldhands appeared, and plenty of black brothers died on the Fist, right before Coldhands appearance.</p>

<p>The single strongest motivating factor (not evidence!) for Benjen = Coldhands might be that people want it to be him: Rather than him being dead, having him reappear as a good guy, taking care of Bran. I myself am one such person, although I would prefer if he would reappear alive.</p>

<p>Hence, my theory largely stems from the happy moment when Sam was saved by Coldhands' flock of ravens, and I was thinking: ""So this is what happened to Benjen!""</p>

<p>One idea that I do like is the combination of the two: That Benjen's fate is shadowing the fate of <em>The Last Hero</em> from Old Nan's tale; that his is a role that is repeated, much like Azor Ahai's.</p>

<p>A personal theory of mine (spoilers ADWD): </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>is that Coldhands could be a friend of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Brynden_Rivers"">Bloodraven</a>, from his days in the Night's Watch. Since he was Lord Commander and a magic user, it could easily be one of his former brothers. Which would make sense of the connection between them, rather than Coldhands being just any random person. It would also support Leaf's statement ""He died long ago."" since Bloodraven is fairly old.

For a wild moment, I was considering if he could be <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dunk"">Dunk</a>, but that would be unlikely, as Dunk is known to have perished at Summerhall with <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon_V_Targaryen"">Egg</a>. We do know that Bloodraven aka Brynden Rivers came to the wall with the honour guard who escort Maester Aemon to the wall, so if this theory is correct, we could find Coldhands among those. There should have been some fairly important names in that group.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While this theory would be interesting, I am much more in favour of the Benjen theory. It feels right, and it feels better. </p>

<p>In short, there is no clear evidence as to who Coldhands is -- or was, before he died. I would say that many things point to his identity being irrelevant, since wights do seem to lose much of their personality when they die, and it is plausible that all we see of Coldhands personality is actually the three-eyed crow's.</p>

<p>My gut feeling is that Coldhands' (former) identity will be revealed. Mostly because GRRM built up some suspense around his character and purposely did not let Bran see his face. And also because I think we will know the fate of Benjen eventually, and as I said, I am a believer in the particular theory that binds those two mysteries together.</p>

"218797","Apart from Arya, do we see anyone else using a light sword, or only hear about them?","<p>Arya Stark's <em>Needle</em> can be described as a <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/77145/46216"">smallsword, or a sort of short rapier</a>. I leave the debate on the exact terminology to that older question; what's important is that both the sword and the manner of its use are markedly different to typical Westerosi practice with its armour and heavier swords.  Syrio Forel implies that Braavosi swordsmen fight and arm themselves differently to Westerosi knights, but we only see him (I think) with wooden training swords.</p>

<p>So apart from Arya, does anyone use (fighting or training) any similar light, slender sword on screen?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But the beauty of Braavos is not only in her buildings. Braavosi swordsmanship is renowned throughout the world. Our Bravos eschew the armor and longswords of the Westerosi knights, preferring speed, agility, and slender blades. The greatest Bravos call themselves Water Dancers after the custom of dueling upon the Moon Pool near the Sealord's Palace. By tradition, the greatest of all the Bravos is the First Sword, who commands the personal guard of the Sealord and protects his person at all public events. Once chosen, a First Sword serve for life. Inevitably, there are always those who wish to cut that life short to affect some change in policy.</p>

<p><strong>Syrio Forel:</strong> Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all. That is the grip. You are not holding a battle-axe. You are holding...</p>
<p><strong>Arya Stark:</strong> A needle.</p>
<p><strong>Syrio Forel:</strong> Ahhh… Just so. Now we will begin the dance. Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning... The knight's dance, hacking and hammering.

"151138","How does Eddard Stark make his money?","<p>If my information is off please correct me, but how do the Starks have and make all their money?</p>

<p>We are shown a few other houses that seem to be extremely rich, but we are also told a little bit about how they are so rich. For instance House Tyrell seems to have vast farmlands and crops to sell for their money and House Lannister has gold mines (which were producing huge amounts of gold until recently).</p>

<p>As far as I can see we are not shown much as to how the Starks are wealthy or how they make their money? We are told that the north is a huge place when Lord Bolton is talking to Ramsay, but how much of that is the Starks'? Do they get their money from taxes for people living on their land? </p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","151139","<blockquote>
<p>We are told that the north is a huge place when Lord Bolton is talking to Ramsay, but how much of that is the Starks'?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The North is indeed a huge place:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The North is by far the largest of the Seven Kingdoms; it can fit the other six inside it.&quot;</p>
<p>– Jon Snow, in the bonus feature &quot;Histories &amp; Lore&quot; on the Season 3 Blu-Ray</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that the tag for the books has been added: The same claim is made in the books, although other sources there claim the North is merely one third of the Seven Kingdoms. Presumably measuring land area is not a perfect science in Westeros. Regardless, the North is big, albeit barren – and the Starks rule all of it (except for &quot;the Gift&quot;, the region extending 150 miles southward from the Wall, which is under the authority of the Night's Watch).</p>
<p>Before Eddard's time, this large area was an independent kingdom ruled by the Starks as Kings in the North for thousands of years, before the Andals invaded Westeros 6000 years ago. The Northerners successfully fended off the Andals, who settled in the Southern regions. According to these legends they've ruled the North continuously for around 8000 years, which has made them very powerful and, yes, rich.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do they get their money from taxes for people living on their land?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eddard Stark represents the Iron Throne as Warden and Lord Paramount of the North, after the Seven Kingdoms were united into one under the Targaryens. With this comes, among other things such as military responsibilities, the responsibility of collecting taxes from the other Northeners.</p>
<p>We don't know how those taxes are budgeted and how much goes to the Iron Throne, but GRRM has <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Social_Structure_Moat_Cailin_and_More"" rel=""noreferrer"">confirmed</a> that the Great Houses make their money from &quot;taxes and customs duties&quot;. In the North's case it's probably mostly taxes, since there are few roads of import there. Northern citizens make their money (which they pay their taxes with) on wool, hides and smithing according to the books, as well as timber, which according to the <em>Game of Thrones</em> Telltale game includes the Ironwood of the wolfswood, exported to build ships all over Westeros.</p>

"81530","How do lords and knights gain land and influence?","<p>There are cases described in the <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> books in which some commoner gains a title of knight/lord, knights gain a title of lord, and lords gain more influence and land - the individual climbs up the feudal ladder. I know that battles are among such cases.</p>

  <p> The most notable example is the Battle of the Blackwater where several honors have been given out after the successful defense of King's Landing.</p>

<p>The first part of the my question is:

<p>For the second part, I am wondering if a knight/lord has some initiative to get a title or land. I mean something like</p>

  <p> Petyr Baelish's conspiracy which turned him from a meaningless, poor, virtually landless lord to high lord of Riverlands.</p>

<p>but on a smaller scale.</p>

<p>Can some petty lord raid and take over some other lord's land (excluding actual war)? What would be the higher lord's reaction? Can a high lord take land from one of his vassals and grant it to the other, or is only the king able to do it?</p>

<p>To sum it up:
<strong>What can a knight/petty lord do to impove his situation in the feudal hierarchy?</strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","81562","<p>Titles and lands are two separate issues.</p>

<h1>Titles</h1>

<ul>
<li>New titles and honours can be arbitrarily made up by the King, as when Baelish is made Lord Paramount of the Trident.</li>
<li>Some existing offices are in the gift of the King and can be reassigned at will, such as seats on the Small Council and positions such as Warden of the North.</li>
<li>Feudal lordships (such as Lord of Winterfell) are inherited rather than granted by the King. These cannot be arbitrarily reassigned, although they may fall vacant if the family has no legitimate heir, or a lord found guilty of treason or rebellion may be stripped of his titles.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Lands</h1>

<p>There are basically three ways of getting new land:</p>

<h2>Conquest</h2>

<p>This is uncommon in Westeros, although it can happen, as when Tywin Lannister took over the lands of the Reynes of Castamere. Historically it was quite common, for example in the Norman Conquest of England; later English conquests in France, Scotland, Ireland and Wales; or events such as the Crusades or the Spanish Reconquista. A ruler would seize new territory and distribute it among his followers.</p>

<p>Most rulers strongly discourage open warfare <em>between</em> their followers; it weakens the realm and undermines the overlord's authority. If the overlord is weak, his or her followers may ignore this and go to war with each other regardless.</p>

<p>Conquest may not be as dramatic as marching off to war with banners flying. It is also possible to gain territory though some combination of intrigue, murder and dirty tricks.</p>

<h2>Marriage/inheritance</h2>

<p>Land isn't bought and sold in a feudal system, so in theory this is the only ""routine"" way of getting new land.</p>

<h2>Confiscation</h2>

<p>As with titles above, a lord's lands may be taken and reassigned as a punishment.</p>

<h1>The Bolton Example</h1>

<p>Roose Bolton is an excellent, albeit extremely ruthless, example of how a lord can rise under this system. Through betrayal, warfare, and murder, as well as marriages (his own and his bastard son's), he rises from a moderately important vassal of Winterfell to become Warden of the North and (arguably) its most powerful lord.</p>

<p>I've read the books and seen the shows but I can't remember if anyone ever explains <em>why</em> no one funds the Wall.</p>

<p>It's pretty important but no one seems to care about it.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","81587","<p>The wildlings have invaded the Seven Kingdoms several times. Every single time, they were crushed before they even reached Winterfell. Typically, they were crushed <em>by</em> the Starks of Winterfell, in their capacity as Warden of the North.</p>

<p>Simply put, the wildlings pose no threat to Highgarden, to Casterly Rock, not even to the Riverlands just below the Neck. So right off the bat, the vast majority of the Kingdoms have basically nothing to gain by sending aid to the Night's Watch, other than ridding itself of criminals and mouths to feed.</p>

<p>But even Northerners see the wildlings as more of a nuisance than an existential threat. As Jon tells Ygritte, Mance Rayder's undisciplined army is bound to lose to the discipline and military tactics of the Seven Kingdoms. </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>He's ultimately proven right when Stannis' force of 1,500 completely decimates Mance's host of 100,000.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even Ned, who is very generous to the Night's Watch, doesn't see Mance Rayder as a threat.</p>

  <p>“And it will only grow worse. The day may come when I will have no
  choice but to call the banners and ride north to deal with this
  King-beyond-the-Wall for good and all.”</p>
  
  <p>“Beyond the Wall?” The thought made Catelyn shudder.</p>
  
  <p>Ned saw the dread on her face. “Mance Rayder is nothing for us to
  fear.” (Eddard I, AGOT)</p>

<p>So when you get down to it, the people south of the Wall neglect it because they don't see any threat that the roughly 1000 brothers of the Night Watch can't handle. Obviously, they've all forgotten that the Wall wasn't built to keep out men...</p>

<p>So for a ship and an unknown amount of gold she will be able to buy 110 Unsullied, or the generous amount of 123 that Kraznys mo Nakloz said he would allow her to have.</p>

<p>In the end she pays for all 8,000 with one dragon. </p>

<p><strong>Is there anything in the books that would allow you to work out how much one Unsullied is worth and therefore know how much she bought the full 8,000 with her single dragon at that time of the dragons development? . Mostly, I want to know how much the Unsullied are worth in common currency on the show.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>*The title is worded that way for tag hits.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","151575","<p>She buys a lot of Unsullied, in the books.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Of thousands, there are eight. Is this what she means
  by all? There are also six centuries, who shall be part of a ninth thousand when complete. Would
  she have them too?”</p>
  
  <p>“I would,” said Dany when the question was put to her. “The eight thousands, the six
  centuries... and the ones still in training as well. The ones who have not earned the spikes.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>She has enough gold and merchandise to buy a thousand, and her crown is worth 100:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Your men have gone
  through my ships and tallied every bead of amber and jar of saffron. How much do I have?”</p>
  
  <p>“Sufficient to be buying one of thousands,” the Good Master said, with a contemptuous smile.</p>
  
  <p>“Yet you are paying double, you are saying. Five centuries, then, is all you buy.”</p>
  
  <p>“Your pretty crown might buy another century,” said the fat one in Valyrian. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this is what she ends up paying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“All your goods, save your crown and your queenly raiment, which we will allow you to keep. The three ships. And Drogon.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Her goods are worth 500, assuming she's paying double.  Three ships are worth 2000:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Three good ships should be worth
  more than a few paltry eunuchs.” </p>
  
  <p>The fat Grazdan turned to the others. They conferred in low voices once again. “Two of the
  thousands,” the one with the spiked beard said when he turned back. “It is too much, but the
  Good Masters are being generous and your need is being great.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The dragon is therefore worth a lot.  Since she buys about 9000 Unsullied plus some more slaves in training, for whom she pays the same amount.  So I'll say the dragon is worth 9500-2500=7000 Unsullied, which is the value of (3*(7000/2000))=10 and a half ships.  One Unsullied is 3/2000 the price of a ship.</p>

<p><strong>So how much is a ship?</strong></p>

<p>In the words of Salladhor Saan in <em>Clash of Kings,</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the Red Keep we shall feast, while the dwarf sings us a jolly tune. When you speak to King
  Stannis, mention if you would that he will owe me another thirty thousand dragons come the black of the moon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Saan has 30 ships.  One sellsail in a month costs 1000 dragons.  But we still don't know the cost of a ship for buying.  This is the closest I can find to evidence.</p>

<p>The economy in Westeros is interesting.  It isn't as much based on money as on value.  Prices aren't set, they're bargained.  In Essos, for example, a slave is a perfectly good unit of value, like a coin.  And an Unsullied is a more valuable slave in the same way that a gold coin's value changes based on its weight.  In the transaction that took place with the Unsullied, no gold traded hands, only goods.  So I would say that it's unfair to judge the price of an Unsullied in gold.  One robot-slave-eunech-soldier thing is worth whatever one is willing to pay for a robot-slave-eunech-soldier thing.  One dragon is worth however much you're willing to pay for it, especially since dragons have never been sold before, and so don't have a price.</p>

<p>There are only 200 such swords known in all of Westeros. Even the wealthy Lannisters tried to buy a Valyrian steel sword, but not even a minor house would not sell such a precious item to the Lannisters.</p>

<p><strong>Did Lyanna Mormont ever ask Jon Snow to return Longclaw to her family?</strong></p>

</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Although if and when it is not enough for the Iron Bank, they will still have their due...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The banker pressed his fingers together. &quot;It would not be proper for me to discuss Lord Stannis' indebtedness or lack of same.

<p>He did not have to like it, though. And come spring, when the time came to repay all that gold, he would like it even less. Tycho Nestoris had impressed him as cultured and courteous, but <strong>the Iron Bank of Braavos had a fearsome reputation when collecting debts.</strong> Each of the Nine Free Cities had its bank, and some had more than one, fighting over every coin like dogs over a bone, but <strong>the Iron Bank was richer and more powerful than all the rest combined.</strong> When princes defaulted on their debts to lesser banks, ruined bankers sold their wives and children into slavery and opened their own veins. <strong>When princes failed to repay the Iron Bank, new princes sprang up from nowhere and took their thrones.</strong></p>

His shadowcat used to fight “him wildly, and the snow bear had gone half-mad for a time, snapping at trees and rocks and empty air, but this was worse. “Get out, get out!” he heard her own mouth shouting. Her body staggered, fell, and rose again, her hands flailed, her legs jerked this way and that in some grotesque dance as his spirit and her own fought for the flesh. She sucked down a mouthful of the frigid air, and Varamyr had half a heartbeat to glory in the taste of it and the strength of this young body before her teeth snapped together and filled his mouth with blood. She raised her hands to his face. He tried to push them down again, but the hands would not obey, and she was clawing at his eyes. Abomination, he remembered, drowning in blood and pain and madness. When he tried to scream, she spat their tongue out.”</p>

  <p>Is Bran, a male highborn, entitled to a hand servant? </p>

<p>I think the simplest answer that can be given here is: Yes, if he can afford it. <br>
Highborn people with money can afford hand servants, so they can have as many as they want.</p>

<p>I wouldn't call Hodor a slave. Slaves are like those people Daenerys meets on Slaver's Bay (and releases them). People that have no freedom at all. Slaves are what people used Africans for on the U.S. plantations so many years ago.</p>

<p>Hodor would be more like an in-house help or servant. Rich people still have this kind of help nowadays. They don't feed them the best food, but they are free.</p>

<p>I don't recall any mention of Hodor making complains (I know he can't talk, but he does express his feelings). So, he must think that his job is okay. He is a mentally challenged person that would have trouble at pretty much any job. But instead, he lives and works with a family that respects and loves him. I actually find that good-hearted.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Like I mentioned above I don't think Bran is actually abusing Hodor. He does what every person with a servant would do. Also, take note that Game of Thrones doesn't take place in the 21st century. It takes place in a fictional Medieval-themed world. That means that people don't have the human rights you and I do.<br></li>
<li>We don't really know how much free will Hodor has or how he ended up working for the Starks. The fact that his grandma (Old Nan) worked there for many years might have played some role.  Also, like I mentioned above, we pretty much can assume that he wouldn't be the best in some other work<br></li>
<li>The Starks actually feel like he is a part of their family.</li>

<h1><strong>In the Books</strong></h1>

<p>In the books, <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Valyrian_steel"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Valyrian steel</a> has a noticeable ""ripple"" effect to the metal, probably similar to a Damascus blade. It's also been described as having a ""smoky"" look.</p>

<p>Also, it was stated by a blacksmith that</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> the two longswords forged from Ice (Oathkeeper &amp; Widow's Wail) would not hold the crimson color requested by Tywin Lannister, but instead kept reverting to a smoky merger of crimson and silver.</p>

<p>Thus we can assume that the metal has unique qualities causing this effect. Anyone who knows what to look for could therefore easily tell Valyrian steel from even the finest non-Valyrian steel.</p>

<hr>

<h1><strong>On the TV Show</strong></h1>

<p>The Valyrian swords in the TV show appear to have a much higher polish to the blade. The higher polish causes it to be much more reflective, almost a chrome effect. In fact, in several scenes, Longclaw appears to almost have a glowing effect to it - very subtle, but there nonetheless.</p>

<p>This is most noticeable in Season 4 during the </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> When Lancel Lannister and the other Sparrows go to retrieve Cersei from the Keep for her trial, Lancel begins following a small child into the area underneath the Sept. The child then stabs Lancel, followed by the scene depicting Lancel crawling in an effort to blow out the flame.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does this scene have any significance, or was it just a set up to show the audience what was happening/to come? Was it included in the novel?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","152340","<p>The books haven't gotten that far yet. This is likely to come in the upcoming novel ""<em>The Winds of Winter</em>"" (which has the same title as the final episode). So I can't help give you an answer from the books.</p>

<p>From the show's point of view however, having Lancel follow one of the ""Little Birds"" into the tunnels under the Sept gave us an idea of how the explosion was set up and how it would take place. It is likely Lancel would've died either way, however by having him be led into the Sept's cellar not only gives the viewers an idea of the scale of the operation, but also keeps alive the possibility that Lancel can save the Sept and everyone inside.</p>

<p>This answer is very opinionated, since it is the final episode in the TV series, and has not yet been mentioned in the novels.</p>

<hr>

<p>I was however able to find an interview with the actor where he discusses the scene a little bit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What was it like crawling through the corridor?</strong><br>
  The thing about the whole scene was that for the last two years, we’ve seen Lancel be this stoic, disciplined, focused individual, with a rather limited demonstration of much emotion. But when the worst happens to him, and he finds himself staring death in the face, he tries to do his utmost to solve it. He doesn’t give up. He doesn’t cry. But he is, for the first time we’ve seen in a while, really brave. He wants to make sure everything he’s worked for doesn’t go up in flames. And having just suddenly been paralyzed, and being on his own, with no one around him, he would probably bleed to death anyway if he didn’t get the candles out in time. And yet, he still does his best. I found that to be rather emotional, because for all of his bad choices, all the bad things that have happened to him, he still tries his very hardest to do what he believes to be right. And that made him vulnerable again. I could have played that entire reaction very robotically, the way he’s been. But instead, I let him cry out in pain and didn’t deprive him of his humanity. He was still human. He was scared. He didn’t want to die. But I am glad that my character has died the way he has. It was quite a cathartic experience for me.<br>

<p>I am currently re-reading the books and it's kind of hard to keep track of time or distance with all the different POVs. </p>

<p>Knowing how big the continent is, it would be helpful to put things in a better perspective. For example, I have no idea if it took 3 days for the Starks to go from Winterfell to King's Landing, or 3 months. </p>

<h1>Longer Version</h1>
<h3>How do ASOIAF regions compare to our world?</h3>
<p>George R.R. Martin has compared Westeros to South America and Essos to Eurasia . He <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Geography"" rel=""noreferrer"">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will post the dates and times of my signing tour in the &quot;touring&quot;
thread uptopic. Thanks for asking.</p>
<p>As for your other questions (boy, you folks are relentless), <strong>I don't</strong>
<strong>have the precise population of King's Landing on[sic] the exact area of</strong>
<strong>Westeros immediately on hand.</strong></p>
<p>In very general terms, however... King's Landing is more populous than
medieval London or Paris, but not so populous as medieval
Constantinople or ancient Rome.</p>
<p>Some readers have likened Westeros to England because they see some
general similarities in its shape, and in its location off the west
coast of a larger landmass. The latter is true enough (I don't see the
former, myself), but <strong>Westeros is much much MUCH bigger than Britain</strong>.
<strong>More the size (though not the shape, obviosuly) of South America</strong>, I'd
say.</p>
<p><strong>The other continent is bigger (Essos), Eurasia size.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, a league is three miles.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3>Should you worry about how long it takes to travel in Westeros and how big it is?</h3>
<p>Also George R.R. Martin is deliberately vague about such matters. He said in another <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/2787"" rel=""noreferrer"">correspondence with the fans</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I have deliberately tried to be vague about such things, so I don't have obsessive fans with rulers measuring distances on the map and
telling me Ned couldn't get from X to Y in the time I say he did</strong>.</p>
<p>However, if you really must know, <strong>you can figure out the distances
for yourself. The Wall is a hundred leagues long. A league is three
miles. Go from there.</strong></p>
<p>But if you turn up any mistakes in travel times by using that measure,
let it be your secret.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3>You really wanna know, don't you?</h3>
<p>If, to quote GRRM, you are really that obsessed fan, Well put that calculator and ruler back. <a href=""https://atlasoficeandfireblog.wordpress.com/2016/02/28/the-size-and-extent-of-westeros/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Another fan has roughly done the work</a> for you by estimating the size. According to his/her findings:</p>

I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all nights to come. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why do they need to vow that? Why celibacy is important for the order? </p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","14313","<p>I believe the vows of the Night's Watch go back through the ages, in the order of thousands of years, back to mythical heroes like Brandon the Builder and before him. GRRM has allowed his characters somewhat free interpretation of what these vows mean.</p>

<p>Sam (and Bran's group) was made aware of the old gate, under the Nightfort, which tied the vow to the gate's magical quality. I believe there are more such ancient magical qualities tied to the vow. There seems to be some purpose to Jon and Sam saying their vows before a heart tree, for example.</p>

<p>Many black brothers seem to believe that protecting the realm from wildlings is the core of the oath, whereas we have seen that Stannis and Jon have made the interpretation that their duty is to protect the realms of <em>men</em>, in which wildlings are considered on the side of the realm. I believe this comes close to the original intent of the vow. As Lord Commander Mormont said (paraphrasing):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You don't build a wall hundreds of feet high to keep out raiders.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the time when the oath was conceived, I believe the intent was to form an elite guard force, whose sole task was to guard against the ancient evil, the Long Night, The Great Other. As is mentioned in many of Jon's chapters, I cannot remember if it was Maester Aemon or Lord Commander Mormont, family ties are strong, and the ones who test a man's oath the hardest.</p>

<p>While other men might be part of the realm; Lords, servants, knights, fathers, etc, the Night's Watch stands outside it. They have severed all ties to it. Their sole focus is the danger north of the wall. It is in their name: The Night's Watch, they who watch against the Long Night.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Night gathers, and now my watch begins.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are watchmen. Not primarily soldiers, or an army.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>It shall not end until my death.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Making this pledge binds you forever, so that you shall never have any cause to think of your <em>past</em> or your <em>future</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the meat of the pledge: To forever forsake your claim to your place in the realm.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold,
  the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the
  shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to
  the Night's Watch, for this night and all nights to come.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This last part to me has always revolved around ""the watcher on the walls"", ""I shall live and die at my post"" and ""the horn that wakes the sleepers,"" -- which also ties into the very dramatic 1-2-3 blasts of their horn signals: Once for rangers returning, twice for wildlings, three times for Others.</p>

<p>While other people, such as for example the Lord of Winterfell and his men, may take up arms against the enemies of the realm, they are not pledged to guard against the Long Night, their attention may be divided. They might enjoy coming home a cold evening, sitting in front of their fire with their children and turning a blind eye to the dark and cold night outside.</p>

<p>But someone has to be the one to keep watch, to wake the sleepers, to bear witness to strange events, to listen to the forest and sense the creeping cold. Someone who spends his life in the cold and empty forests and learns how to read its signs.</p>

<p>Much like in the prologue to AGOT, Gared and Will could sense something was wrong, but Ser Waymar Royce could not.</p>

<p>I guess in short it boils down to no division of loyalty and no distractions. Much like any knight can protect the king in his own right, and has his own place in the protection around the king, a knight of the Kingsguard has the duty of being the first and innermost line of defense. His watchfulness can never waver for a second, as Ser Barristan notes in ADWD:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But the battle was never truly done for a knight of the Kingsguard. Threats came from everywhere and nowhere, at any time of day or night. [....] For every hour of fighting, a Kingsguard knight spent ten thousand hours watching, waiting, standing silent in the shadows. King Hizdahr's pit fighters were already growing bored and restive with their new duties, and bored men were lax, slow to react.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think Lord Commander Mormont demonstrated it the best. On their ranging, he comes to the conclusion that something very bad is happening, that the wall and the Night's Watch's purpose is not what they thought. He was able to make that deduction because his only focus in life is being the watcher on the walls. That guard who has spent thousands of hours watching and recognizes the danger in time.</p>

The blade was engraved with a delicate silver tracery of a mountain sky; its pommel was a falcon’s head, its crossguard fashioned into the shape of wings. “I had that sword crafted for Jon in King’s Landing,”</p>
<p>&quot;I thought it only fitting that our champion avenge Jon with his own blade.&quot;</p>
<p><sub><sup><strong>A Game of Thrones, Chapter 40, Cateyln</strong> </sub></sup></p>

<p><strong>Loyalty to Lady Lysa:</strong></p>
<p>Even when most knights realized Ser Vardis was in trouble, Lady Lysa commanded him to fight on and he fought.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blind with arrogance as they were, even the knights and lords of the Vale could see what was happening below them, yet her sister could not. “Enough, Ser Vardis!” Lady Lysa called down. “Finish him now, my baby is growing tired.”</p>
<p>And it must be said of Ser Vardis Egen that he was true to his lady’s command, even to the last. One moment he was reeling backward, half-crouched behind his scarred shield; the next he charged. The sudden bull rush caught Bronn off balance.</p>

<p>What is the meaning of those dreams? Does the three-eyed raven has an universal symbolism that I don't know about?</p>

<p>The show names it the <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Three-eyed_raven"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Three-eyed Raven</a>.
The books calls it the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Three-eyed_crow"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Three-eyed Crow</a>.</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","14568","<p>The meaning (and identity) behind the three-eyed crow is revealed in <em>A Dance With Dragons</em>.</p>

<p>Until then, earlier in the series the three-eyed crow represents a mysterious mentor, who can act as some sort of guide for Bran (teaching him how to ""fly""), as revealed both by Bran's dreams and Jojen Reed's greendreams.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> In <em>A Dance with Dragons</em> Bran and the Reeds reach the three-eyed crow, who is revealed to be a powerful skinchanger and greenseer, who resides underground with a population of remaining Children of the Forest.  He was, at one time, a member of the Night's Watch, but now sits on his underground seat encased by weirwood roots, using his skinchanging and greenseer powers to unknown purposes.  He begins to teach Bran how to use those same powers, opening Bran's ""third eye"", which is a reference to Bran learning to unlock his greenseer powers.</p>

<p>Out of universe, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_eye"">""third eye"" or ""inner eye""</a> is a reference to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajna"">brow chakra</a>, and being able to open the third eye is said to allow great spiritual insight, or even the ability to enter into another's body.</p>

"14629","Why is Petyr Baelish called ""Littlefinger""?","<p>Petyr Baelish is constantly referred to as ""Littlefinger,"" and some mention that he doesn't like this name.</p>

<p>The first thing that comes to mind is that it's because he is not physically well-equipped, but I doubt that's the real reason.</p>

<p>What is the backstory behind his nickname?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","14630","<p>The Fingers are rocky peninsulae near the Vale of Arryn, and Petyr's father was the lord of the smallest of them. And he is relatively short of stature, both as an adult and as a child when he was given the nickname.</p>

<p>He doesn't like this nickname as it points out he's just a minor lord and pretty much mocks him for being short sized.</p>

<p>Quoting directly from ""A Game of Thrones"" by George RR Martin; </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Catelyn’s mouth grew tight. “Littlefinger,” she murmured. His face
  swam up before her; a boy’s face, though he was a boy no longer. His
  father had died several years before, so he was Lord Baelish now, yet
  still they called him Littlefinger. Her brother Edmure had given him
  that name, long ago at Riverrun. His family’s modest holdings were on
  the smallest of the Fingers, and Petyr had been slight and short for
  his age.</p>

<p>Ned Stark replies to this with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;No. Now it ends.&quot;</p>

<p>What was Arthur referring to? What is the thing that is now beginning?</p>
<p>I'm fairly certain that <em>The Sword of The Morning</em> knew he was a dead man and wanted his last words to be meaningful.</p>
<p>It is clear to everyone that only one team is walking away from this fight. Arthur and Oswell (or Gerold whatever floats your boat) both seem very confident in their chances and rightly so.</p>
<p>However, Arthur wishes Ned &quot;Good fortune in the wars to come.&quot;</p>
<p>To me this seems to indicate that Arthur knew that Ned was going to survive the fight.</p>
<p>So what did Arthur's last words actually mean? I'm fairly sure we don't have concrete evidence so speculation is welcome.</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","153054","<h3>Show Perspective</h3>
<p>It was just something a warrior would say prior to the battle.</p>
<p>He said:</p>

<p>Ned replied:</p>

<p>There is no special hidden meaning to what Arthur Dayne said.</p>
<p>And not all last words are meaningful. Remember Tyrion's &quot;Last words&quot; when he thought executioners had come for him at last?</p>

<p>As the keys rattled and the door to his cell pushed inward, creaking,
Tyrion pressed back against the dampness of the wall, wishing for a
weapon. I can still bite and kick. I'll die with the taste of blood in

some rousing last words. &quot;Bugger you all&quot; was not like to earn him

<p>When he wished Ned luck in the wars to come, there are three possible reasons for it:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Arthur Dayne was known as personification of chivalry. It was just a chivalrous gesture and sits well with his character.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Arthur Dayne subtly implied that the war was far from over and eventually the exiled Prince Viserys and his unborn sibling (As Daenerys was not born then) would come back to retake their right.</p>

<li><p>Arthur obviously knew that:</p>

<h3>Books Perspective</h3>
<p>Not to mention, he never said that in the books. He was courteous, but he didn't say that &quot;I wish you luck&quot; thingie as it is, as you observed, tantamount to giving up.</p>
<p>They however must have known that they were going to be killed as they had decided that they were not going to flee. It was about Honor of Kingsguard and a Kingsguard doesn't flee and gives his life for those of the royal blood.</p>
<p>Full conversation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I looked for you on the Trident,” Ned said to them.</p>
<p>“We were not there,” Ser Gerold answered. “Woe to the Usurper if we
had been,” said Ser Oswell.</p>
<p>“When King's Landing fell, Ser Jaime slew your king with a golden
sword, and I wondered where you were.”</p>
<p>“Far away,” Ser Gerold said, “or Aerys would yet sit the Iron Throne,
and our false brother would burn in seven hells.”</p>
<p>“I came down on Storm's End to lift the siege,” Ned told them, and the
Lords Tyrell and Redwyne dipped their banners, and all their knights
bent the knee to pledge us fealty. I was certain you would be among
them.”</p>
<p><strong>“Our knees do not bend easily,” said Ser Arthur Dayne.</strong></p>
<p>“Ser Willem Darry is fled to Dragonstone, with your queen and Prince
Viserys. I thought you might have sailed with him.”</p>
<p>“Ser Willem is a good man and true,” said Ser Oswell.</p>
<p>“But not of the Kingsguard,” Ser Gerold pointed out. “The Kingsguard
does not flee.”</p>
<p><strong>“Then or now,” said Ser Arthur. He donned his helm.</strong></p>
<p>“We swore a vow,” explained old Ser Gerold.</p>
<p>Ned’s wraiths moved up beside him, with shadow swords in hand. They
were seven against three.</p>
<p><strong>“And now it begins,” said Ser Arthur Dayne</strong>, the Sword of the Morning. He unsheathed Dawn and held it with both hands. The blade was
pale as milkglass, alive with light.</p>
<p><strong>“No,” Ned said with sadness in his voice. “Now it ends.”</strong><br><br><sub><em>A Game of Thrones - Eddard X</em></sub></p>

"83340","Was Stannis expected to pay the existing debts of Westeros?","<p>I don't quite understand why the Iron Bank agreed to loan money to Stannis Baratheon to fund his army.  If he lost, they were out of pocket for the money loaned, and if he won, they were out of pocket for the money they had previously loaned to Robert Baratheon/Westeros.</p>

<p>..Or were they?  Was there an understanding that on winning, Stannis would repay not just his own debts, but those of Robert Baratheon/Westeros?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","83341","<p>Yes, he would have been expected to pay those debts, if he won. That money was lent to the Iron Throne - the government of the Seven Kingdoms - and not to Robert Baratheon personally. Since Stannis was claiming that he was the rightful heir to the throne, he was implicitly saying that he would also inherit the debts.</p>

<p>In fact, one of the reasons they agreed to fund Stannis is because Tywin Lannister had been vocal about <em>not</em> honoring Robert's debts, despite also claiming that his sons were the rightful heirs to the throne. So, in the Iron Bank's mind, funding Stannis's attempts to retake the throne was a risky investment, but also the one they felt most likely to get them their money repaid. Davos basically says as much when he's trying to convince them to help out.</p>

<p>(It's not clear how much Twyin really thought he could get away with ignoring the Iron Bank; he tells Olenna that he's not afraid of them, but that would be a rather idiotic position for someone of Tywin's financial acumen to take.)</p>

<hr>

<p>In the novels, I believe it is made more explicit that the Iron Bank's help is <em>specifically predicated</em> on Stannis repaying the Iron Throne's existing debts. Here, it's Cersei, not Tywin, that decides to stop repaying their loans, which I find infinitely more  plausible. It's also made much more clear that the Iron Bank is in the habit of funding the enemies of people who default on their loans, which is essentially what they're doing with Stannis.</p>

"14829","How is The Wall bypassed?","<p>In the first series of the TV show several things apparently bypass <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/The_Wall"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Wall</a> to reach Winterfell:</p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","14830","<p>Yes, it's clarified in the book.</p>

<p>Wildlings:</p>

<p>Night's Watch:</p>

  <p> There are secret passages known to the Night's Watch and some that are magically closed to all except sworn brothers.  I don't think it's ever clearly stated how Will got south of the wall, and in the book it's <em>not</em> Will that survives.</p>

<p>Dire Wolves:</p>

<p>Doesn't really need a spoiler tag, they could go around the wall in the West: the wall stops at The Shadow Tower which is <em>not</em> all the way at the coast.  It's mentioned that Wildlings sometimes slip through the hills on that side and there's also a mention of ""The Bridge of Skulls.""  The watch is concerned with people, so a direwolf could probably slip through.</p>

  <p>Oh, my name is quite long and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce. I am simply a trader of spices.</p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","153204","<h1>Books</h1>
<p>The de-jure rulers of Qarth are <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Pureborn"" rel=""noreferrer"">the Pureborn</a>, not the Thirteen or any other merchant faction.</p>
<h3>Factions in Qarth</h3>
<p>Following factions vie for dominance over Qarth:</p>

</ol>
<p>The actual de-jure authority of Qarth is the Pureborn. They are descendants of the ancient Kings and Queens of Qarth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Descendants of the ancient kings and queens of Qarth, the Pureborn
commanded the Civic Guard and the fleet of ornate galleys that ruled
the straits between the seas <br><br><sub>ACOK- Daenerys III</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was the pureborn that Daenerys had turned to, to plea for aid against Robert Baratheon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Pureborn heard her pleas from the great wooden seats of their
ancestors, rising in curved tiers from a marble floor to a high-domed
ceiling painted with scenes of Qarth's vanished glory. The chairs were
immense, fantastically carved, bright with goldwork and studded with
amber, onyx, lapis, and jade, each one different from all the others,
and each striving to be the most fabulous. Yet the men who sat in them
seemed so listless and world-weary that they might have been asleep.
They listened, but they did not hear, or care, she thought. They are
Milk Men indeed. They never meant to help me. They came because they
were curious. They came because they were bored, and the dragon on my
shoulder interested them more than I did.<br><br><sub>ACOK- Daenerys

seas, were divided into three jealous factions: the Ancient Guild of
Spicers, the Tourmaline Brotherhood, and the Thirteen, to which Xaro
belonged.<br><br><sub>ACOK- Daenerys III</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>History of Qarth</h3>
<p>Qarth was founded by <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Qaathi"" rel=""noreferrer"">Qaathi</a> people who originated in the Dothraki sea region in the earliest days of humanity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What can be said is that the Qaathi arose in the grasslands and
established towns there, coming into contact and occasional conflict
with the Sarnori. They would oft have the worse of these wars, and so
began to drift farther south, creating new city-states. One such,
Qarth, was founded on the coast of the Summer Sea. Yet the lands in
the south of Essos proved more inhospitable than those the Qaathi had
vacated, turning to desert even as they established their foothold
there. The Qaathi people were already well on their way to collapse
when the Doom struck, and any hopes of using the chaos in the Summer
Sea to their advantage vanished when the Dothraki attacked, destroying
all the remaining Qaathi cities save for Qarth
itself.<br><br><sub>TWOIAF- Beyond the Free Cities: The
Grasslands</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of the Qaathi cities were destroyed due to Dothraki invasions after fall of Valyria and ensuing <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/143194/54887"">century of blood</a> save for Qarth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the south, other khals led their hordes into the Red Waste,
destroying the Qaathi towns and cities that once dotted that desert,
until only the great city of Qarth remained, protected by its towering
triple wall. Despite their long history, little can be said with any
certainty of the Qaathi—a people now gone from the world save for a
remnant in Qarth.<br><br>.<br><br>.<br><br>.<br></p>
<p>Most of these peoples are gone now, their cities burned and buried,
their gods and heroes all but forgotten. Of the Qaathi cities, only
Qarth remains, dreaming of past glories beside the jealously guarded
Jade Gates, which link the Summer and Jade seas. The others were
extinguished, driven into exile, or conquered and assimilated by the
people who succeeded them.<br><br><sub>TWOIAF- Beyond the Free Cities:
The Grasslands</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Due to the city's strategic position on the eastern sea lanes, it soon turned into a trade hub which expanded when the Valyrian seapower vanished and Volantis became too occupied with its own ambitions west-wards during century of blood era.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet in a way, the Dothraki destruction led to a resurgence for Qarth.
Forced to look instead to the sea, the Pureborn who ruled Qarth
swiftly constructed a fleet and took control of the Jade Gates—the
strait between Qarth and Great Moraq, which joins the Summer Sea to
the Jade Sea. With the Valyrian fleet destroyed, and Volantis's
attention turned west, there were none to oppose them as they
established control over the most direct route between east and west,
and so gained immeasurably in both trade and levied tolls for safe
passage.<br><br><sub>TWOIAF- Beyond the Free Cities: The Grasslands</sub></p>

<h1>Show</h1>
<p>In the Show however, it is implied that its the thirteen who rule the city and other rival factions and the pureborn are not mentioned as separate entities.</p>
<p>It seems to be one of the many changes show-runners made to limit the scope of events and things they had to film as it must have seemed inconsequential to the eventual planned story-arc they took in the show. The titles Spice-King, Silk-King and Copper-King are also their own invention, not adapted from the books. Although Westerosi nobles do use &quot;Spice Lords&quot; or &quot;Cheese Kings&quot; to refer to Essosi merchant quasi-aristocrat-class in a derogatory fashion. &quot;Merchant Prince&quot; has however been used in the books, a title Xaro Xhoan Daxos introduced himself with.</p>
<p>In any case, there is no mention of political history of Qarth in GoT so it is unknown how did they come to rule Qarth in the show.</p>

"15019","Who was the other man Ned despised?","<p>On page 200 in <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, Catelyn tells Ned that Littlefinger will help them. In the following paragraph, Ned thinks</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It would not be the first time that Ned had been forced to make common cause with a man he despised.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reading this casually, one might just think that it is a pragmatic statement, but seeing as <em>A Game of Thrones</em> in general, and Ned's chapters in particular are so riddled with vague statements of great import, I was immediately intrigued as to whether this refers to a specific person.</p>

<p>My first, and as of yet only, thought was</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> that it was Rhaegar. When Lyanna died, she made Ned promise (<em>Promise me, Ned</em>) to shield Rhaegar's son from Robert. So in a sense, Ned would have made common cause with someone he'd have reason to harbour animosity against.<p>
However, it does not quite ring true. Lyanna and Rhaegar's disappearance seems to have been them simply falling in love, and Ned would hardly in good conscience <em>despise</em> the man Lyanna loved. Ned's feelings of despise seem to be reserved only for people who behave dishonourably. I also doubt very much that Rhaegar had anything to do with Lyanna dying (besides getting her pregnant). So, it does not feel quite right that Ned should despise him.<p>
Also, of course, Rhaegar was not actually around at the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tower_of_Joy"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>Tower of Joy</em></a>, and it does not seem likely that he had a conversation with any of the Kingsguard, since he killed them all. (Besides, they were honourable men, so he would not despise them).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But if not him, then who? Varys? Roose Bolton? Jorah Mormont? Someone across the narrow sea? Is there some reference I have missed?</p>

<p>I just remembered something from ADWD:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>In the Davos chapter where he talks to the Lord of Sisterton Ned Stark is mentioned as having passed through there and saying something like ""If I fail, I was never here."" There is also mention (possibly red herring) about a fish wife and a bag of silver. A smuggler would be someone Ned would have cause to despise... seems personal enough, but pretty thin.</p>
</blockquote>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","189433","<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> It's never made explicit in the text itself but there are some options for who it is likely to be. I will list them roughly in order of most to least likely though Tywin Lannister is the most likely candidate.</p>

<hr>

<p>Ned had to make common cause with the Lannister's after Robert's Rebellion due to Tywin funding the Seven Kingdoms and Robert having married Cersei. He doesn't appear to have gotten over some of their actions though.</p>

<h3>Tywin Lannister</h3>

<p>He makes it clear in these passages that he distrusts Tywin and has no care for him even going as far as to be prepared to insult him.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Ned would sooner entrust a child to a pit viper than to Lord Tywin</strong>, but he left his doubts unspoken. Some old wounds never truly heal, and bleed again at the slightest word. ""The wife has lost the husband,"" he said carefully. ""Perhaps the mother feared to lose the son. The boy is very young.""</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>""A generous offer, my friend,"" the king said, ""but too late. Lord Tywin has already given his consent. Fostering the boy elsewhere would be a grievous affront to him.""</p>
  
  <p>""<strong>I have more concern for my nephew's welfare than I do for Lannister pride</strong>,"" Ned declared.</p>
  
  <p><sup>A Game of Thrones, Eddard I</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He also thinks of Tywin as a murderer of innocents and appears to despise him still for giving the orders to kill the children.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ned did not feign surprise; Robert's hatred of the Targaryens was a madness in him. <strong>He remembered the angry words they had exchanged when Tywin Lannister had presented Robert with the corpses of Rhaegar's wife and children as a token of fealty. Ned had named that murder;</strong> Robert called it war. When he had protested that the young prince and princess were no more than babes, his new-made king had replied, ""I see no babes. Only dragonspawn."" Not even Jon Arryn had been able to calm that storm. Eddard Stark had ridden out that very day in a cold rage, to fight the last battles of the war alone in the south. It had taken another death to reconcile them; Lyanna's death, and the grief they had shared over her passing.</p>
  
  <p>This time, Ned resolved to keep his temper. ""Your Grace, the girl is scarcely more than a child. <strong>You are no Tywin Lannister, to slaughter innocents.</strong>"" It was said that Rhaegar's little girl had cried as they dragged her from beneath her bed to face the swords. The boy had been no more than a babe in arms, yet Lord Tywin's soldiers had torn him from his mother's breast and dashed his head against a wall.</p>
  
  <p><sup>A Game of Thrones, Eddard II</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He also thinks of the man as dishonourable for when he betrayed the Mad King during the Sack of King's Landing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Not our men,"" Ned said patiently. ""Lannister men. The lion of Lannister flew over the ramparts, not the crowned stag. <strong>And they had taken the city by treachery.</strong>""</p>
  
  <p>The war had raged for close to a year. Lords great and small had flocked to Robert's banners; others had remained loyal to Targaryen. The mighty Lannisters of Casterly Rock, the Wardens of the West, *had remained aloof from the struggle**, ignoring calls to arms from both rebels and royalists. Aerys Targaryen must have thought that his gods had answered his prayers when Lord Tywin Lannister appeared before the gates of King's Landing with an army twelve thousand strong, professing loyalty. <strong>So the mad king had ordered his last mad act. He had opened his city to the lions at the gate.</strong></p>
  
  <p><sup>A Game of Thrones, Eddard II</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Jaime Lannister</h3>

<p>Like Tywin he doesn't appear to trust Jaime very much hoping that Robert won't name him Warden to the East because that would mean he would eventually hold the Est and West.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Kingslayer,"" Ned said. The rumors were true, then. He rode on dangerous ground now, he knew. ""An able and courageous man, no doubt,"" he said carefully, ""but his father is Warden of the West, Robert. In time Ser Jaime will succeed to that honor. No one man should hold both East and West."" <strong>He left unsaid his real concern; that the appointment would put half the armies of the realm into the hands of Lannisters.</strong></p>
  
  <p><sup>A Game of Thrones, Eddard II</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again he reiterates that he doesn't trust Jaime and even spells it out clearly for Robert. He even thinks he is dishonourable for sitting himself atop the Iron Throne. He also appears to dislike Jaime's arrogance and cockiness.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>""Can you trust Jaime Lannister?""</strong></p>
  
  <p>""He is my wife's twin, a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard, his life and fortune and honor all bound to mine.""</p>
  
  <p><strong>His sword helped taint the throne you sit on</strong>, Ned thought, but he did not permit the words to pass his lips. ""He swore a vow to protect his king's life with his own. Then he opened that king's throat with a sword.""</p>
  
  <p>""Seven hells, someone had to kill Aerys!"" Robert said, reining his mount to a sudden halt beside an ancient barrow. ""If Jaime hadn't done it, it would have been left for you or me.""</p>
  
  <p>...</p>
  
  <p>""I cannot answer for the gods, Your Grace … only for what I found when I rode into the throne room that day,"" Ned said. ""Aerys was dead on the floor, drowned in his own blood. His dragon skulls stared down from the walls. Lannister's men were everywhere. Jaime wore the white cloak of the Kingsguard over his golden armor. I can see him still. Even his sword was gilded. <strong>He was seated on the Iron Throne</strong>, high above his knights, wearing a helm fashioned in the shape of a lion's head. How he glittered!""</p>

Lannister's men drew back. I never said a word. I looked at him seated there on the throne, and I waited. <strong>At last Jaime laughed and got up.</strong> He took off his helm, and he said to me, 'Have no fear, Stark. I was only keeping it warm for our friend Robert. It's not a very comfortable seat, I'm afraid.'""</p>
  
  <p>The king threw back his head and roared. His laughter startled a flight of crows from the tall brown grass. They took to the air in a wild beating of wings.

<h3>Gregor Clegane</h3>

<p>It can be argued Ned has never really made common cause with Gregor but he has rode alongside him and been forced to put up with him due to their common allegiance with the Lannisters. Ned appeared to dislike and distrust Gregor and even put some belief into the rumours over the knight and that he was the one to kill Elia and the babes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unlike his brother, Ser Gregor did not live at court. He was a solitary man who seldom left his own lands, but for wars and tourneys. He had been with Lord Tywin when King's Landing fell, a new-made knight of seventeen years, even then distinguished by his size and his implacable ferocity. <strong>Some said it had been Gregor who'd dashed the skull of the infant prince Aegon Targaryen against a wall, and whispered that afterward he had raped the mother, the Dornish princess Elia, before putting her to the sword.</strong> These things were not said in Gregor's hearing.</p>
  
  <p>Ned Stark could not recall ever speaking to the man, though Gregor had ridden with them during Balon Greyjoy's rebellion, one knight among thousands. He watched him with disquiet. <strong>Ned seldom put much stock in gossip, but the things said of Ser Gregor were more than ominous.</strong> He was soon to be married for the third time, and one heard dark whisperings about the deaths of his first two wives. It was said that his keep was a grim place where servants disappeared unaccountably and even the dogs were afraid to enter the hall. And there had been a sister who had died young under queer circumstances, and the fire that had disfigured his brother, and the hunting accident that had killed their father. Gregor had inherited the keep, the gold, and the family estates. His younger brother Sandor had left the same day to take service with the Lannisters as a sworn sword, and it was said that he had never returned, not even to visit.</p>

<h3>Roose Bolton</h3>

<p>I am mentioning Roose here because he's mentioned in the question and there's a slim chance it his him but I highly doubt it. In fact I'm pretty sure it isn't supposed to be him.</p>

<p>The Stark's and the Bolton's have been in conflict with each other for about as long as there have been Stark's and Bolton's. So you'd assume this would be a likely candidate and the two have had to kiss and make up for Robert's Rebellion, the Greyjoy Rebellion and in most day to day running's of the North.</p>

<p>However, the only mention of Roose, or any Bolton for that matter, in eddard's chapters is the following. It's not a positive thought of Ned's though.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Mercy is never a mistake, Lord Renly,"" Ned replied. ""On the Trident, Ser Barristan here cut down a dozen good men, Robert's friends and mine. When they brought him to us, grievously wounded and near death, <strong>Roose Bolton urged us to cut his throat</strong>, but your brother said, 'I will not kill a man for loyalty, nor for fighting well,' and sent his own maester to tend Ser Barristan's wounds."" He gave the king a long cool look. ""Would that man were here today.""</p>

<hr>

<p>Rhaegar Targaryen is mentioned in the question so I'll address him here but I don't think Ned despised him. In fact most of his recollections of Rhaegar actually appear to be quite positive, for example...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There was no answer Ned Stark could give to that but a frown. For the first time in years, he found himself remembering Rhaegar Targaryen. He wondered if Rhaegar had frequented brothels; somehow he thought not.</p>
  
  <p><sup>A Game of Thrones, Eddard IX</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In fact from seeing Rhaegar give Lyanna the queen of beauty's laurel instead of his own wife and knowing about their relationship. Even going as far as to</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> look after Jon and hide him away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's likely that Ned had some respect for the man and probably didn't despise him just out of respect for Lyanna.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robert had been jesting with Jon and old Lord Hunter as the prince circled the field after unhorsing Ser Barristan in the final tilt to claim the champion's crown. Ned remembered the moment when all the smiles died, when Prince Rhaegar Targaryen urged his horse past his own wife, the Dornish princess Elia Martell, to lay the queen of beauty's laurel in Lyanna's lap. He could see it still: a crown of winter roses, blue as frost.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“But if it wasn’t the Kettleblacks and it wasn’t Ser Dontos... you weren’t even in the city, and it couldn’t have been Tyrion...”</p>
<p>“No more guesses, sweetling?”</p>
<p>She shook her head. “I don’t...”</p>
<p>Petyr smiled. “I will wager you that at some point during the evening someone told you that your hair net was crooked and straightened it for you.”</p>

<p>“Gentle, pious, good-hearted Willas Tyrell. Be grateful you were spared, he would have bored you spitless. The old woman is not boring, though, I’ll grant her that. A fearsome old harridan, and not near as frail as she pretends. When I came to Highgarden to dicker for Margaery’s hand, she let her lord son bluster while she asked pointed questions about Joffrey’s nature. I praised him to the skies, to be sure... whilst my men spread disturbing tales amongst Lord Tyrell’s servants. That is how the game is played.</p>
<p>“I also planted the notion of Ser Loras taking the white. Not that I suggested it, that would have been too crude. But men in my party supplied grisly tales about how the mob had killed Ser Preston Greenfield and raped the Lady Lollys, and slipped a few silvers to Lord Tyrell’s army of singers to sing of Ryam Redwyne, Serwyn of the Mirror Shield, and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight. A harp can be as dangerous as a sword, in the right hands.</p>
<p>“Mace Tyrell actually thought it was his own idea to make Ser Loras’s inclusion in the Kingsguard part of the marriage contract. Who better to protect his daughter than her splendid knightly brother? And it relieved him of the difficult task of trying to find lands and a bride for a third son, never easy, and doubly difficult in Ser Loras’s case.</p>
<p>“Be that as it may. Lady Olenna was not about to let Joff harm her precious darling granddaughter, but unlike her son she also realized that under all his flowers and finery, Ser Loras is as hot-tempered as Jaime Lannister. Toss Joffrey, Margaery, and Loras in a pot, and you’ve got the makings for kingslayer stew. The old woman understood something else as well. Her son was determined to make Margaery a queen, and for that he needed a king... but he did not need Joffrey. We shall have another wedding soon, wait and see. Margaery will marry Tommen. She’ll keep her queenly crown and her maidenhead, neither of which she especially wants, but what does that matter? The great western alliance will be preserved... for a time, at least.”</p>

"15616","What is Petyr Baelish's endgame with Sansa?","<p><strong>This question and related answers contain some serious spoilers from books 3 to 5. Littlefinger's <em>endgame</em> would be something only a person having read those books would understand.</strong></p>

<p>I'm re-reading ASoIaF, but I've only just finished AGoT and I'm specifically looking for evidence regarding Petyr Baelish and Sansa Stark.  I do not believe that he whisked her away to the Eyrie without some kind of plan.  I've been doing a little bit of digging around as to thoughts on Littlefinger's plans regarding Sansa.  <a href=""http://towerofthehand.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">The Tower of the Hand</a> has some interesting thoughts, but it doesn't appear that anything has been discussed since before ADWD was published.</p>

<p>I have my own thoughts.  I believe that once things settle down in the Seven Kingdoms again and it's safe to reveal Sansa's true identity, he's going to try to marry Sansa and take control of Harrenhal, Winterfell, and possibly the Vale in addition to his lordship of the Fingers.  Pretty much everyone believes that all the male Starks are dead leaving Sansa as the sole heir of Winterfell.  In addition to that, he'll get Sansa who is apparently a dead-ringer for Catelyn and go on to fulfill all his Catelyn fantasies.  </p>

<p>I'm really partial to this theory.  Can anyone shoot holes in it for me or offer up alternative theories?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","15624","<p>I think it is somewhat thin that Littlefinger should be able to secure a betrothal for his illegitimate daughter to the heir to the Eyrie. IIRC there was some explanation for that regarding money, which is a little bit weak. However...</p>

<p>dianod is correct in that Littlefinger stated his plan to Sansa in AFFC, and it is a solid plan. Not without cost, though, as it would alienate any remaining Lannisters. The gain would be considerable, as he would gain a firm hold of the north through Sansa, a somewhat less firm hold of the Vale through Harry, and a yet again somewhat less firm hold of the Riverlands through his own Lordship of Harrenhal.</p>

<p>Is it his true plan? It does seem so, but with Littlefinger, who knows. </p>

<p>Would that be his endgame? To paraphrase Littlefinger himself, to know how to move a piece, you have to know what motivates them. Littlefinger seems to be callous and egocentric, but it is implied that he is strongly motivated by his love of Catelyn. With Catelyn dead (or undead, as it turns out) he has shifted his desires to Sansa, but the question is if that is something he would have counted on in his long con. I think not.</p>

<p>Remember that this whole mess was started by him. He is literally the spider in the middle of the whole Lannister-Stark web. He made Lysa poison Jon Arryn and send a letter to Catelyn, thereby triggering all the events that lead to war. Littlefinger thrives on chaos, but I highly doubt he could have hoped to win Catelyn, even if Ned died. I somehow do not have the impression that he knew of Sansa beforehand, but rather noticed her when she came to King's Landing with Ned. So, if not love of Catelyn/Sansa, what then?</p>

<p>Is it power he lusts for? It may be. Although he was already fairly high up in power from the start: treasurer and member of the small council is perhaps one of the highest offices in Westeros. As someone (Tyrion?) said, though, <em>Why would a man with a pot of gold want another?</em> Perhaps, but I think there is more.</p>

<p>Littlefinger comes from a (somewhat) humble background, being the son of a minor lord. He is short, does not inspire love or loyalty or trust (except in Lysa, who he deceived and murdered). People (rightly) consider him sleazy and untrustworthy. His biggest love Catelyn spurned him, and he was humiliated by Brandon Stark. I believe Littlefinger wants to win and be acclaimed hero, and win the love of the people, the respect of honourable lords and the love of women (Sansa, perhaps). And also in the meantime, get some revenge on people and houses who he feels have wronged him. In short, I think he wants real love and respect.</p>

<p>It feels like a logical plan from his side. He tried to fight Brandon, but swords are not his best game. He plays the game of thrones. So he sets the kingdom up for chaos and then puts it back together again, and is (possibly) celebrated as a great hero. </p>

<p>I believe, though, that in Sansa, he will have met his match. I do not think she will be as accommodating to him as he thinks. But that's another story. It is interesting to note, however, that Sansa is not yet aware that Littlefinger betrayed Ned. She will be told by someone, I am sure, and I wonder how he will try to fix that. He should realize that this knowledge will forever alienate Sansa.</p>

<p>I also remember some people having theories on Littlefinger having some plans for Daenerys' return. By his own statement, he stopped the small council from hiring a faceless man to kill her, and also he has worked on similar goals as Varys: causing chaos, setting houses against each other. If this was the case, he would have done more for Dany than Varys and Illyrio in securing half the kingdom before she even lands. But seeing as he scarcely seems interested in Dany, or is mentioned in any such connections (unlike Varys and Illyrio), it does not seem likely. Interesting, though, and food for speculation as to what he will make of Aegon's army, and Dany when/if she comes to Westeros on Drogon's back.</p>

"223109","Why does Tywin Lannister send Tyrion to King's Landing to be Hand of the King instead of himself?","<p>I've read all of the available books in the <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> series, and I am now watching <em>Game of Thrones</em> until Season 3 Episode 2. No spoilers if you can help it.</p>

<p>One thing I don't understand is that after Joffrey beheaded Ned Stark and proves himself to be a terrible king (and his mother Cersei unable to control him), Tywin Lannister sends Tyrion to King's Landing to be Hand of the King.</p>

<p>Of course Tyrion is his son, but Tyrion is obviously not his favorite. So why doesn't Tywin just send himself to be Hand of the King, and instead, prefer to stay at the ruined castle Harrenhal?</p>

<p>Is this decision explained anywhere in the book or in the TV series?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","223111","<p>It's explained in the very episode why Tyrion was sent, because he is family, Tywin's son. And of course he can't send Jaime because he's been captured. Note both Tywin's and Tyrion's first comments in the quote below. Tywin has realised Tyrion is quite good at ruling and King's Landing needs a good ruler at the moment. Tyrion's comment about strategy is also quite telling. He himself isn't the best at it so he wouldn't make much use in battle but Tywin is.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tywin Lannister:</strong> They have my son! Get out, all of you. (to Tyrion) Not you. You were right about Eddard Stark. If he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Robert's brothers. But now – madness. Madness and stupidity. I always thought you were a stunted fool. Perhaps I was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Tyrion Lannister:</strong> Half wrong. I'm new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here.</p>
<p><strong>Tywin Lannister:</strong> No one will stay here. Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the Riverland on fire from God's Eye to the Red Fork. The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal. And you will go to King's Landing.</p>
<p><strong>Tyrion Lannister:</strong> And do what?</p>
<p><strong>Tywin Lannister:</strong> Rule. You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead. You will bring that boy king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be. And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest – Baelish, Varys, Pycelle…</p>
<p><strong>Tyrion Lannister:</strong> Heads, spikes, walls. Why not my uncle? Why not anyone? Why me?</p>
<p><strong>Tywin Lannister:</strong> You're my son.</p>
<p><sub><em>Game of Thrones</em>, Season 1 Episode 10, &quot;Fire and Blood&quot;</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's also worth noting that Tywin <em>is</em> Hand of the King at that moment in time. However, he is too busy at war to go back and lead at King's Landing. He was playing to the strengths of his family, Tyrion ruling and himself fighting and being a strategist.</p>
<p>Tyrion's thoughts on the matter are elaborated on a bit more in this scene. He sends Tyrion, and not an uncle of someone else, because Tywin has given up on Jaime. That means Tyrion is now his only son, in his head, and so he needs to rely on him more to carry on House Lannister.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;More than you know, Father,&quot; Tyrion answered quietly. He finished his wine and set the cup aside, thoughtful. A part of him was more pleased than he cared to admit. Another part was remembering the battle upriver, and wondering if he was being sent to hold the left again. &quot;Why me?&quot; he asked, cocking his head to one side. &quot;Why not my uncle? Why not Ser Addam or Ser Flement or Lord Serrett? Why not a … bigger man?&quot;</p>
<p>Lord Tywin rose abruptly. &quot;You are my son.&quot;</p>
<p>That was when he knew. You have given him up for lost, he thought. You bloody bastard, you think Jaime's good as dead, so I'm all you have left. Tyrion wanted to slap him, to spit in his face, to draw his dagger and cut the heart out of him and see if it was made of old hard gold, the way the smallfolks said. Yet he sat there, silent and still.</p>

  he came to Tarth on his leisurely lord’s progress, to mark his coming of age. Her father 
  welcomed him with a feast and commanded her to attend; elsewise she would have hidden in her

  of swords. They will know about the rose, she told Lord Selwyn, they will laugh at me. But the

  <p>And Renly Baratheon had shown her every courtesy, as if she were a proper maid, and pretty. 
  He even danced with her, and in his arms she’d felt graceful, and her feet had floated across the 
  floor. Later others begged a dance of her, because of his example. From that day forth, she 
  wanted only to be close to Lord Renly, to serve him and protect him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even after that, during <em>A Clash of Kings</em> once she joined him in his bid for the kingdom, he accepted her on her own merits, and bestowed upon her the highest honor she could have hoped for: he made her one of his own personal guards.</p>

  would be one of your seven, and pledge my life to yours, to go where you go, ride at your side, 
  and keep you safe from all hurt and harm.” </p>

  Tarth did not look unfortunate. Her smile lit up her face, and her voice was strong and proud as 
  she said, “My life for yours, Your Grace. From this day on, I am your shield, I swear it by the old

<p>Pycelle had no choice but to feed accurate information to Ned. If he lied in some way that Ned's sister-in-law could contradict, he would have outed himself as a conspirator. The only publicly known information about Jon Arryn's last days is that:</p>

<p>Second, they don't always have the time and resources to create specific animations for every minor location - thus the capital of a region is often used as a stand-in to represent the overall territory.</p>

<p>I'm not sure I understand this. Thus far Arya is concealing her true identity, claiming to be a daughter of a self-taught and educated stone mason, a commoner.</p>

<p>What does Tywin mean by what he says? Does he believe she's not a commoner, and is really of some noble birth by trying to correct her?</p>

<p>It is clear that Tywin is aware Arya is not what she appears to be. But judging from the conversation, he enjoys her intellect and her interest in what he is talking about. She is frank in her opinion and he likely does not get much frank conversation.

"155167","Why did they shoot with burning arrows during the fight for Castle Black?","<p>For the defense of Caste Black, the Night's Watch shot their foes with burning arrows. The fight was happening at night, therefore the fire made the arrows more visible in the air and what I think: easier to be dogded. A good example is Ygritte who actually evades a shot in a short scene in the series.</p>

<p>What reason would you have to shoot arrows that are burning, other than to set things on fire, which most likely was not the case, as an arrow that hits a human body would probably get its flame extinguished.</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","155170","<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>For the show it was more for the audience sake than anything, to see where they landed.</li>
<li>Fire is always a great intimidation tactic in combat, even if it offers no real decisive advantage beyond simply intimidating your enemy.</li>
<li>Flaming arrows are tracers for the archers to adjust fire when needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Flaming arrows were used in medieval battles, but not as often as tv/movies would like you to believe. The primary use was to burn towns/defenses and force the defenders to have to fight a battle on two fronts (defend against an enemy and put out spreading fires).</p>

<p>On the side of the offender ignited arrows were pretty much used as an intimidation tactic. Throughout history you can see and imagine the fear that 'fire' would bring to the battlefield. However, the arrows were typically no where near as accurate; even worse when some had a small jars, boxes, and tubes filled with oil or somethings that would break upon impact in the hopes to spread the flames across the target.</p>

<p>But the other benefit to flaming arrows at night is for the archers themselves. Flaming arrows were likely the first instance of tracer rounds. Shooting arrows during the day it fairly simple to see where they are landing, but at night they would disappear. Fire solves that problem.</p>

<p>And while it is possible the enemy would see the arrows coming and avoid them you have to remember that:
<br>1. They can see arrows during the day... did it really help?
<br>2. There are a hundred or more of them coming at you and you are likely bunched up in a formation.
<br>3. Arrows are cheap to produce and it is worth the waste if you miss; and totally worth it if you hit...
<br>4. The fact that they are shooting arrows at you means you can't hit them with a sword and you need to run from a to b while avoiding them, causing more stress/pressure/fatigue.</p>

<p>But yeah... it was pretty much so that you could see them.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>I recently started watching the Game of Thrones TV Series and enjoyed it very much. Only later did I find out that it was based on a series of books, which is good news, since I really enjoy reading. I already watched the complete first season, and am halfway through the second. What I would like to know is if there are major plot differences between the series and the books, or if, having seen the first season, I should skip the first book or something. Or if, even though there are not many differences, the book is still worth reading because it is more intense and adds more to the plot or something like this (I'm guessing this should be the right choice).</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

<p>P.S.: Don't get me wrong, I know books are almost always much better than TV Series or Movies (even though some may be very good adaptations). I just want to know the opinion of people who have both read and watched the Series.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><adaptation-comparison>","16822","<p>I have read the first 4 books a few years ago. After watching the first season (and before the second), I re-read the first 2 books.
In the first season they worked hard to keep the series as close as possible to the books. In the 2nd season, I feel that they deviated too much from the books, and altered some of the events, so the story is different in some areas. I am not talking about short-cuts that are a necessity when moving from a book to a TV series, but of more profound changes.</p>

<p>Just to name a few:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> In the books Aria never meets Tywin Lannister, and so does Littlefinger.
 John Snow's story is different from what is shown in the series.
 Osha doesn't tempt a sleep with Theon in the books.
 The whole scene with Joffery's entourage being attacked after seeing off Marcella, is different, and specifically Sansa Stark doesn't undergo an attempted rape.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In my eyes these changes (and others) are significant and alter the story and our understanding of the characters. It seems that they've made the series much more sexual (not that the books are not) to appeal to the audience.</p>

<p>In short, you can't skip the books if you want to get the whole story and all aspects of it (especially if you like reading).</p>

"16858","Why is Asshai-by-the-Shadow a dangerous place?","<p>In both the <em>Song of Ice and Fire</em> books and the TV series there are references to a mysterious land called Asshai-by-the-Shadow. In the TV series, both Ser Jorah and Quaithe (the woman with the mask) mention this place. Furthermore, in the TV episode ""A Man Without Honor"", Quaithe is shown to be covering a man in tattoos ""to protect him from the shadow"".</p>

<p>Is this merely a throw-away line, or are there any other hints (books or TV) that there is some real danger in Asshai? Is it ever explained what ""the Shadow"" is, for that matter?</p>

The second kill wasn't much better in terms of having deep thought behind it. Realizing this, Arya knew that she had to make the third kill count.

<ol>
<li><p>Because if the continent of Westeros in the show (and books) are probably set on either a parallel Earth or a very Earth-like alien world. </p></li>
<li><p>But the problem is that we find out that there are roughly forty years of winter for every ten years of summer (it could be more or less) so this planet is obviously not Earth because it must have a very different orbit to our world. It obviously takes fifty Earth years to orbit their sun and the planet is only positioned for summer for a short period of that time. </p></li>
<li><p>But we see in the opening credits that Westeros is inside the shell of a planet and at the centre is their large mechanical artificial sun, I don't think the opening credits of the show show us what is literally happening, I think it's an artists representation, so it's good to bear this point in mind but safe to ignore it. </p></li>

<p>So any ideas? </p>

<hr>

<p>I believe I have confused some people with this question, first of all the story tells us something along the lines of ""The summers last years and the winters last lifetimes!"" I'm not sure what the exact wording is, but whether the tilt of the planet or the distance from the sun or the atmosphere is responsible is irrelevant, I think we can agree that it's not Earth or at least not our version of Earth. </p>

<p>What I was hoping for was a little specific info on what this planet is for example, Lord of the Rings happens in a lost age in Europe, back when Elves, Hobbits and Dwarves shared the world with man, so we know Middle Earth, is Earth.

","<game-of-thrones>","85835","<p><strong>Short answer:</strong> they were killed through war, disease and horrible disasters.</p>

<h2>Longer answer:</h2>

<p>The 300 years of Targaryen rule has been extremely bloody. And while the people of Westeros stood no chance against the dragon riders, the Targaryens were not immune against themselves. Several incidents served to whittle down the Targaryen clan (which was never very large in the first place).</p>

<p><strong>The Dance of the Dragons</strong>: The first Targaryen civil war. When King Viserys I died, a successsion crisis erupted between his heir apparent Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half brother Aegon (the eldest male child). The Targaryens (and Westeros) were split in half and a bloody war ensued that saw <em>both</em> sides utilizing dragons. In the end Aegon II was crowned king, but not before both sides suffered great losses in both Targaryens and dragons. It was this war and it's immediate aftermath that lead to the decline of the Targaryen dragons You can read more about that war in the prequel novella <em>The Princess and the Queen</em>.</p>

<p><strong>The Blackfyre Rebellion</strong>: The second Targaryen civil war. Just before King Aegon IV died he legitimized a number of his bastards, chief among them Daemon Blackfyre. When Aegon died, many noblemen could not stomach his bookish heir Daeron II and flocked around the classically martial Daemon who claimed the Iron Throne for himself. The rebellion was quelled, but again not without serious loss of life. Heirs of Blackfyre would continue to plague Westeros, later even managing to kill King Maekar I.</p>

<p><strong>The Great Spring Sickness</strong>: A plague that ravished Westeros leaving tens of thousands of dead in its wake. Amongst the victims were King Daeron II and several Targaryens including several of the king's grandsons. </p>

<p><strong>The Tragedy of Summerhall</strong>: A mysterious event that killed several Targaryens, including King Aegon V and his heir. Fandom speculated that it was an attempt to revive dragons that went horribly wrong.</p>

  hundred obsidian daggers every year, during the Age of Heroes. The Others come when it is
  cold, most of the tales agree. Or else it gets cold when they come. Sometimes they appear during
  snowstorms and melt away when the skies clear. They hide from the light of the sun and emerge
  by night... or else night falls when they emerge. Some stories speak of them riding the corpses of
  dead animals. Bears, direwolves, mammoths, horses, it makes no matter, so long as the beast is
  dead. The one that killed Small Paul was riding a dead horse, so that part’s plainly true. Some
  accounts speak of giant ice spiders too. I don’t know what those are. Men who fall in battle
  against the Others must be burned, or else the dead will rise again as their thralls.”</p>

  <p>“The armor of the Others is proof against most ordinary blades, if the tales can be believed,”
  said Sam, “and their own swords are so cold they shatter steel. Fire will dismay them, though,
  and they are vulnerable to obsidian.” He remembered the one he had faced in the haunted forest,
  and how it had seemed to melt away when he stabbed it with the dragonglass dagger Jon had
  made for him. “I found one account of the Long Night that spoke of <strong><em>the last hero slaying Others

<p>The creature is seemingly a very effective assassin. So why don't they create more of them (or make the one that already exists) kill other of enemies Stannis' like King Joffrey?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","17455","<p>Well, first off, they will use more shadows, so your question is premature. Not quite sure if that should be in a spoiler tag or not. I assume this is a question regarding the TV-show, and not the books.</p>

<p>Secondly, the shadows are costly to summon. Later on in the books, it is mentioned that Stannis seems drained and skeletal, and there are also other references, which I will not post here for their very spolerific nature. But suffice to say, it concerns people getting hurt to fuel Melisandre's magic.</p>

<p>Also, as we shall see, the shadows will not help Stannis as much as he would hope, because the majority of the lords and people are against him. So, combined with their high cost, they do not provide a real answer to his problems.</p>

<p>Besides those reasons, I think Stannis is a good guy, deep down inside. At first, I did not like him at all, but throughout the books, he is solid, honourable, harsh and grumpy, and it is hard not to like him when he scorns and scolds his sycophants, but praises Davos for telling the truth.</p>

<p>All he does, he does for a reason, not for personal greed or ambition, but because it is right and just. Yes, I admit, I am a bit of a fan of Stannis. So, I am siding with Andres F and also saying that Stannis is not quite comfortable with it. He admits at one point that it is better to kill one man dishonourably, than to allow thousands to suffer, but I think it does not sit well with him just the same.</p>

"155745","Is Cersei Lying to Cat about Cersei's First Born?","<p>Maggy the Frog's <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Maggy#Prophecies"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">prophecy</a> of Cersei having and losing three children seems to be right on the money but for one thing:</p>

<p><em>Either Cersei is lying to Cat in the 2nd episode about the ""little black-haired beauty"" who died in infancy, or Maggy was (wrong?)</em></p>

<p>The ""You win or you die"" scene in the eponymous episode (Season 1 episode 7) doesn't provide any hints. Cersei cops to all of her living children being Jaimie's, but neither confirms nor denies any dead children between her and Robert.</p>

<p>My best guess is that since it was Robert's custom to be away on a hunt during his wife's childbirth, Cersei killed the (born living) baby shortly after the birth. But that's just a guess since that would make her statements to Cat technically true, without entirely conflicting with Maggy's prophecy (Cersei felt no loss, and perhaps the baby wore no gold shroud).</p>

<p>I'm pretty certain that there haven't been any more hints in the show (see my new answer below for a correction on this). But I've only read about halfway through the books so far, and it's been a while. I easily could have missed something in what I have read.</p>

<p>So, any clues in the books that aren't in the show? Do the books tell more of the <em>""black-haired beauty""</em>?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","155807","<p>To complement Kevin's answer:</p>

<p>The whole conversation, as Kevin said, is a show-only thing. Cersei never gave birth to any child who may have been Robert's. </p>

<p>Eddard wondered the same, how did Cersei and Robert never have any Children?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""A dozen years,"" Ned said. ""<strong>How is it that you have had no children
  by the king?</strong>""</p>
  
  <p>She lifted her head, defiant. ""<strong>Your Robert got me with child
  once</strong>,"" she said, her voice thick with contempt. ""<strong>My brother found
  a woman to cleanse me. He never knew</strong>. If truth be told, I can
  scarcely bear for him to touch me, and I have not let him inside me
  for years. <strong>I know other ways to pleasure him, when he leaves his
  whores long enough to stagger up to my bedchamber</strong>. Whatever we do,
  <strong>the king is usually so drunk that he's forgotten it all by the next morning.</strong>""<br><sub><strong><em>AGOT: Eddard XII</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So as evident by Cersei's own confession:</p>

<ol>
<li>Robert only once managed to impregnate Cersei. </li>
<li>Cersei aborted the child with help of Jaime.</li>
<li>Robert never knew about this whole conception and abortion of his child. </li>
<li>Cersei employed other ways than intercourse to sate Robert.</li>
<li>Robert was usually too drunk to remember if he actually managed to have intercourse with his Queen or not. </li>
</ol>

<p>Later Cersei also thinks the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Ten thousand of your children perished in my palm</strong>, Your Grace, she thought, slipping a third finger into Myr. Whilst you snored, <strong>I
  would lick your sons off my face and fingers</strong> one by one, all those
  pale sticky princes. You claimed your rights, my lord, but <strong>in the
  darkness I would eat your heirs</strong>. <br><sub><strong><em>AFFC: Cersei
  VII</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Cersei says, She often used her hands and her mouth to get Robert off her case instead of letting him have intercourse with her. Due to these <em>methods</em> she never actually got pregnant with Robert's children except that one time, when she got it aborted. </p>

<p>So in conclusion, no there is no indication in the books about some Ravenhead kid who died after his birth. Only Children Cersei ever bore were Jaime's. Seems to be one of the many internal inconsistencies of the show.  </p>

"86209","Why didn't the army Mance Rayder assembled sail south around The Wall?","<p>According to <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/86197/20393"">this answer</a>, Stannis' army sailed north around The Wall.</p>

<p>I've attached the image from the answer below.</p>

<p>Why didn't The Wildlings just sail south around The Wall the same way Stannis sailed north around it?</p>

<p>They lived in / amongst massive forests so they had no shortage of material to construct sips with.</p>

<p>Is it ever explained in canon?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/txf8u.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>
","<game-of-thrones>","86219","<p>The wildlings didn't exactly have much knowledge of what went on south of the wall. Whilst there were people like Mance who used to be a crow, he was very unlikely to be highborn, so wouldn't have much knowledge of the North's war capabilities.</p>

<p>They had no spies in enemy camps to be able to track troop movements, or any idea of the numbers of men other armies may have.</p>

<p>This means they have no idea what they would be sailing into. The northmen could have had fleets of ships to stop them before they got anywhere near land for all they knew. Remember, Jon managed to convince them that 1000 men manned Castle Black, when in reality it was less than 200.</p>

<p>So they would not have risked a small strike force (like the one that Ygritte and Jon were a part of) traveling that way, never mind a full army (hence why they went over the top of the wall).</p>

<p>This is besides the rest of the issues:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>They had no skilled shipbuilders, sailors, harbour to build ships and get them south of the wall. They can probably build rafts and small vessels, but whilst the wood was lucrative, they wouldn't have had nearly the resources or expertise to make a fleet able to transport the number of troops they had.</p></li>
<li><p>If they had landed in the North or South in large numbers, the people living there would have fought back (rather than just the Night's Watch).</p></li>
<li><p>They were unorganized, any decent army could have flattened them in the field (as Stannis proved) and they could have not have laid siege to a castle for very long.</p></li>
<li><p>After capturing Castle Black, they would have had a half-decent fortification to defend themselves from anyone trying to send them back north of the wall, as well as control of the wall itself.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The only defensive strategy of the wildlings was their sheer numbers. They knew the Night's Watch were not an army, they were glorified guardsmen. Whilst they were more regimented than wildlings, they didn't have any chance of beating the wildlings in open combat.</p>

<p>The wildling's only hope was to oust the Night's Watch from Castle Black and take it for themselves. And it would have worked too, if it wasn't for that meddling Stannis.</p>

<p>He's also drowning in a sea of wine. He most definitely is not in the right mind, nor is he himself.</p>

<p>Whether or not <strong>Varys</strong> and <strong>Illyrio</strong> (Vallyrio) trust him when he his sober, is irrelevant, since <strong>Tyrion</strong> is not going to be of much help, let alone be trustworthy in his drunken stupor.</p>

<p>Once on his way, he slowly discovers that people aren't who they say they are and other mysteries, such as:</p>

<p>aaaaaaaand he's hooked!</p>

<p><strong>It's the journey, not the destination</strong><br>

"86296","Who supported the Targaryens during Robert's Rebellion?","<p>In <em>A Game Of Thrones</em> (I think, it may be one of the later books), Robert's Rebellion is briefly recapped and it is said that when Robert won, he stripped lands from those who opposed his claim during the rebellion.</p>

<p>In addition, there was the epic battle at the Trident where Rhaegar was killed by Robert.</p>

<p>Does it ever address in the books who supported the Targaryens during the war?</p>

<p>We know that the Vale (House Arryn), the Riverlands (House Tully) and the North (House Stark) supported the Stormlands (House Baratheon) in the rebellion, so from the seven kingdoms there are only the Westerlands (House Lannister), Highgarden (House Tyrell) and Dorne (House Martell) remaining.</p>

<hr>

<p>The rest here is not based on memory so let me know if it's incorrect.</p>

<p>From what I gathered, the Westerlands pretty much kept out of the war. They covertly supported the Throne (which is how Tywin managed to gain access to King's Landing when it was sacked), but I don't think they ever openly opposed the Rebellion in battle.</p>

<p>Dorne probably supported the Throne because Elia was married to Rhaegar at the time.</p>

<p>How about Highgarden? Was this ever addressed? Or did the Targaryens hire mercenaries (like the Golden Company or the Second Sons) to fight on their behalf?</p>

<p>It seems like 4 houses going up against 2 wouldn't be much of a battle. Obviously Robert won, but I assumed it was a close contest.</p>

<p>The fan speculation that Jaqen is Syrio Forel is based mostly on wishful thinking, as there is no evidence of that, other than the fact that Syrio might have been captured and Jaqen appears in the black cells at around the same time. And also because he knew Arya's real identity. But like I said above, I believe Jaqen was already in the dungeons when Ned was Hand.</p>

This is likely a faceless man, sent by Euron Greyjoy to push Balon off the bridge described in an early Theon chapter. But I find it unlikely that it would be Jaqen.</p>

<p>I also highly doubt that Jaqen got himself thrown in the black cells on purpose. It is hard to assassinate people while locked up and in chains. A reasonable theory is that he was caught during a mission.</p>

<p>The observant readers will notice that Jaqen's story continues in the books. </p>

<p>It's suggested the Night's King and his Queen made sacrifices to the Others, which sounds very reminiscent of Craster. We're never told who was sacrificed or how, maybe it was NK's own children, this might even explain the Night's Watch vow to sire no children. His castle was the Nightfort, which has a creepy magical Weirwood door called the Black Gate beneath it. This gate leads to North of the Wall, very useful for carrying babies beyond the Wall's protections, and when you pass through it the door's mouth grows until it swallows, almost like you're being consumed by the Old Gods. </p>

<p>It's possible this practice of sacrificing to the Others was passed down through the generations. There is some suggestion that the knowledge of sacrificing to the Others exists on the periphery of Northern society. The Wildlings seem to think Others steal their children and a common insult in the North is ""The Other's take you"". If this was a common practice which is dying out now that Mance has unified the Wildlings and made them stronger, that might explain why the Others have returned. If they need the children of men to convert in order to exist, and they're now only getting a handful from Craster, perhaps they're taking a more direct approach. </p>

<p>Alternatively, it's possible that the practice was only recently rediscovered, which might also explain the Others' return. There is some suggestion that Craster is a descendant of the original pairing of Night's King and Queen. People say of him that he has black blood and has a cold smell to him and that he appears less than human. If Craster has the blood of the Others then this might also explain his incest, as a means of purifying that blood for them, of not diluting it (a parallel to the Targaryen practice of incest, also intended for the same purpose).</p>

<p>His name might also have originally come from a mangled form of ""Stark"", like the Karstarks, and since there's a non-zero possibility that the original Night's King was also a Stark, perhaps the name passed down and eventually became Craster. If Craster is really a descendant of this pairing then him knowing of the sacrifices or working it out by some piece of familial knowledge passed down through the generations may explain how he came to be sacrificing his children.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Gilly's baby is nicknamed ""Monster"" in the novels, which might be foreshadowing if the baby has the blood of the Others. Especially since the baby is at the Wall and everyone believes it to be the child of Mance, King in the North. Melisandre is also at the Wall. I'm not sure the Others will be too happy if one of their blood kin was sacrificed as an offering to R'hllor.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Sandor Clegane (The Hound) promptly quit the battlefield in the middle of the battle.</p>

<p>I thought he was the kind of brute who would enjoy such battle. Why does he do that? </p>
","<game-of-thrones>","17893","<p>You may have noticed the scarring on The Hound's face, they talk about it in season 1 of the series and in the first book as well. He was burned by his brother (The Mountain) after taking a toy. Ever since the only thing he has feared is fire.</p>

<p>The reason he abandons the battlefield is due to the fires; he is afraid.</p>

<p>Here is the quote when The Hound talks to Sansa about his face from <em>Game of Thrones</em>(emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I'll tell you what it was, girl,"" he
  said, a voice from the night, a shadow leaning so close now that she could smell the sour stench of wine
  on his breath. ""I was younger than you, six, maybe seven. A woodcarver set up shop in the village under
  my father's keep, and to buy favor he sent us gifts. The old man made marvelous toys. I don't remember
  what I got, but it was Gregor's gift I wanted. A wooden knight, all painted up, every joint pegged
  separate and fixed with strings, so you could make him fight. Gregor is five years older than me, the toy
  was nothing to him, he was already a squire, near six foot tall and muscled like an ox. So I took his
  knight, but there was no joy to it, I tell you. I was scared all the while, and true enough, he found me.
  There was a brazier in the room. Gregor never said a word, just picked me up under his arm and <strong>shoved
  the side of my face down in the burning coals and held me there while I screamed and screamed</strong>. You
  saw how strong he is. Even then, it took three grown men to drag him off me. The septons preach about
  the seven hells. What do they know? <strong>Only a man who's been burned knows what hell is truly like.</strong></p>

"86558","Do minor houses serve Great Houses?","<p>My understanding is that Noble houses such as house Umber, serve the Starks, in times of war, and aid them through taxes.</p>

<p>There are several minor houses that serve the Umbers. </p>

<p>Do these smaller houses serve Great Houses directly, or do the Umbers collect tithes and taxes from these minor houses and The Umbers in turn give it to the Starks?</p>

<p>If anything I've said is wrong, I'd love to be corrected. </p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","86584","<p>Westeros is a feudal kingdom. Which means it consists of a hierarchy of different noble houses serving the one senior to it, and all serving the Crown.</p>

<p>A <strong>Great House</strong> is one that is answerable <em>only</em> to the Crown. There are no noble houses senior to it. In essence, they are mini kingdoms. In Westeros, at the beginning of the series, the Great Houses are: </p>

<ul>
<li>House Stark of the North </li>
<li>House Baratheon of the Stormlands</li>
<li>House Lannister of the Westerlands </li>
<li>House Tully of the Riverlands </li>
<li>House Arryn of the Vale </li>
<li>House Greyjoy of the Iron Islands </li>
<li>House Tyrell of the Reach</li>
<li>House Martell of Dorne</li>
</ul>

<p>Under a Great House you have several <strong>Noble Houses</strong> serving them. They pay taxes, supply military aid in times of need, and submit to the authority of it's Great House. A Noble House is simply a noble family that has, more or less, full control of its territory and commands the allegiance of its inhabitants. Depending on it's size, a Noble House might have several lesser lords serving the more senior lord. For instance, House Royce (a vassal of House Arryn of the Vale) has two branches: House Royce of the Runestone, which is the senior branch, and House Royce of the Gates, which is a less senior cadet offshoot of the main branch. Sometimes, enough time passes that the cadet branch becomes it's own house. For instance House Karstark started out as a cadet branch of House Stark, known as the Starks of Karhold. With time Karhold Starks became Karstarks.</p>

<p>Under a Noble House you can have several <strong>Knightly Houses</strong>. Those are Knights who have also been granted land (along with its accompanying peasants) as reward for good service. In essence they are proto-Noble Houses, not big enough to have vassals of its own and do not have the authority to serve justice or arbitrate and must submit to its lord in those cases. For instance, House Clegane is a knightly house that swears fealty to House Lannister. </p>

<h3>Westerosi</h3>
<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Common_Tongue"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>Common Tongue</strong></a>: This language developed/took hold<sup>1</sup> after the Andal invasion of Westeros. Andal bands coming from Andalos in Essos repeatedly attacked Westerosi realms of the first men, carving out their own Kingdoms. Eventually the only place where the First Men retained their religion, customs and sovreignity was the Kingdom of the North. In the aftermath, The Common tongue developed which was adopted by North as well at a certain point. The accents can differ from North to Dorne, to the point that it is possible to discern the homeland of a person from his accent.</p>
<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Old_Tongue"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>Old Tongue:</strong></a> This was the original language of Westeros spoken by Giants and the First Men. Eventually with the Andal invasion, the old tongue started dying out in Westeros. Today it is spoken only beyond the wall by some Wildling clans such as Thenns or Giants.</p>
<h3>Essosi</h3>
<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/High_Valyrian"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>High Valyrian:</strong></a> This was the language of the Dragonlords of Valyrian Freehold. With the rapid expansion of Freehold and establishment of Colonies, different dialects such as Bravosi, Lysene, Lorathi, Myrish, Norvoshi, Pentoshi, Qohorik, Volantenese and Tyroshi developed overtime in the Colonies. By extension, one can say that Vulgar Ghiscari and its dialects can be considered to be dialects of High Valyrian. Furthermore, as Elyria, Tolos and Mantarys were founded by Valyrians as well, they can also be considered part of Valyrian family. The High Valyrian can be considered the Planetosi equivalent of Latin or Persian in our world. With the Doom of Valyria however, the language started going out of common usage and is today alive only in literary circles.</p>
<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Old_Ghiscari"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>Old Ghiscari:</strong></a> This was the language of ancient Ghiscari Empire which vied with the nascent Valyrian Empire for supremacy in the earliest days of mankind. Ghiscari Empire was overwhelmed by the Valyrians and as the state ceased to exist, the language started going out of use as well due to prevalence of Valyrian language.</p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/High_Valyrian#Slaver_Cities"" rel=""noreferrer"">Vulgar Ghiscari:</a></strong> This bastard tongue originated in occupied lands of former Ghiscari Empire which can be compared to <a href=""https://history.stackexchange.com/questions/28999/why-are-the-german-and-french-languages-so-different/29000#29000"">rise of modern day French from Vulgar Latin</a> which was a blend of Latin with old Celtic Gaulic language.

"156382","Who is lord of the Dreadfort?","<p>In the Tv show Sansa is married to the Bolton bastard son (Ramsay) who gets legitimised by a decree of the King. Ramsay then kills his father and ""becomes"" lord of Dreadfort. That same ""bastard"" (Ramsay) then gets killed. He has no heirs so is Sansa now the Lady of Dreadfort?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><laws>","156385","<p>This is simply unknown as of now. </p>

<p>Lord Ramsay Bolton left no living children or siblings. His Father Roose Bolton is not known to have any immediate kins either. Therefore it is unclear whether a Bolton claimant exists. Even if a Bolton claimant exists, why should they be granted Dreadfort? House Bolton is guilty of treason against the North and House Stark. Starks have every right to revoke their titles as their liege lords. But then again, only the senior line of House Bolton is guilty of treason and no longer exists in any case. It is possible for the Starks to be merciful and diminish their role from powerful vassals to small Lords or Northern equivalent of Landed Knights just like Robert did with House Connington where he demoted them to Landed knights but granted the family seat to younger line of the House. But it must be noted here that while the Senior line of House Connington fought for Targaryens, the younger line redeemed themselves by fighting for the Rebels in Robert's Rebellion. That is not the case with the younger Bolton lines, if any exist.</p>

<p>If we take example of the books, that Shall be decided by the Overlord of Dreadfort, that who becomes the new Lord or Lady based on different claims. That Person is Jon. Precedent here would be the Succession Crisis of House Hornwood (Never happened in the show), it was to be decided by Robb Stark. </p>

<p>But since this is about Show heresy, anything is possible. </p>

<p>If we look at Show-precedent:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>  1. Olenna Tyrell becomes de-facto Lady of High Garden due to her marriage to Lord Luthor Tyrell and death of all her Children and Grand
 Children, therefore wiping out senior line of House Tyrell. Olenna
 Tyrell (nee Redwyne) then became de-facto Lady of the Reach. <br><br>
  2. Cersei Lannister claimed the throne once her <em>Baratheon Children</em> had died even though her only relation to Royals was based on her marriage to Robert.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if they can use marital ties to claim a title, So can Sansa. </p>
"
"225628","Did Cersei intend for her son, King Tommen, to die?","<p>In Season 6 Episode we see that Cersei</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> blows up the Sept of Baelor, killing high Septons, quite a handful of Tyrell families and virtually all her known political enemies. Cersei also prevents her son, King Tommen from going to Sept of Baelor for obvious reason. There is a good reason to think that King Tommen is under house arrest, judging from the appearance of Gregor Clegane blocking King Tommen from going out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Upon hearing the news, King Tommen</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> throws himself out of the window and commits suicide.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this the outcome Cersei wants? Lest you think the answer is an obvious NO, I would like to offer the following counterpoint:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Tommen is getting out of control, and being clearly manipulated by High Septons. His presence is a threat to Cersei's freedom and even life, not to mention her political ambition.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And not only that,</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Cersei is seen as not crying when seeing her son body.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So could it be that by doing the above, Cersei forces or at least encourages King Tommen to make that decision?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","225649","<p>That would be a pretty radical departure from her character in both the books and the show. Cersei is shown to be utterly devoted to her children, and crushed by the deaths of Myrcella and Joffrey (who if anything, was even harder to control than Tommen).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CERSEI: You may never love the king, but you will love his children.</p>
  
  <p>SANSA: I love His Grace with all my heart.</p>
  
  <p>CERSEI: That's so very touching to hear. Permit me to share some
  womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. The more people you
  love, the weaker you are. You'll do things for them that you know you
  shouldn't do. You'll act the fool to make them happy, to keep them
  safe. Love no one but your children. On that front, a mother has no
  choice. (Season Two, ""A Man Without Honor"")</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You're correct that Cersei does not mourn Tommen's death, but in the Season Seven premiere it's revealed she's harboring resentment against Tommen for his suicide and she does indeed love him.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>JAIME: We never talked about Tommen.</p>
  
  <p>CERSEI: There's nothing to say.</p>
  
  <p>JAIME: Our baby boy killed himself.</p>
  
  <p>CERSEI: He betrayed me. He betrayed us both. Should we spend our days
  mourning the dead--mother, father, and all our children?</p>
  
  <p>JAIME: Cersei--</p>
  
  <p>CERSEI: I loved them. I did. But they're ashes now and we're still
  flesh and blood. We're the last Lannisters, the last ones who count.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess she could be lying here, but if Cersei wanted Tommen dead, why wouldn't she have just allowed him to go to the Sept? Why wouldn't the writers have fully conveyed such a dark and meaningful character moment? The simpler explanation by far is that Cersei wanted Tommen alive, and than suffered a psychotic break/survivor's guilt once he was dead.</p>

"18518","Why didn't Sansa leave with the Hound?","<p>In the HBO TV series Game of Thrones episode Blackwater, the Hound offered to take Sansa to Winterfell. The ending of the scene was ambiguous and I thought she left King's Landing with the Hound. However, in the next episode she's still in King's Landing. Perhaps in the books there is a better description of events, but I do not think they explained Sansa's thought process very well in the TV series.</p>

<p>In the episode Sansa is under the impression that the city had fallen to Stannis Baratheon's forces. King Joffrey made her suffer in previous episodes, and during the Battle of Blackwater, no one was watching Sansa and she had an opportunity to escape. Why did Sansa stay in King's Landing after all she endured? </p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><game-of-thrones>","18762","<p>I have read the books and seen the series. Here's my take:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the book, Clegane is <em>in her bed drunk, crying, and covered in blood</em>. Not a great scene for a teen to walk into. And he didn't expect her to be there.  She's supposed to be hiding in Maegor's Holdfast. He went there to experience what <em>he</em> thinks is his last time to ""be"" with her.</p>

<p>He also grabs her quite violently, throws her on the bed, and holds a knife to her throat and MAKES her sing a song to him. If you read the tale behind the song, it's relevant. The Florian and the Jonquil. He does <em>not</em> kiss her. at all. Sansa recollects later that he kissed her - she is an unreliable narrator, and still has a <em>lot</em> of evolving to do.</p>

<p>That scene alone would have scared <em>anyone</em> out of going with him.  </p></li>
<li><p>Outside the window, <em>wildfire is raging</em>. Sansa sees that. It's terrifying.  </p></li>
<li><p>She thinks Stannis has won - she has always thought if he won, <em>barring Ser Ilyn beheading her</em>, that she will be safe. But hey, Stannis is one mean son of a gun and determined.</p></li>
<li><p>In the end, Sansa decides better the devil I know than the one I don't, which is escaping and hitting the road to who knows where<sup>*</sup>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And to clarify something if you have read book three, and I won't give spoilers here: what The Hound says about Sansa, although brutish, is done to incite another to kill him. He would <em>never</em> have done what he says he wished he had done. And besides, it was to keep her out of the hands of the Lannisters anyway, whom he despises.</p>

</ul>

<p>There might be more, but I can't find anything about them on the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jaime_Lannister"" rel=""noreferrer"">wiki</a>.</p>

<p>He might have won a tourney melée or two in his youth, but from what I can tell most of the better knights joust, so I doubt he would have bested anyone noteworthy in a sword fight during a tourney.</p>

<p>And he was only given the position of Kingsguard by Aerys because he wanted to make sure that Tywin's heir couldn't inherit his lands.</p>

<p>Every other scenario I can think of that he has fought in throughout the timeline of the books/tv show have been in a group, like the Battle of the Whispering Wood and when he attempted to escape from Riverrun (books).</p>

<p>Of course, now that he has lost his right hand it is likely that he will never be good again, but with his left hand he can't even compete with Ser Ilyn Payne/Bronn.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that Jaime was <em>good</em>, as he is an heir of one of the greater houses, so would have had the best training, but where did he gain this fearsome reputation of being one of the best? Was it simply because he became a Kingsguard so young?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Thanks to the comment of <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/25675/nika-g"">Nika G</a> for pointing out the feats of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Barristan_Selmy#Entry_in_the_White_Book"" rel=""noreferrer"">Barristan the Bold</a>, this is the exact kind of thing I'm looking for.</p>

<p>There's not much in the White Book about Jaime, and that's kind of what I mean. Whilst he has shown his bravery (protecting Brienne from being killed) and ferocity (trying to kill Robb after he had already lost the Battle of the Whispering Wood), we haven't had much proof of his supposed legendary <em>skill</em>.</p>

<p>I don't doubt that Jaime is actually a <em>good</em> swordsman, he has cut down knights left, right and center. But they were all less experienced/not as well trained, that's nothing more than many others have done. People like Ned Stark, Jon Snow &amp; Stannis Baratheon are all considered <em>good</em> swordsmen, but none of them are called the best.</p>

<p>I'm saying that Jaime hasn't done much to claim the mantle of the <em>best</em> (or one of) other than being appointed the youngest Kingsguard in history, which he didn't get on battle merits alone. I'm asking if his reputation might have originated from somewhere other than that, or if people had given him this accolade simply from seeing him fight (like Barristan Selmy).</p>

"87706","What's the big deal with the Tyrells controlling Westeros?","<p>So it's been a few years since I last read the books, but watching the television show has made me think about the overall story once again. Generic spoilers to follow.</p>

<p>A big theme in the book is that things are getting ""worse"" for the people of Westeros (this is echoed in the sentiments of one of the series' few savvy master manipulators: Varys). This isn't a big surprise, as it's common to give a ""build-up"" to the climax. In Game of Thrones (TV-Show), this means that:</p>

<ul>
<li>The kingdom is splintering,</li>
<li>Debt to the Iron Bank of Braavos is mounting, and </li>
<li>Various cells within and without the kingdom are generally becoming less content with the ruling party.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, at the beginning, things weren't all that bad; there was relative peace in the kingdom - even though the leadership (King Robert) was a bit apathetic. After his death, things are tense, but under control... and then Ned's death sets off a massive civil war. The North just wants to be free, Renly just wants to be a king cause it's cool, and Stannis wants to be king because *that's how inheritance <em>actually</em> works, Renly.*</p>

<p>After <strong>a lot</strong> of bad stuff happens, things eventually calm down. The North's rebellion is effectively suppressed, Renly is dead, Stannis has lost the vast majority of his military power, Joffrey has choked on his reign of terror, the Lannister's strongest personalities are dead (Tywin) or gone (Tyrion), Myrcella's presence is soothing Dorne, and the Throne has been stabilized by the wealth and power of the Tyrell house.</p>

<p>So why is Varys officially giving up on the Seven Kingdoms? Kevan Lannister, a man who could <em>only</em> help stabilize the kingdom is intentionally killed. Varys claims to serve the people of Westeros, yet he's turning his back on it as soon as things have a chance to be the best they've ever been. To illustrate:</p>

<ul>
<li>Margaery is strongly implied to be the power behind the Throne, and has demonstrated herself to act with the social cunning and political skills of anyone in King's Landing, without the trappings of insanity that most of them have. She's shown herself to be far more generous and well-liked than her predecessor, Cersei, in only a few years. </li>
<li>House Tyrell has just overshadowed the Lannisters - the previous ruling party - which would pacify the North as well as Dorne. </li>
<li>Let's not forget too, that the last Targaryen whom Varys saw was the one who is universally recognized as a monster and tyrant. </li>
</ul>

<p>Things are great now, yet Varys - the man I identify as the voice of many of the readers' sentiments - has officially abandoned it.  </p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","87710","<p>From what we know, Varys might simply be a <em>loyalist</em>.<br>
He might be totally loyal to the House Targaryen and when he says he has the best interest of the Seven Kingdoms at heart, he might not be lying. He might simply think that the Targaryens are the only truly worthy rulers.  </p>

<p>You should not forget that while Aerys was a madman there were many other Targaryens who were good leaders. The dynasty remained in power for over three centuries. And while dragons surely played a role in securing their rule, the Seven Kingdoms would not have put up with them if all of them would have been crazy or bloodthirsty.<br>
The Targaryens made the Seven Kingdoms and Aerys son Rhaegar was well loved. People were probably looking forward to him taking the throne. 
So Aerys is not the <em>last</em> Targaryen Varys has seen. He knows that they can do much better than the last king.  </p>

<p>Daenerys is showing particular promise. While she's still young and learning she is also pretty moderate and seems to be a rather fair ruler. The fact that she brought dragons back into the world is probably also seen as a sign by many that she is destined to be a great leader.<br>
Daenerys is told several times that if she were to return to Westeros, a number of people would rally to her banner. So Targaryen loyalist apparently still exist in Westeros and Varys might be one of them. Already working towards the return of a Targaryen to the throne from behind the curtains.  </p>

<p>Of course it could also be ambition. He apparently did all he could to protect Aerys and warned him especially about Tywin Lannister - who then turned on his king exactly as Vayrs had said he would. And then he did all he could to keep the last survivors of House Targaryen alive and give them a chance to reclaim their birthright.  </p>

<p>This would also guarantee him a place in the history books as the kingmaker who returned the rightful rulers to the Iron Throne and brought peace to the kingdoms. He might also become the secret power behind the throne. But who knows what secret ambitions he really has.<br>
Of course he would not want to see all he's worked for be for nothing, even if an acceptable alternative for peace in the kingdoms has already presented itself.</p>

<p>I suspect it's actually a mixture of both, his loyalty and ambition that keeps him following the path he's chosen for himself. For better or worse.</p>
"
"87746","What is the surname of Brienne?","<p>I realize that this seems like a ridiculous question, because Brienne's father is Lord Selwyn Tarth, and as his daughter she will be known as Brienne Tarth.</p>

<p>But in every single reference I have found to her she is known as Brienne <strong>of</strong> Tarth. Even searching on the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Brienne_of_Tarth"">wiki</a> for Brienne Tarth redirected me to Brienne of Tarth.</p>

<p>This makes no sense. I know that the island that she was born on is called Tarth, which I'm assuming is where her family name comes from, so this title makes sense (like <em>Sansa of Winterfell</em> for example). But why is the <strong>of</strong> <em>always</em> included?</p>

<p>She is the heir to Evenfall Hall, so she does by all accounts hold the name (she isn't a bastard), so why is she never referred to as Brienne Tarth? Is this even her name?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","87753","<p>Brienne is a character of unique circumstances within the world of ASoIaF. She is the daughter of a noble house, true, but is also trying to distance herself from that nobility. In addition, she is AFAIK the only example of a female knight in Westeros. These two factors together make her identity and naming somewhat unusual.</p>

<p>On the one hand, you are correct - her surname, as member of a minor house, is ""Brienne Tarth"". However, she seems to prefer being known as simply a knight from the island of Tarth. Under those circumstances, the name ""Brienne of Tarth"" would be more appropriate.</p>

<p>Brienne's father, Lord Selwyn Tarth, has also been known to use ""Lord Selwyn of Tarth"", so Brienne may also have chosen her name with that in mind. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Since Brienne has not been formally knighted, she is unable to use the formal title of <strong><em>Ser</em></strong>, assuming that <strong><em>Ser</em></strong> would even apply to a woman. Despite this, she identifies herself as a knight and lives her life accordingly.</p>

"19910","Why is Cersei commonly referred to as ""Cersei Lannister"" instead of ""Cersei Baratheon""?","<p>I've watched the first two seasons of the TV series, and I'm in the middle of the first book. While reading, I noticed that Catelyn is usually referred to by her married name:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Scarlet-tinged spittle flew from the fat innkeep's mouth as she begged of <strong>Catelyn Stark</strong>, ""Don't kill him here!""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Her maiden name is only used in the past tense:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I <strong>was</strong> still <strong>Catelyn Tully</strong> the last time I bedded here,"" she told the innkeep.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same seems to be true for Lysa Arryn (can't find an example right now) and other married ladies. Yet, the book calls the queen by her maiden name:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Cersei Lannister</strong> entered behind him, a jeweled tiara in her hair.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there an in-world explanation for that? Are the ""naming rules"" different for the royal couple?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><game-of-thrones>","19928","<p>I don't know that we've ever had a formal description of the Westeros rules for styling and naming, but it seems to be based heavily on medieval European customs. In that case, it would make sense for Cersei to retain her name, as she married into royalty.</p>

<p>Of course, the real-world naming and marriage customs are complex, vary from culture to culture, and change frequently. Things get even more convoluted when you add in the inheritance of the crown. But in general, most medieval European cultures followed rules that were similar to the following:</p>

<p>When a woman marries into a titled family (the only people that had proper ""last names""), she takes on her husbands name. This is because she is leaving her old family (where she was of her father's house) and joining a new one (her husbands house.) Formally, they would be styled ""Lady Catelyn, of House Stark"", just like Ned is ""Lord Eddard of House Stark"", but in everyday usage they would be Ned and Catelyn Stark.</p>

<p>(In practice, the rules here vary a lot based on the situation. The Westeros example given in a previous comment had Genna, a Lannister, marrying a Frey. Depending on the current relative social/political standing of those two houses, she may choose to maintain her father's house name in common speech, though she would still be Genna, <em>nee</em> Lannister, of House Frey.)</p>

<p>When the man is royalty, however, the rules are different. A woman cannot <em>become</em> royalty by marrying into it, in the sense that they do not gain all of the privileges that a royal name has. Specifically, a woman who marries a king/prince cannot become Queen in her own right -- her <em>daughters</em> can, but she cannot. As such, while she becomes a member of the royal house, she doesn't ""take on"" her husbands name.</p>

<p>If you look back through English history, we can see plenty of examples of this convention. In particular, ASoIaF is based roughly on the historical War of the Roses,  which saw the Henry Tudor become the first Tudor king. Henry VII's son, the famous Henry VIII, would also have been named Henry Tudor, but his wives are still referred to as Catherine of Aragon, or Anne Boleyn. In modern England, woman who marry into royalty don't actually use a surname; e.g. Catherine Middleton now simply Catherine, <em>nee</em> Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge, since her husband is, among other things, the Duke of Cambridge. But, in informal conversation, and even in some media outlets, she is still often (incorrectly - see below) called ""Kate Middleton"", likely as a throwback to the historical naming convention.</p>

<p>In this sense, we can imagine that Cersei's full legal name while Robert was alive might be something like Her Majesty, Cersei <em>nee</em> Lannister, of House Baratheon, Queen of the Seven Kingdoms -- shortened to Queen Cersei Lannister.</p>

<p>I don't remember much about the other queens we've seen, or heard about, on-screen thus far but I think they fit this pattern. Stannis' wife, by this custom, would not take the Baratheon name as it was the current royal family when she married, and I only remember ever hearing her named as ""Lady Selyse"" or ""Selyse Florent"". Robb's wife is mostly just called ""Jeyne"" by Robb and Cat, but I don't remember anyone ever referring to her as Jeyne Stark. Margaery married <em>two</em> Baratheon kings and was still ""Margaery Tyrell"", and I don't know of any case where Rhaegar's wife was named as ""Elia Targaryan"".</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Unrelated side note, just to show how complex this stuff gets:</p>

<p>Referring to the Duchess of Cambridge as ""Catherine Middleton"" is not just impolite, it's flat out wrong. She should be addressed as ""Princess Catherine"" in all cases, but her ""legal"" surname is a matter of some confusion.  Queen Elizabeth and Prince Charles would give their surname as Windsor, if required. Queen Elizabeth has specified that her <em>non-royal</em> descendants will take the surname Mountbatten-Windsor, which shouldn't apply to Princess Catherine. However, when she needed to file suit in a foreign court, she gave her name as Mountbatten-Windsor, as did her husband. So, clearly, what to call the wife of a royal family member is absolutely not a straightforward question.</p>

<p>Are these hand-me-downs from an ancient age?</p>

<p>Seeing how the TV series doesn't answer this question yet, I will take quotes from the books or comments from George R R Martin.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","158820","<p>I won't discuss the fancy armor shown in the TV series <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/vq9dO.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">because reasons</a>. </p>

<p>But since you have added the books tag and you are okay with it, here goes.</p>

<p>It is simply unknown as of now. </p>

<p>Others, as an intelligent distinct species, are completely shrouded in mystery. Little to nothing is known about them, <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/128987/54887"">their origins</a>, their customs or their way of life. They are <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/135532/54887"">not like their minions</a>, who use the same armor they were wearing at time of their death. The armor they don is no ordinary armor. Every inch of it screams out ""MAGIC"". </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Had many talks with George. He told me of the ice swords, and <strong>the
  reflective, camouflaging armor that picks up the images of the things
  around it like a clear, still pond</strong>. He spoke a lot about what they
  were not, but what they were was harder to put into words.""<br> <sub>-<strong>Tommy Patterson</strong> <em>(Comic book artist for the series)</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A shadow emerged from the dark of the wood. It stood in front of
  Royce. Tall, it was, and gaunt and hard as old bones, with flesh pale
  as milk. <strong>Its armor seemed to change color as it moved; here it was
  white as new-fallen snow, there black as shadow, everywhere dappled
  with the deep grey-green of the trees.</strong> The patterns ran like
  moonlight on water with every step it took.<br><sub>AGOT -
  Prologue</sub> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So that proves that their armor is not of human craftsmanship.</p>

<p>Let's take all of the possibilities that you have listed and discuss them one by one. </p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Do they make their own in an industrial fashion?</strong> </p>

<p>Plausible but extremely unlikely. Others are not known to do that kind of manual labor nor does the Wild North offer such resources to be used as Raw material. Because if that was the case, Wildling realm would have developed craftsmanship on par with the realm South of the wall. But then again, they could be using magic, as you suggested but the key thing to remember about magic in WOIAF is that it's not Harry Potter magic where you just whip out your wand and do it. Every bit of magic requires certain raw objects to work (Such as Dany's sacrifices to give birth to her dragons, Kingsblood concept etc). What exactly would the Others have to make their brand of magic work?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Did they steal them?</strong></p>

<p>Steal them from whom? The Night's Watch? The Watch <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/134922/54887"">doesn't wear the armor</a> like the others do. Nor do any other humans. There's no one else to steal from. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Are they hand-me-downs from another age?</strong></p>

<p>We do not know. They could have some sort of arsenal intact somewhere in the North, long forgotten since the Battle for Dawn, as were the people who probably built it. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Family Heirlooms?</strong></p>

<p>What family? We do not know if the Others even have a concept of family or heirlooms or if <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/133486/how-does-a-baby-who-is-turned-into-white-walker-grow-into-an-adult-white-walker/133490#133490"">they could even procreate</a> to build a family. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>GRRM is silent on the matter as far as I know. He will probably use his standard response <em>""Keep Reading!""</em> if asked, I am afraid.</p>

<p>In my humble opinion, it may be that it is some sort of magic which requires certain sacrifices to build super weapons (Craster's children giving power to the weapons like Nisa Nisa did to Azor Ahai's sword?). In any case, the canon answer is:</p>

<p><strong>We do not know.</strong></p>

<p>Disappointing but that's what we have so far. </p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> As Skooba kindly pointed out, GRRM has hinted that the Others make their own swords. When asked about their swords:</p>

<p>As to the question of replacing the front piece, that's something that would require a) recalling all of the existing Dragons and re-minting them at vast cost and b) having ""Stags"" stand for both the gold <em>and</em> silver currency, confusing the general populace and potentially leading to ill-feeling and suggestions of counterfeiting/watering the currency. </p>

<p>This question is about the events in the show, not the books (in which things happen very differently) - although answers based on book information not presented in the show, and which does not contradict what we know from the show, are acceptable :-)</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> So after the Vale affair, Petyr Baelish offers Sansa to the Boltons as a wife, despite saying he expects Stannis to beat them and take Winterfell. 

 <p>That in itself does not make much sense, but his motivation seems to be revealed in this episode: He can make the Boltons look like traitors to Cersei. Truth be told, that's rather lame, since if Qyburn is doing any sort of work as Master of Whispers, he should have informed Cersei that it was Lord Baelish who offered Sansa, pulling the rug out from under his argument at the tete-a-tete with the Queen Mother. 

<p>But, let's put this contrivance aside and assume he had Sansa marry Ramsey Bolton for this purpose. 
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, what does this get him, exactly?  I mean,</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Cersei does not give him troops, nor money, nor does she get Lannister allies to act in any way. He's been promised to get to be 'Warden of the North' if he wipes out Stannis. Is he really in a position to lead the Vale to war against Stannis in support of the Lannisters? Even with a royal decree, I don't see how that's happening. Maybe he can manipulate lords who owe him money or something; but even then - it's not just Stannis, it's Stannis and the Iron Bank. Seriously, I don't see that happening. Even if he had pulled this off - who said he would win? Petyr Baelish never led men into battle in his life, and now he's to carry out a foreign invasion against a seasoned and accomplished military commander? Who will likely enjoy some support from the surrounding population? Finally, Baelish has a fixation on Sansa, why would he put her head on a spear for Cersei, especially having invested so much effort in getting her out of King's Landing?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I must be missing something. How are all these Sansa-centered machinations of any utility to Lord Baelish?</p>

<p><strong>Edit following Episode 7:</strong></p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> So now Baelish and Tyrell have sprung the trap on Cersei. This makes the request of sending armed men up north even more ridiculous, since even if he'd gotten her to accept that, she wouldn't get around to arranging it. Also, it's not even clear whether or not he's going to have that royal decree of his. This leads one to believe that everything he told Cersei was essentially babble to keep her distracted. That's fine, i.e. makes Baelish seem less of an idiot. 
 
 But then, the question remains: What's the use of sending Sansa over to marry Ramsey Bolton?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Edit following Season 5 Finale:</strong></p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Looks like whatever it is Baelish was planning, it isn't quite working out. He should probably have kept her in the vale - unless he has some fiendishly-clever idea I can't even fathom.</p>
</blockquote>
","<game-of-thrones><character-motivation>","91377","<p>After watching Season 5 Episode 8, it looks the benefit to Petyr Baelish is irrelevant, and this was done since it is simply too compelling plot-wise:</p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><dragons>","159022","<h3>Flawed Premise</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>In order to hatch a dragon in A Song of Ice and Fire, the eggs must be
  heated to an incredible heat</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who said that? Dragon incubators do not exist in Planetos. </p>

<p>Hatching a dragon is not that simple. </p>

<h3>Blood magic</h3>

<p>All the accomplishments of the Dragon Lords were thanks to Blood magic. They possibly used blood magic to hatch dragons from Wyverns and certainly used blood magic to bind Dragons to themselves. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In <strong>Septon Barth's Dragons, Wyrms, and Wyverns, he speculated that
  the bloodmages of Valyria used wyvern stock to create dragons</strong>.
  Though the bloodmages were alleged to have experimented mightily with
  their unnatural arts, this claim is considered far-fetched by most
  maesters, among them Maester Vanyon's Against the Unnatural contains
  certain proofs of dragons having existed in Westeros even in the
  earliest of days, before Valyria rose to be a power.<br><sub><strong><em>TWOIAF
  - Beyond the Free Cities: Sothoryos</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>also:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""What feeds a dragon's fire?"" Marwyn seated himself upon a stool.
  ""<strong>All Valyrian sorcery was rooted in blood or fire</strong>. The sorcerers
  of the Freehold could see across mountains, seas, and deserts with one
  of these glass candles. They could enter a man's dreams and give him
  visions, and speak to one another half a world apart, seated before
  their candles. Do you think that might be useful,
  Slayer?""<br><sub><strong><em>AFFC - Samwell V</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>How did Daenerys do it?</h3>

<p>The kind of Blood magic shown there is simple, you provide sacrifice of something and you get something in return. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You'll have gold, horses, whatever you like.""</p>
  
  <p>""It is not a matter of gold or horses. This is bloodmagic, lady.
  <strong>Only death may pay for life.</strong>""<br><sub><strong><em>AGOT - Daenerys VIII</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The eggs that Daenerys had were very old. They had turned into stones by the time they came into her possession. Fate of other dragon eggs would be similar since last living dragon died in reign of King Aegon III centuries ago. </p>

<p>Even Illyrio, who gave her the eggs, had no idea that they would hatch. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I know that he gave me my dragon eggs.""</p>
  
  <p>He snorted. ""<strong>If he'd known they were like to hatch, he'd would have
  sat on them himself.</strong>""</p>
  
  <p>That made her smile despite herself. ""Oh, I have no doubt of that,
  ser. I know Illyrio better than you think. I was a child when I left
  his manse in Pentos to wed my sun-and-stars, but I was neither deaf
  nor blind. And I am no child now.""<br><sub><strong><em>ACOK - Daenerys
  III</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Daenerys however figured out a way. She figured out the nature of Mirri Maz Duur's magic and cleverly improvised.</p>

<p>She provided sacrifice of:</p>

<ol>
<li>Khal Drogo</li>
<li>A horse.<sup>1</sup></li>
<li>Mirri Maz Duur herself</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You will not hear me scream,"" Mirri responded as the oil dripped from
  her hair and soaked her clothing.</p>
  
  <p>""I will,"" Dany said, ""but it is not your screams I want, only your
  life. <strong>I remember what you told me. Only death can pay for life.</strong>""
  Mirri Maz Duur opened her mouth, but made no reply. As she stepped
  away, Dany saw that the contempt was gone from the maegi's flat black
  eyes; in its place was something that might have been fear. Then there
  was nothing to be done but watch the sun and look for the first
  star.<br><sub><strong><em>AGOT - Daenerys X</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>For coup de grâce, she climbed into the pyre herself. As a result, the stone eggs came back to life and dragons were hatched.</p>

<p>This was a one-time magical event. Only time it ever succeeded. GRRM <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20001210110800/http://www.eventhorizon.com:80/sfzine/chats/transcripts/031899.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">cleared it up</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>George_RR_Martin</em></strong>: Granny, thanks for asking that. It gives me a chance
  to clear up a common misconception. TARGARYENS ARE NOT IMMUNE TO FIRE!
  <strong>The birth of Dany's dragons was unique, magical, wonderous, a miracle.</strong> She is called The Unburnt because she walked into the
  flames and lived. But her brother sure as hell wasn't immune to that
  molten gold.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not to mention, Daenerys might actually be someone very special. As Maester Aemon believed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What fools we were, who thought ourselves so wise! The error crept in
  from the translation. <strong>Dragons are neither male nor female</strong>, Barth saw
  the truth of that, but now one and now the other, as changeable as
  flame. The language misled us all for a thousand years. <strong>Daenerys is</strong>
  <strong>the one, born amidst salt and smoke. The dragons prove it.</strong><br><sub><strong><em>AFFC - Samwell IV</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Historical attempts</h3>

<p>That does not mean there were no attempts to rehatch dragons from stone-eggs before. King Aegon III asked mages and other scholars from Essos to hatch dragons from his cache of eggs. It failed. Prince Aerion drank wildfire thinking that it would transform him into a dragon. It failed. King Aegon V tried to use wildfire to hatch dragons, it failed and House Targaryen was wiped out save one lonely branch of Jaehaerys II Targaryen. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The look Stannis gave her was dark. ""Nine mages crossed the sea to
  hatch Aegon the Third's cache of eggs. Baelor the Blessed prayed over
  his for half a year. Aegon the Fourth built dragons of wood and iron.
  Aerion Brightflame drank wildfire to transform himself. The mages
  failed, King Baelor's prayers went unanswered, the wooden dragons
  burned, and Prince Aerion died screaming.""<br><sub><strong><em>ASOS - Davos
  V</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And also:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There were dragons here two hundred years ago, Sam found himself
  thinking, as he watched the cage making a slow descent. They would
  just have flown to the top of the Wall. Queen Alysanne had visited
  Castle Black on her dragon, and Jaehaerys, her king, had come after
  her on his own. Could Silverwing have left an egg behind? Or had
  Stannis found one egg on Dragonstone? Even if he has an egg, how can
  he hope to quicken it? Baelor the Blessed had prayed over his eggs,
  and other Targaryens had sought to hatch theirs with sorcery. All they
  got for it was farce and tragedy.<br><sub><strong><em>AFFC - Samwell I</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And also:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What became of the dream of dragons was a grievous tragedy born in a
  moment of joy. In the fateful year 259 AC, the king summoned many of
  those closest to him to Summerhall, his favorite castle, there to
  celebrate the impending birth of his first great-grandchild, a boy
  later named Rhaegar, to his grandson Aerys and granddaughter Rhaella,
  the children of Prince Jaehaerys.</p>
  
  <p>It is unfortunate that the tragedy that transpired at Summerhall left
  very few witnesses alive, and those who survived would not speak of
  it. A tantalizing page of Gyldayn's history—surely one of the very
  last written before his own death—hints at much, but the ink that was
  spilled over it in some mishap blotted out too much.</p>
  
  <p><em>...the blood of the dragon gathered in one... ...seven eggs, to honor the seven gods, though the king's own septon had warned...
  ...pyromancers... ...wild fire... ...flames grew out of
  control...towering...burned so hot that... ...died, but for the valor
  of the Lord Comman...</em><br><sub><strong><em>TWOIAF - The Targaryen Kings: Aegon
  V</em></strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>There is no indication whether other people in possession of Dragon eggs ever attempted to hatch them. They would have thought it futile given that eggs were dead stones. They were used as valuable commodity, not as livestock. So in conclusion:</p>

<ol>
<li>Blood magic is required to hatch dragons.</li>
<li>Existing eggs in current timeline are essentially stones.</li>
<li>Daenerys' feat was a one-time magical event, a miracle. </li>
</ol>

He then confronts Jaime in his cell and talks about this.</p>

<p>My question is did he or Catelyn ever come to know for sure that this was the real reason his father rebelled against the crown and got killed instead?</p>

<p>This confirmed the relation between Jaime and Cersie and must have made their suspicions stronger.</p>

"159110","How did people know that Varys is a eunuch?","<p>As the story begins, in the books or in the show, it is common knowledge that Varys is an eunuch. As he doesn't seem to deny it, readers or viewers quickly assume this is true.</p>

<p>However, I wonder why would he let people know his condition. Initially, there were only two people (the sorcerer and himself) that knew. So at some point, he started to tell people and let the rumor spread.</p>

<p>I don't think that this is something to brag about, but maybe Varys thought that letting people know would help him somehow. Did he intentionally let people know he was eunuch? Why?</p>

<p>His appearance might have betrayed him, but as he has some skills in disguise, he could have chosen to hide that fact. However, he seems to delight in his condition.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This is not a dupe. The target asks how can Eunuchs be told apart. This one asks if Varys is actually an eunuch and did he disclose his identity voluntarily.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","159111","<h3>Books</h3>
<p>No, the initial known discovery, if Illyrio can be believed, wasn't voluntary. At least until then Varys was ashamed of his condition and tried to hide it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In Myr he was a prince of thieves, until a rival thief informed on
him. <strong>In Pentos his accent marked him, and once he was known for a
eunuch he was despised and beaten</strong>. Why he chose me to protect him I
may never know, but we came to an arrangement. Varys spied on lesser
thieves and took their takings. I offered my help to their victims,
promising to recover their valuables for a fee. Soon every man who had
suffered a loss knew to come to me, whilst city's footpads and
cutpurses sought out Varys … half to slit his throat, the other half
to sell him what they'd stolen. We both grew rich, and richer still
when Varys trained his mice.&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>ADWD - Tyrion II</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After that it seems, Varys stopped trying to keep it a secret and embraced himself for what he was.</p>
<p>Aerys II Targaryen heard rumors of an exceptionally talented eunuch, Varys, and called him to his court. So he came to Westeros as a known Eunuch. I doubt anyone tried to make sure that he was really a Eunuch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I grew so respectable that a cousin of the Prince of Pentos let me
wed his maiden daughter, <strong>whilst whispers of a certain eunuch's
talents crossed the narrow sea and reached the ears of a certain
king</strong>. A very anxious king, who did not wholly trust his son, nor his
wife, nor his Hand, a friend of his youth who had grown arrogant and
overproud. I do believe that you know the rest of this tale, is that
not so?&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>ADWD - Tyrion II</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since everyone at court already knew he was a eunuch, what's the point of trying to hide it?</p>
<p>Not to mention, Varys looks the part. He is plump and hairless<sup>1</sup> like a Eunuch is supposed to be (As the only vice allowed to Eunuchs is eating so tend to be fat).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The Unsullied you may have seen in Pentos and Myr were household
guards. That's soft service, and <strong>eunuchs tend to plumpness in any
case. Food is the only vice allowed them</strong>. To judge all Unsullied by
a few old household slaves is like judging all squires by Arstan
Whitebeard, Your Grace. Do you know the tale of the Three Thousand of
Qohor?&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>ASOS - Daenerys  I</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>No one has ever observed him indulging into carnal desires either.</p>
<p>However, if you are asking is he really a Eunuch? The answer would be yes, unless GRRM says otherwise as the canon material only gives us Varys' word or word of other characters who probably never had the pleasure of looking at Varys' junk.</p>

<p>My personal opinion is that Shaggydog leaving Westeros and its magic (Children of the Forest, Weirwood network, etc.) is what is causing him to fade from the other direwolves' perception. This may be somewhat backed up by the fact that Ghost can no longer sense Summer (who is beyond the Wall).</p>

<p>Since you asked, in the books Dany is well aware that she needs to go and join the Dosh Khaleen:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A procession followed them out onto the godsway, the broad grassy road that ran through the heart of Vaes Dothrak, from the horse gate to the Mother of Mountains. The crones of the dosh khaleen came first, with their eunuchs and slaves. Some supported themselves with tall carved staffs as they struggled along on ancient, shaking legs, while others walked as proud as any horselord. Each of the old women had been a khaleesi once. When their lord husbands died and a new khal took his place at the front of his riders, with a new khaleesi mounted beside him, they were sent here, to reign over the vast Dothraki nation. Even the mightiest of khals bowed to the wisdom and authority of the dosh khaleen. <strong>Still, it gave Dany the shivers to think that one day she might be sent to join them, whether she willed it or no.</strong><br /><sup><em>-A Song of Ice and Fire: Book One - A Game of Thrones, Chapter Fourty-Six (<a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Game_of_Thrones-Chapter_46"" rel=""noreferrer"">Daenerys V</a>).</em> [emphasis mine]</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, when the time comes, she chooses not to as she has an epiphany and realises her true mission.<br>
In fact, Ser Jorah even tells her that he won't let her go to the Dosh Khaleen if she doesn't want to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“My... queen,” Ser Jorah said, going to one knee. “My sword that was his is yours, Daenerys. And my heart as well, that never belonged to your brother.

</blockquote>

<p>He says this because he thinks that Dany is about to walk into Drogo's funeral pyre to commit suicide:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I understand that you loved him,” Ser Jorah said in a voice thick with despair. “I loved my lady wife once, yet I did not die with her. You are my queen, my sword is yours, but do not ask me to stand aside as you climb on Drogo’s pyre. I will not watch you burn.”<br>
  “Is that what you fear?” Dany kissed him lightly on his broad forehead. “I am not such a child as that, sweet ser.”<br>
  “You do not mean to die with him? You swear it, my queen?”<br>
  “I swear it,” she said in the Common Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms that by rights were hers.<br /><sup><em>-Ibid.</em></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Kuhleesi is dumb</h2>

<p>The problem arises when you bring the show into the mix. Unfortunately, with such a huge production, it's viable that someone might forget this minute details of the story.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the show version of Dany tends to be depicted as knowledgeable, young and even naïve, as opposed to the fiercely strong and well-informed Daenerys of the books.</p>

<p>The scene you mention in Season 6 happens to be filled with inconsistencies of show vs. books:</p>

<p><strong>Books:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The Dosh Khaleen are respected and revered</li>
<li>The Dosh Khaleen are not treated as washed up bed slaves</li>
<li>Vaes Dothrak is a majestic and large city comprised of buildings and cultures of hundreds of civilisations</li>
<li>Vaes Dothrak has buildings which match the grandeur of the captured civilisations of the Dothraki, featuring buildings with 200 rooms</li>
<li>Vaes Dothrak is a common place where all Khalasars are considered one</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Show:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Vaes Dothrak is depicted as basically a wasteland with one main ""hut"" as its central point</li>
<li>The Khals seem to be in contention and tend to follow the orders of Khal <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Moro"" rel=""noreferrer"">Moro</a></li>
<li>The Dosh Khaleen are bound to the ""hut"" and treated as washed up bed slaves</li>
<li>The Dosh Khaleen are not respected</li>
</ul>

<p>So it's easy to see how they've added in this small tid-bit of Dany being surprised or whatever at the thought of having to be taken to Vaes Dothrak to join the Dosh Khaleen.</p>

<p>The only reason I can think of for this is that when she was told she'll be taken back, it's not really a surprise to her per se, rather that she realises the gravity of the situation and is terrified or dismayed at her outcome.</p>

<p>As a consequence, it's just a theory, but are there any clues?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><jon-snow>","90763","<p><strong>No.</strong></p>

<p>Remember that the <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/6974/21267"">theory about Jon's parentage</a>, is still a theory.</p>

<p>From the books, <strong><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aemon_Targaryen_%28son_of_Maekar_I%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Aemon Targaryen</a></strong> was not aware of <strong><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jon_Snow"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Jon Snow's</a></strong> parentage.</p>

<p>There is a comprehensive list of who knows about <strong>Jon's</strong> parentage in <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/31340/21267"">Who knows the truth about Jon Snow's parentage (father &amp; mother)</a>, in which <strong>Aemon</strong> does not appear as a likely candidate.</p>

<p>In reference to <strong><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Azor_Ahai"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Azor Ahai</a></strong>, <strong>Aemon</strong> has a realisation that it must be <strong><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daenerys_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Daenerys</a></strong>, meaning that he believes her to be the <em>only</em> possible option:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Braavos, it had seemed possible that Aemon might recover. Xhondo’s talk of dragons had almost seemed to restore the old man to himself. That night he ate every bite Sam put before him. “No one ever looked for a girl,” he said. “It was a prince that was promised, not a princess. Rhaegar, I thought... the smoke was from the fire that devoured Summerhall on the day of his
  birth, the salt from the tears shed for those who died. He shared my belief when he was young, but later he became persuaded that it was his own son who fulfilled the prophecy, for a comet had been seen above King’s Landing on the night Aegon was conceived, and Rhaegar was certain the bleeding star had to be a comet. What fools we were, who thought ourselves so wise! The error crept in from the translation. Dragons are neither male nor female, Barth saw the truth of that, but now one and now the other, as changeable as flame. The language misled us all for a thousand years. Daenerys is the one, born amidst salt and smoke. The dragons prove it.” Just talking of her seemed to make him stronger. “I must go to her. I must. Would that I was even ten years younger.”<br /><sup><em>-A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Four - A Feast for Crows, Chapter 35 (<a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Feast_for_Crows-Chapter_35"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Samwell IV</a>).</em></sup></p>

<p>There are also many situations where <strong>Aemon</strong> speaks with <strong>Jon</strong> and tells him things in reference to his family, The Starks - and not anyone else - not even a single allusion to anything extra.</p>

<p>In fact, the most recent discussion they have is one in which <strong>Aemon</strong> give <strong>Jon</strong> some advice about how to 'rule' succesfully as Lord Commander of the Night's Watch:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aemon’s final words. “Allow me to give my lord one last piece of counsel,” the old man had said, “the same counsel that I once gave my brother when we parted for the last time. He was three-and-thirty when the Great Council chose him to mount the Iron Throne. A man grown with sons of his own, yet in some ways still a boy. Egg had an innocence to him, a sweetness we all loved. Kill the boy within you, I told him the day I took ship for the Wall. It takes a man to rule. An Aegon, not an Egg. Kill the boy and let the man be born.” The old man felt Jon’s face. “You are half the age that Egg was, and your own burden is a crueler one, I fear. You will have little joy of your command, but I think you have the strength in you to do the things that must be done. Kill the boy, Jon Snow. Winter is almost upon us. Kill the boy and let the man be born.”<br /><sup><em>-A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Five - A Dance With Dragons, Chapter 7 (<a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Dance_with_Dragons-Chapter_7"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Jon II</a>).</em></sup></p>

<p>From what I know and have seen, there has been no communication between the possible 'knowers' of the truth and <strong>Aemon</strong>.

<p>Why <em>would</em> anyone tell him anything of the sort? ""Hey Aemon, not sure if you're interested but you know that bastard kid from Winterfell? Well, he's actually ... And if he ever decides to join The Watch, just look out for him ok?"" &lt;-- doesn't make sense.</p>

"90913","Is the Game Of Thrones Telltale game series canon?","<p>I am planning to give the <em>Game Of Thrones</em> <em>Telltale</em> series of 3 episodes so far a shot. However, I am wondering if this series of games is canon. I have read here and there that this series explores the stories of a minor Northern house (House Forrester I think) and that the timeline is really close to the ASOIAF timeline (if not included in it).</p>

<p>So is the stuff written by GRRM, or at least developed with his approval rendering it hence canon?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><canon>","90923","<p>If it's canon with anything, it would be the show.  It was made using HBO's license, not one gotten direct from GRRM.  You'll note that in the logo, it matches the HBO show's style and it lacks the 'A' in <strong><em>A</strong> Game of Thrones</em>.   Also the familiar characters we see in the game are modeled after the actors from the show.</p>

<p>In terms of timeline it's between the colored weddings that we've seen in the show (i.e. post-Red Wedding, pre-Purple Wedding), at least so far.  The game's first 'season' is not complete, so we don't have the complete story yet.  As linked from the Wikipedia page, <a href=""http://www.polygon.com/2013/12/23/5224694/how-telltale-teamed-up-with-game-of-thrones-and-borderlands"">this article says</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Allison noted the Games of Thrones project, though still in early development stages, took more than a year of conversation with HBO to seal the deal — a multi-year, multi-title deal, to be exact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this first batch of episodes is just the first of several.</p>

<p>In terms of canonicity, the Wikipedia page links to <a href=""http://www.gamespot.com/articles/george-r-r-martin-s-assistant-working-with-telltale-on-game-of-thrones/1100-6419276/"">this article</a>:</p>

Martin's personal assistant Ty Corey Franck is working with Telltale Games as a ""story consultant"" for the developer's upcoming episodic series based on the acclaimed fantasy franchise.</p>

<p>I have not found any official evidence of <em>why</em> they have done this.

<p>Any word from D&amp;D? Any word from GRRM? Any word from HBO?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","91072","<p>There's only one answer - <strong>they're not essential (<em>yet?</em>) for the story HBO is telling</strong>. HBO's priority is making that story into one which works on television, not preserving everything from the books.</p>

<p>I say ""yet?"" because, with the possible exceptions of Arianne and Quentyn (who appear to have gone the way of Garlan Tyrell), there's always the possibility they could be introduced with adapted stories should they become necessary. For example, I was convinced Ser Dontas had been written out of the show when he didn't repeatedly meet with Sansa  like in the books, and I was expecting someone like Brienne to do an adapted version of his role. Instead, he was reintroduced at the last minute, with a much shorter version of his story, with just enough context for the plot and no more.</p>

<p><strong>It all hinges on what happens in books unwritten</strong>. We know that the show intends to very roughly follow the trajectory of the books GRRM hasn't written yet, which presumably means the fates of  the families overall and A-list characters like Dany and Tyrion will <em>broadly</em> match. Will Aegon, Euron, Victarion etc be irreplacable parts of this core story? If so, don't be surprised if they are rapidly introduced later - when they start to become essential, and no sooner.</p>

<p>Update now Season 6 is out:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Euron has suddenly appeared, and rapidly reached a point similar to where he ends in A Dance With Dragons, ready to start taking a part in the main plot. 
 <br/><br/>
 Interestingly, his actor is someone quite different to what many book readers expected - someone less suited to fearsome imposing villains, more associated with playing complex, troubled, ambiguous enigmas. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>This is why no-one involved in the show's production will <em>or should</em> comment</strong>.  If they say, for example, that Connington is definitively cut,  ruling out the possibility of him making a surprise appearance, then that's a spoiler for books that haven't been written yet. It'd  strongly suggest that he's not going to have an irreplaceable role in the central story. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ned frowned. The man Syrio Forel had come with an excellent reputation, and his flamboyant Braavosi style was well suited to Arya’s
  slender blade, yet still ... a few days ago, she had been wandering around with a swatch of black silk tied over her eyes.

  <p>She nodded. “Tomorrow we’re going to catch cats.”</p>
  
  <p>“Cats.” Ned sighed. “Perhaps it was a mistake to hire this Braavosi. If you like, I will ask Jory to take over your lessons. Or I might have a quiet word with Ser Barristan. He was the finest sword in the Seven Kingdoms in his youth.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>2. What is the First Sword of Braavos doing in King's Landing?</em></strong></p>

<p>Syrio Forel was no longer the First Sword of Braavos. He himself mentions that.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The steel must be part of your arm,” the bald man told her. “Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos, he knows these things. Listen to him, boy.”</p>

<p>Most probably he was looking for a job.</p>

<p><strong>Updating my answer based on GRRM's interview</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, I’ve never given it much thought. Ned was searching for a fencing master who could teach Arya, and he knew it couldn’t not be a conventional master at arms or a knight, or the castle master at arms, because he didn’t think his young daughter could handle a broadsword (or maybe longsword) the way man with greater strength in their torso could, so he decided the Braavosi style suited her best. Who was available in the city that might fit the bill? Obviously, somebody had to recommend him to Ned. I believe Syrio must have been in the city at the time, because there wasn’t enough time to send for someone all the way from Braavos.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> arrested Loras, Margery, and Cersei for different crimes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, there is something really strange in these actions. All crimes mentioned in the show have been performed <strong>before</strong> the restoration of Faith Militant. The common logic is that you cannot punish for a crime retroactively, that is, for something that a person committed before there actually was a law forbidding that.</p>

<p>Now, before the 5th season such a sin as</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> the homosexuality of Loras</p>
</blockquote>

<p>was definitely not considered a serious crime, that demanded an arrest. The Littlefinger's establishment (whore house) was actually a legal thing in the previous seasons. So, why the prosecution at all for this? I don't think that even the High Sparrow is such a big fanatic to punish someone retroactively. So, the question is. Why did they arrest</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Loras, who performed his sins before Faith Militant was actually in active state? And why did they arrest Margery, who was just a witness of a sex scene and did not even take part in it?</p>

<p>The only person they did arrest correctly, IMHO, is</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Cersei, who actually cheated on her husband.</p>

<p>But they don't even know that for sure! Because</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Cersei had an affair with this Pycelle character after her husband's death, which is technically not a cheat, and they have no witness confirming the twincest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, any explanation for that? AFAIK, in the books the charges were much more serious, and would be considered a crime even before the faith militant came in the game.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","91017","<p>Might makes right! Nuf said.</p>

<p>The ""High Sparrow"" has a standing army that the idiot Cersei gave him. So now he can punish whomever he wants for whatever he wants as he has soldiers protecting him.</p>

<p>In the books everything happens differently regarding Loras, his sister and Cersei, but the outcome, for Cersei at least, is the same. Ironic that it was her actions that eventually put her in that situation.</p>

<p>In the show it is a sin to have sex outside of wedlock, to have sex with the same gender, to lie, etc. Loras is accused of having sex with another male, he denied it, and a witness was found confirming to the High Septon that Loras lied. Margaery lied for his Brother so she is guilty too. That is why she is a prisoner of the Faith at the moment.</p>

<p>Now to explain why it is only now that the ""Faith Laws"" are enforced. </p>

<p>The previous High Septon had his own ""unnatural appetites"" so he couldn't accuse others when it was known that he was just as bad. Also the previous Septon didn't have an army at his beck and call. The current one does.</p>

<p>And there is a quote from the last episode when he is talking to the Queen of Thorns:</p>

</blockquote>
","<game-of-thrones>","91018","<p>Yes, though (for obvious reasons) the act itself is never shown on-screen, Ramsay quite definitively gelded Theon.</p>

<p>The scene begins with Theon being seduced by two of Ramsay's women, but only as part of Ramsay's torture plans. They make repeated comments about how well-endowed Theon is rumored to be. Once Ramsay comes in, he surmises that Theon's manhood is the part of his body he most treasures. He then pulls out a knife, and two men hold Theon down while Ramsay cuts him. (The knife is a gelding knife, the kind used to geld horses and, presumably, eunuchs.)</p>

<p>Later, Ramsay sends a package to Theon's family to show what's been done to Theon. Again, we never see the contents, but it's very strongly implied that it's Theon's castrated member in the box.</p>

<hr>

<p>This is one case where the show is actually being more graphic than the novel. Ramsay's torture of Theon is revealed mostly through flashbacks much later, and not in as graphic detail. The piece of Theon that Ramsay sent to the Greyjoys is just described as a ""piece of his flesh"". The only indication in the novels we have about the castration, as @MikeyMouse points out, is when Theon admits that he can't have sex with Jeyne in front of Ramsay because he lacks the equipment.</p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","91096","<p><strong>Yes! and he's even blatant about it too (in the books).</strong></p>

<p>On many occasions <strong><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jorah_Mormont"">Jorah</a></strong> shows signs of not only loving <strong><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daenerys_Targaryen"">Daenerys</a></strong> as his sovereign and her being the Mother of Dragons, he also shows signs of having feelings towards her, <em>romantically</em>.</p>

<p>He confesses to Dany that his second wife <strong><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lynesse_Hightower"">Lynesse Hightower</a></strong> looks like Dany, which Dany realises that it explains a lot:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She gave him leave to go, but as he was lifting the flap of her tent, she could not stop herself calling after him with one last question. “What did she look like, your Lady Lynesse?”<br />
  Ser Jorah smiled sadly. “Why, she looked a bit like you, Daenerys.” He bowed low. “Sleep well, my queen.”<br />
  Dany shivered, and pulled the lionskin tight about her. She looked like me. It explained much that she had not truly understood. He wants me, she realized. He loves me as he loved her, not as a knight loves his queen but as a man loves a woman.<br /><sup><em>-A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Two - A Clash of Kings, Chapter Twelve (<a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Clash_of_Kings-Chapter_12"">Daenerys I</a>).</em></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In <em>A Storm of Swords</em> he grabs her and kisses her when they're alone and tells her that he loves her and that they should get married, but she kindly walks him straight back to his Friendzone:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“What if Captain Groleo refuses to change course, though? And Arstan, Strong Belwas, what will they do?”<br />
  Ser Jorah stood. “Perhaps it’s time you found that out.”<br />
  “Yes,” she decided. “I’ll do it!” Dany threw back the coverlets and hopped from the bunk. “I’ll see the captain at once, command him to set course for Astapor.” She bent over her chest, threw open the lid, and seized the first garment to hand, a pair of loose sandsilk trousers. “Hand me my medallion belt,” she commanded Jorah as she pulled the sandsilk up over her hips. “And my vest -” she started to say, turning.<br />
  Ser Jorah slid his arms around her.<br />
  “Oh,” was all Dany had time to say as he pulled her close and pressed his lips down on hers. He smelled of sweat and salt and leather, and the iron studs on his jerkin dug into her naked breasts as he crushed her hard against him. One hand held her by the shoulder while the other slid down her spine to the small of her back, and her mouth opened for his tongue, though she never told it to. His beard is scratchy, she thought, but his mouth is sweet. The Dothraki wore no beards, only long mustaches, and only Khal Drogo had ever kissed her before. He should not be doing this. I am his queen, not his woman.<br />
  It was a long kiss, though how long Dany could not have said. When it ended, Ser Jorah let go of her, and she took a quick step backward. “You... you should not have...”<br />
  “I should not have waited so Iong,” he finished for her. “I should have kissed you in Qarth, in Vaes Tolorro. I should have kissed you in the red waste, every night and every day. You were made to be kissed, often and well.” His eyes were on her breasts.<br />Dany covered them with her hands, before her nipples could betray her. “I... that was not fitting. I am your queen.”<br />
  “My queen,” he said, “and the bravest, sweetest, and most beautiful woman I have ever seen. Daenerys -<br />
  “Your Grace!”<br />
  “Your Grace,” he conceded, “the dragon has three heads, remember? You have wondered at that, ever since you heard it from the warlocks in the House of Dust. Well, here’s your meaning: Balerion, Meraxes, and Vhagar, ridden by Aegon, Rhaenys, and Visenya. The three-headed dragon of House Targaryen - three dragons, and three riders.”<br />
  “Yes,” said Dany, “but my brothers are dead.”<br />
  “Rhaenys and Visenya were Aegon’s wives as well as his sisters. You have no brothers, but you can take husbands. And I tell you truly, Daenerys, there is no man in all the world who will ever be half so true to you as me.”<br /><sup><em>-A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Three - A Storm of Swords, Chapter Eight (<a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Storm_of_Swords-Chapter_8"">Daenerys I</a>).</em></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He tells her so again when she banishes him:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I protected you. I fought for you. Killed for you.”<br />
  Kissed me, she thought, betrayed me.<br />
  “I went down into the sewers like a rat. For you.”<br />
  It might have been kinder if you’d died there. Dany said nothing. There was nothing to say.<br />
  “Daenerys,” he said, “<strong>I have loved you.</strong>”<br />
  And there it was. Three treasons will you know once for blood and once for gold and once for love.<br /><sup><em>-A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Three - A Storm of Swords, Chapter Fourty-Two (<a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Storm_of_Swords-Chapter_71"">Daenerys VI</a>).</em></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But to no avail, she banishes him and he embarks on his quest to escape the dreaded Friendzone; and fails miserably, even finds a whore in the Volantene whorehouse who looks like Dany. Oh, poor Jorah!</p>

<p>But this is why he goes through the trouble of trying to take <strong><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tyrion_Lannister"">Tyrion</a></strong> back to Dany, he thinks that it will win back her trust for him.</p>

"91125","Was Eddard Stark as good a/better swordsman as/than Jaime Lannister?","<p>I have a group of friends that all have read the books (not so solid on the show though), and one of them brought up that Ned (Eddard) Stark was one of the best swordsmen in Westeros. </p>

<p>At the time, he couldn't remember what the evidence to back this claim up was, just that he had ""read it on the internet somewhere"". Though Ned holds a special place in my heart, and I would love to believe that this is true, is there any real evidence in the books/show that support the claim of his swordsmanship? </p>

<p>Note: after him saying this and with it in mind, you can see that in the episode of ""Game of Thrones"" where the Lannisters apprehend Ned that he holds his own against Jaime for a short time before being stabbed, and during which time Jaime had a look on his face that seemed to acknowledge his opponents skill and enjoy the challenge. This, of course, it not enough to support/debunk the claim, but I thought it an interesting place to start.</p>

"91175","To what do the Great Houses of Westeros owe their longevity?","<p>Why are the great houses of Westeros so long lived? For example, the Starks have been kings and later Wardens of the North for nearly 8,000 since Bran the Builder. Again, the Arryns of the Vale and the Tyrrells of the Reach have long been lords of their domain. </p>

<p>In comparable societies in Europe for example, the Habsburgs ruled for only several centuries. And in China the Qing? ruled for at least 4. Is there a precedent for houses to last this long in out time, and to what do the Great Houses of Westeros owe this longevity?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","91295","<p>Of the eight Great Houses only three have been lords of their domain for a long time: The Starks, the Lannisters and the Arryns. On the other hand, the Baratheons, the Tyrells, the Tullys and the Greyjoys owe their rise in station to the Targaryen conquests (barely 300 years old) that extinguished the Durrandons, the Gardeners and the Hoares. Similarly, the Martells only rose to prominence when they allied themselves with the Rhoynar 500-1000 years ago. </p>

<p>House Stark's reign does indeed date to at least 8000 years (although some Measters dispute those numbers due to the lack of sources) but those were far from being undisputed. The Boltons have been a constant thorn, and at least one cadet branch (the Graystarks) have attempted coupes. The fact that the Starks have remained in power is possibly due to the power sustained by the massive holdings surrounding Winterfell, and the seemingly undying loyalty of the Northmen to the Starks. </p>

<p>On a similar vein, the Lannisters massive ancestral gold mines have kept them rich enough to stay on top, while the impregnable Eyrie has kept the Arryns safe from all aggressors until the Targaryen dragons arrived. </p>

"91269","Is Mace Tyrell ""The Lord Oaf of High Garden"" in the books?","<p>I haven't read the books, although I am vaguely familiar with the main story lines and the characters.</p>
<p>In the TV show, Mace Tyrell is portrayed like a buffoon, an oaf. Olenna Tyrell calls him that on several occasions, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Lord Oaf of Highgarden</p>
<p><sub>Game of Thrones, Season 3 Episode 2, &quot;Dark Wings, Dark Words&quot;</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the fourth and fifth seasons he seems to be a spineless idiot that is trying to please the Lannisters royalty, complete with idiotic jokes.</p>
<p><strong>Is Mace Tyrell portrayed as equally silly and spineless oaf in the books?</strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","91281","<p>Yes, it's in the books. Olenna did call Mace Tyrell ""Lord oaf"" and much more.</p>

<p><em>A Storm of Swords</em>, chapter 6, Sansa I.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother,” said Margaery. “Father
  liked him as well, and so did Loras.”</p>
  
  <p>“Loras is young,” Lady Olenna said crisply, “and very good at knocking
  men off horses with a stick. That does not make him wise. <strong>As to your
  father, would that I’d been born a peasant woman with a big wooden
  spoon, I might have been able to beat some sense into his fat head.”</strong></p>
  
  <p>“Mother,” Lady Alerie scolded.</p>
  
  <p>“Hush, Alerie, don’t take that tone with me. And don’t call me Mother.
  If I’d given birth to you, I’m sure I’d remember. <strong>I’m only to blame
  for your husband, the lord oaf of Highgarden.</strong>”</p>
  
  <p>“Grandmother,” Margaery said, “mind your words, or what will Sansa
  think of us?”</p>
  
  <p>“She might think we have some wits about us. One of us, at any rate.”
  The old woman turned back to Sansa. “It’s treason, I warned them,
  Robert has two sons, and Renly has an older brother, how can he
  possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair? Tut-tut, says my son,
  don’t you want your sweetling to be queen? You Starks were kings once,
  the Arryns and the Lannisters as well, and even the Baratheons through
  the female line, <strong>but the Tyrells were no more than stewards until
  Aegon the Dragon came along and cooked the rightful King of the Reach
  on the Field of Fire. If truth be told, even our claim to Highgarden
  is a bit dodgy, just as those dreadful Florents are always whining.
  ‘What does it matter?’ you ask, and of course it doesn’t, except to
  oafs like my son.</strong> The thought that one day he may see his grandson
  with his arse on the Iron Throne makes Mace puff up like . . . now,
  what do you call it? Margaery, you’re clever, be a dear and tell your
  poor old half-daft grandmother the name of that queer fish from the
  Summer Isles that puffs up to ten times its own size when you poke
  it.”</p>
  
  <p>“They call them puff fish, Grandmother.”</p>
  
  <p>“Of course they do. Summer Islanders have no imagination. My son ought
  to take the puff fish for his sigil, if truth be told. He could put a
  crown on it, the way the Baratheons do their stag, mayhap that would
  make him happy. We should have stayed well out of all this bloody
  foolishness if you ask me, but once the cow’s been milked there’s no
  squirting the cream back up her udder. <strong>After Lord Puff Fish put that
  crown on Renly’s head, we were into the pudding up to our knees</strong>, so
  here we are to see things through. And what do you say to that,
  Sansa?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And again in the same chapter.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As the servants brought out a broth of leeks and mushrooms,
  Butterbumps began to juggle and Lady Olenna pushed herself forward to
  rest her elbows on the table. <strong>“Do you know my son, Sansa? Lord Puff
  Fish of Highgarden?”</strong></p>
  
  <p>“A great lord,” Sansa answered politely.</p>
  
  <p>“<strong>A great oaf,” said the Queen of Thorns. “His father was an oaf as
  well. My husband, the late Lord Luthor.</strong> Oh, I loved him well enough,
  don’t mistake me. A kind man, and not unskilled in the bedchamber, but
  an appalling oaf all the same. He managed to ride off a cliff whilst
  hawking. They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to
  where his horse was taking him.</p>
  
  <p>“<strong>And now my oaf son is doing the same, only he’s riding a lion instead
  of a palfrey. It is easy to mount a lion and not so easy to get off, I
  warned him, but he only chuckles.</strong> Should you ever have a son, Sansa,
  beat him frequently so he learns to mind you. I only had the one boy
  and I hardly beat him at all, so now he pays more heed to Butterbumps
  than he does to me. A lion is not a lap cat, I told him, and he gives
  me a ‘tut-tut-Mother.’ There is entirely too much tut-tutting in this
  realm, if you ask me. All these kings would do a deal better if they
  would put down their swords and listen to their mothers.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But no he's not that foolish. Mace knows that the Lannisters need him, and tries to use this for the benefit of his house and for personal benefit as well. Maybe he is too ambitious and sometimes this blinds him, like when he approached Cersei during the funeral of Lord Tywin (AFFC, chapter 7, Cersei) and hinted that he wants the Hand's position, and also reminded her that Tywin did promise the position of Master of Coins to his Uncle. This angers Cersei and in the end no Tyrells make it in Cersei's small council. So Mace serving under Cersei happens only in the TV show.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Of course, it could also be a subtle bit of characterization, as you suggest, intended to show that Mace is an idiot who does not know his Westerosi history.

If not, I'm erring on the side of TV canon. I'm sorry this important distinction was striped from the original question.</sub> </p>
","<game-of-thrones>","91371","<p>Actually it's well established in the Books how and why Arya ended in The House of Black and White, Braavos.</p>
<p>TL;DR</p>
<p>Right after the Hound gets a mortal wound and Arya parts with him, she arrives in a small town <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Saltpans"" rel=""noreferrer"">Saltpans</a>. She wants to make it to the Wall, because Jon Snow's there. She buys her passage on a Braavosi galleas with the iron coin given to her by Jaqen. But the captain refuses to sail to the North, so instead she ends up in Braavos. In Braavos she visits the house of the Black and White and seeks Jaqen to learn the art of being assassin. And she wants blood and revenge.</p>
<p>Now the long answer, with the quotes from the book.</p>
<p>ASOS, chapter 74, Arya.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I want to see the captain,” Arya told him. He only shouted louder.
But the commotion drew the attention of a stout grey-haired man in a
coat of purple wool, and he spoke the Common Tongue. “I am captain
here,” he said. “What is your wish? Be quick, child, we have a tide to
catch.”</p>
<p><strong>“I want to go north, to the Wall. Here, I can pay.” She gave him the
purse. “The Night’s Watch has a castle on the sea.”</strong></p>
<p>“Eastwatch.” The captain spilled out the silver onto his palm and
frowned. “Is this all you have?”</p>
<p><strong>It is not enough, Arya knew without being told. She could see it on
his face.</strong></p>
<p>...
...
...</p>
<p><strong>“Wait,” Arya said suddenly. “I have something else.”</strong> She had stuffed
it down inside her smallclothes to keep it safe, so she had to dig
deep to find it, while the oarsmen laughed and the captain lingered
with obvious impatience. “One more silver will make no difference,
child,” he finally said.</p>
<p>“It’s not silver.” Her fingers closed on it. <strong>“It’s iron. Here.” She
pressed it into his hand, the small black iron coin that Jaqen H’ghar
had given her</strong>, so worn the man whose head it bore had no features.
It’s probably worthless, but . . .
<strong>The captain turned it over and blinked at it, then looked at her
again. “This . . . how . . . ?”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jaqen said to say the words too. Arya crossed her arms against her
chest. “Valar morghulis,” she said, as loud as if she’d known what it
meant.</strong></p>
<p>“Valar dohaeris,” he replied, touching his brow with two fingers. “Of
course you shall have a cabin.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's how Arya bought her passage. But to what place, that's revealed in the next chapter.</p>
<p>AFFC, chapter 6, Arya</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Arya stood at the prow, one hand resting on the gilded figurehead, a
maiden with a bowl of fruit. <strong>For half a heartbeat she let herself
pretend that it was her home ahead.</strong></p>
<p>B<strong>ut that was stupid. Her home was gone, her parents dead, and all her
brothers slain but Jon Snow on the Wall. That was where she had wanted
to go. She told the captain as much, but even the iron coin did not
sway him. Arya never seemed to find the places she set out to reach.
Yoren had sworn to deliver her to Winterfell, only she had ended up in
Harrenhal and Yoren in his grave. When she escaped Harrenhal for
Riverrun, Lem and Anguy and Tom o’ Sevens took her captive and dragged
her to the hollow hill instead. Then the Hound had stolen her and
dragged her to the Twins. Arya had left him dying by the river and
gone ahead to Saltpans, hoping to take passage for
Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, only . . .</strong></p>
<p><strong>Braavos might not be so bad. Syrio was from Braavos, and Jaqen might
be there as well. It was Jaqen who had given her the iron coin. He
hadn’t truly been her friend, the way that Syrio had, but what good
had friends ever done her?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's how she ends up in Braavos.</p>
<p>And again in the same chapter when she enters the House of Black and White, she has the following conversation with a old man, later called &quot;the kindly man&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What place is this?” she asked him.</p>
<p>“A place of peace.” His voice was gentle. “You are safe here. This is
the House of Black and White, my child. Though you are young to seek
the favor of the Many-Faced God.”</p>
<p>“Is he like the southron god, the one with seven faces?”</p>
<p>“Seven? No. He has faces beyond count, little one, as many faces as
there are stars in the sky. In Braavos, men worship as they will . . .
but at the end of every road stands Him of Many Faces, waiting. He
will be there for you one day, do not fear. You need not rush to his
embrace.”</p>
<p><strong>“I only came to find Jaqen H’ghar.”</strong></p>
<p>“I do not know this name.”</p>
<p>Her heart sank. “He was from Lorath. His hair was white on one side
and red on the other. <strong>He said he’d teach me secrets</strong>, and gave me
this.” The iron coin was clutched in her fist. When she opened her
fingers, it clung to her sweaty palm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She's there for Jaqen, and she wants to learn. And as for her motivation, again in this very chapter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Do you fear death?”</p>
<p>She bit her lip. “No.”</p>
<p>“Let us see.” The priest lowered his cowl. Beneath he had no face;
only a yellowed skull with a few scraps of skin still clinging to the
cheeks, and a white worm wriggling from one empty eye socket. “Kiss
me, child,” he croaked, in a voice as dry and husky as a death rattle.</p>
<p>Does he think to scare me? Arya kissed him where his nose should be
and plucked the grave worm from his eye to eat it, but it melted like
a shadow in her hand.</p>
<p>The yellow skull was melting too, and the kindliest old man that she
had ever seen was smiling down at her. “No one has ever tried to eat
my worm before,” he said. “Are you hungry, child?”</p>
<p><strong>Yes, she thought, but not for food.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She wants revenge. She's hungry for the blood.</p>

A constant theme in both the books and the show is that the Night's Watch is severely under-manned and isn't being given the resources and manpower it needs to do its job. Most of the fortresses and castles along the wall are unmanned and in disrepair (you'll remember that the order Janos Slynt refused was to go repair and fortify one of these called Greyguard). </p>

<p>This situation was bad enough when the Night's Watch just had to deal with the Wildlings. But the White Walkers are such an overwhelming threat that there's just no way the Night's Watch can hope to contain it. So, to have any chance of survival, Jon needs allies. Since the rest of the Seven Kingdoms is mostly content to ignore the repeated warnings coming from the Wall, Jon turns to the only potential allies he has left: the Wildlings.</p>

<p>Jon also knows that if the Wildlings fall to the White Walkers, the only purpose it would serve would be to make the Walkers stronger. Every Wildling killed becomes one more member of the horde.</p>

<p>So, either he makes common cause with the Wildlings, which offers a small hope of defeating their common enemy. Or he leaves them to their fate, which only swells the ranks of the White Walker army.</p>

<p><strong>The humanitarian reasons</strong></p>

<p>Jon knows that the White Walkers represent an existential threat to all men everywhere, regardless of whether they live north of the Wall or not. He makes a comment that the Night's Watch is supposed be ""the shield that guards the realms of men."" He goes on to say that the Wildlings are men and so the oath applies to them too.</p>

<p><strong>Why isn't the rest of the Watch on board?</strong></p>

<p>It shouldn't be hard to guess. Most of the watch have lost friends and brothers to the Wildlings. Jon himself says he lost 50 brothers during their attack on the Wall. They have all spent their entire time in the Watch up to this point fighting against the Wildlings. That's a lot of history and baggage to overcome. </p>

<p>In the show, they present this most explicitly in the character of Olly, who serves as Jon's steward. He watched the Wildlings murder his parents and most of his village during a raid. He understandably hates the Wildlings for this. And now Jon wants to ally with them and give them land south of the wall to settle on. So, from Olly's perspective, they murdered his parents and are now being invited to move in next door.</p>
"
"91670","Why did Mance Rayder unite the clans?","<p>The King-Beyond-the-Wall, Mance Rayder, united the clans of the wildlings to save them from the terrible fate that awaits them in the long winter.</p>

<p>In the fifth season of <em>Game of Thrones</em>, he claims that it is his only motivation for doing that. To save his people. And twice in this season it is mentioned that it took him twenty years or so.</p>

<p>But this seems odd, for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The summer lasted for ten years, so the last winter was more than that, and probably not very long either (I want to say three years, but I'm not sure).</p></li>
<li><p>The first documented sight of the White Walkers was quite recently.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Presumably the Free Folk know about the Walkers for a longer time now, but 20 years seems to go through at least one winter where nothing happened. If something had happened, there would have been repercussions (like many people fleeing south, and the word eventually reaching beyond the wall).</p>

<p><strong>How did Mance know to start uniting the clans 20 years ago?</strong></p>

<p>(Some minor timeline additions I feel obligated to make after re-watching S01E04. Ser Alliser tells Jon and Sam that during last winter he was part of a ranging party beyond the wall because they heard Mance was planning to attack the wall; and they got stuck for six months. So at least as far as TV canon goes, Mance was already powerful during last winter which is at least a decade ago.)</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","91737","<p>How much time it took Mance to unite clans, according to the books from 10 to 12 years.</p>

<p>In the very first chapter of the AGOT, Bran.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>It was the ninth year of summer, and the seventh of Bran’s life.</strong></p>
  
  <p>The man had been taken outside a small holdfast in the hills. <strong>Robb
  thought he was a wildling, his sword sworn to Mance Rayder, the
  King-beyond-the-Wall.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bran was born in 290 AC, so the chapter takes place in 297-298 AC. By this time Mance is already known as King beyong the Wall.</p>

<p>ASOS, chapter 7, Jon.</p>

<p>Mance says that he has seen Jon twice. First time -</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You were just a boy, and I was all in black, one of a dozen riding
  escort to old Lord Commander Qorgyle when he came down to see your
  father at Winterfell. I was walking the wall around the yard when I
  came on you and your brother Robb. It had snowed the night before, and
  the two of you had built a great mountain above the gate and were
  waiting for someone likely to pass underneath.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jon was born in 283 AC. Jon playing in the yard and building mountain of snow, well that makes him at least 3 years old (even in fantasy world a boy has to be old enough for certain things). So this event takes place in 286-287.</p>

<p>Now simple math, Mance deserted in 286 and in 298 he's King beyond the Wall, so at worst it took 12 years to unite clans. Mance deserted in 287 and in 297 he's King beyond the Wall, so at best it took 10 years to unite clans.</p>

<p>Motives and why did Mance united clans, well that's the hardest part of your question. We don't have Mances pov in the books and I don't recall him saying what his motives are. So we have to rely on other characters.</p>

<p>AGOT, chapter 57, Bran.</p>

<p>Bran has conversation with <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Osha"">Osha</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Are there truly giants beyond the Wall?” he asked Osha, uncertainly.</p>
  
  <p>“Giants and worse than giants, Lordling. I tried to tell your brother
  when he asked his questions, him and your maester and that smiley boy
  Greyjoy. <strong>The cold winds are rising, and men go out from their fires
  and never come back … or if they do, they’re not men no more, but only
  wights, with blue eyes and cold black hands.</strong> Why do you think I run
  south with Stiv and Hali and the rest of them fools? <strong>Mance thinks
  he’ll fight, the brave sweet stubborn man, like the white walkers were
  no more than rangers, but what does he know? He can call himself
  King-beyond-the-Wall all he likes, but he’s still just another old
  black crow who flew down from the Shadow Tower. He’s never tasted
  winter. I was born up there, child, like my mother and her mother
  before her and her mother before her, born of the Free Folk. We
  remember.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually this passage once more confirms that Mance has not spent 20 years uniting clans, as Osha points out - <strong>He’s never tasted winter</strong>. Mance has not spent winter beyond the wall. And if we believe in Oshas words, Mance is going to fight Others. So that's your motive, if you have to fight others and wights you need an army. As to how Mance knew about others, well he might not but as Osha says <strong>We (Free Folk) remember</strong>.</p>

<p>As to why free folk attacked the Wall, I do recall Jon saying that free folk was not attacking the wall because of feud with Night's Watch, but because they were fleeing from something more terrible than swords and arrows of Night's Watch. And Mance was looking for safe house for his wife and his unborn child. I'll look in the books for direct quote and will include it later.</p>

<p>Maybe 20 years is a TV canon, but that doesn't comply with the books.</p>

<p>Besides, Tormund is not a reliable character. If Tormund is trusted then we have to believe that he has bedded bear and the bear has bitten half of his member but his member is still thrice in size compared to Mance's. Also he has spent some time in the belly of a sleeping giant and when the same giant woke up, took Tormund for her babe and suckled him for 3 moons turn. (this last paragraph is not part of the answer, but couldn't resist myself of not pointing out Tormund's exploits)</p>

"91681","How was Myrcella's betrothed really chosen?","<p>In the show, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5wecjshfbo"" rel=""noreferrer"">Tyrion devises a deception to figure out who Cersei's spy is</a>. It turned out that Pycelle was the spy, and Tyrion ended up marrying Myrcella to Dorne. But what if it turned out that Varys or Littlefinger was the spy? Was Tyrion's marriage plan for Myrcella dependent on who the rat was or was Myrcella going to be wed to Dorne no matter the circumstances? In other words, was there ever a possibility that Myrcella was going to be wed to either Theon Greyjoy or Robin Arryn?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","91695","<p>I dont think Tyrion made the marriage plans known to any other guy except Pycell. Yes, not even the prospective groom's houses. Simple reason being, if the Princess was promised to each of the 3 houses, that promised would have to be kept. So 2 of the 3 houses would turn against Lannister, which were as yet sort of neutral.  </p>

<p>Tyrion's choice of the 3 prospective houses were perfect. Dorne, Greyjoys &amp; Arryns. Dorne was resentful of the Lannister after the King's Landing sacking &amp; killing of Elia. So this betrothal would bring them back into the fold. A move of reconciliation. Greyjoys were up in rebellion &amp; declared themselves Kings. They didnt support anyone but themselves but this proposal could calm them &amp; bring them into the fold. Arryns were wary of the Lannisters after Roberts &amp; Jon Arryns death &amp; it would be good to get their support through a betrothal.  </p>

<p>These three houses were chosen because, Robb Stark &amp; Stannis were coming to Kings Landing &amp; these 3 houses were as yet neutral to both sides. So in order to tilt one of the houses in his favour, Tyrion made those choices    </p>

"91687","in ASOIAF how do Wights work?","<p>I have been watching the TV Show and read a couple books years (decades?) ago so my memory is hazy, and I've been wondering: what sort of undead are wights? </p>

<p>We know they can be killed by fire, but can they also be killed, zombie-like, by breaking their skull or other relevant body parts? </p>

<p>Also, the show often presents mostly-bones undeads, which should ""mechanically"" be unable to move much, do those appear in the books too? </p>

<p>If any body remnant can be made undead anyway, is there any point in fighting them without specialized instruments (e.g. flaming swords or arrows)?</p>

A headless wight or wight's severed arm still poses a threat. So there are no other way to kill the wight, except the fire.</p>
<p>ADWD, chapter 13, Bran. This chapter is a good source, it has all the answers for your questions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All around him, wights were rising from beneath the snow. Two, three,
four. Bran lost count. They surged up violently amidst sudden clouds
of snow. Some wore black cloaks, some ragged skins, some nothing.
<strong>All of them had pale flesh and black hands. Their eyes glowed like pale blue starts.</strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Bran filled a fist with snow and threw it, but the wight did bot so
much as blink. A black hand fumbled at his face, another at his belly.
Its fingers felt like iron. He's going to pull my guts out. But
suddenly Summer was between them. Bran glimpsed skin tear like cheap
cloth, heard the splintering of bone. <strong>He saw a hand and wrist rip
loose</strong>, pale fingers wriggling, the sleeve faded black roughspun.
Black, he thought, he's wearing black, he was one of the Watch. Summer
flung the arm aside, twisted, and sank his teeth into the dead man;s
neck under the chin. When the big grey wolf wrenched free, he took
most of the creature's throat out in an explosion of pale rotten meat.
<strong>The severed hand was still moving. Bran rolled away from it</strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&quot;Hoooodor&quot; came whimper, from somewhere down below. And suddenly he
was not Bran, the broken boy crawling through the snow, suddenly he
was Hodor halfway down the hill, with the wight raking at his eyes.
Roaring, he came lurching to his feet, throwing the thing violently
aside. It went to one knee, began to rise again. Bran ripped Hodor's
longsword from his belt. Deep inside he could hear poor Hodor
whimpering still, but outside he was seven feet of fury with old iron
in his hand. He raised the sword and brought it down upon the dead
man, grunting as the blade sheared through wet wool and rusted mail
and rotted leather, biting deep into the bones and flesh beneath.
&quot;Hodor!&quot; he bellowed, and slashed again. <strong>This time he took the
wight's head off at the nek, and for a half moment he exulted... until
a pair of dead hands came groping blindly for his throat.</strong></p>

"91722","Just how many White Walkers are there?","<p>I do recall a few instances throughout the series/books where they describe the armies of the White Walkers, but as far as I can recall I was under the impression that the vast majority would be comprised of wights, rather than White Walkers themselves.</p>

<p>Are there descriptions or discussions that take place that give any insight to how many actual WW there are?</p>

<p>We do see how one is made in the tv series, but with the age at which that occurs I am lead to believe there is either an age acceleration process that infants also undertake (they have all looked ancient as shown in the tv show) or they are taken somewhere to grow up and don't get enlisted in the army until they are 'of age', or something similar.</p>

<li>He dislikes most Fantasy names (e.g. Riznakh)</li>
<li>He has tried many methods of name creation</li>
<li>Including those funny online name generators</li>
<li>Baby name books</li>
<li>He wants his names to be meaningful</li>

<li>This can be based on whether the person is &quot;important&quot; or not, ethnicity / exoticness within the story, etc</li>
<li>He bases his names on existing or historical figures, but usually gives them a slight twist so as to sound realistic and relatable</li>
<li>John becomes Jon, Edward becomes Eddard, etc.</li>

"22702","What is the shape of the world of Westeros and do the Westerosi know?","<p>For quite some time now I have been asking myself how the world of <em>Game of Thrones</em> is shaped and if the people living in that world know the shape. </p>

<p>In questions here on SciFi.Stackexchange concerning the unnatural seasons or the definition of a year in Westeros, it is often <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/22701/2037"">argued</a> that the Westerosi can measure the duration of a revolution of their planet around the sun. But that only works if they know that they actually live on a planet. </p>

<p>In <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/3557/2037"">this</a> answer it was said that people have been travelling in ships around the world. However, I cannot remember any passage in the books supporting this. Actually I only remember evidence for the opposite: </p>

<ol>
<li>During the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Feast_for_Crows-Chapter_19"" rel=""noreferrer"">Kingsmoot</a> on the Iron Islands, there is a man called <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Gylbert_Farwynd"" rel=""noreferrer"">Gylbert Farwynd</a> who promises the Ironborn treasures from lands far to the west, if they elect him as king. However, the POV character of that chapter (I think it was Victarion Greyjoy) does not believe him and sees the madness in Gylbert's eyes - as if speaking of travelling west is crazy. </li>
<li>Later when he leads the attack against the Shield Islands, the Iron Fleet travels out of sight of the coast line. This manoeuvre is considered very dangerous and risky. If this is already dangerous, traveling even further west appears close to suicide.</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition, there was a <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Brandon_Stark_%28Shipwright%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">Brandon Stark</a> who sailed to the far west and never returned.</p>

<p><a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/3547/does-the-song-of-ice-and-fire-take-place-in-a-hollow-world"">A prior thread on this site</a> establishes that the world is not a hollow world, but is not conclusive as to whether it is a planet.</p>

<p>Is there any evidence in the books that the World of Ice and Fire is a planet? Was it established that the Westerosi know the nature of their world?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","50041","<p>George RR Martin confirmed in a <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1206/"">recent interview</a> that the world of Westeros <strong>is round</strong>, etc albeit slightly larger than our own.</p>

Every step of that north-side trek would be in danger from White Walkers, and then there's the risk that Ser Alliser (or someone else) might just say ""I see no Night's Watch, just Wildlings. Jon Snow must be dead."" while all Jon can do is look up, since there's little chance of being heard (or at least little chance of being understood). South of the Wall, it's also a long trek but there's a 700 foot high wall in between them and the White Walkers, so they're not in danger of attack every step of the journey. <em>Which I thought was why they had taken ships</em>. </p>

"161207","How can Sansa Stark be forced to marry?","<p>In the sixth episode in season three ""The Climb"", Sansa Stark is set to marry Loras Tyrell, but is told by Tyrion that he is to marry her. We do know this is not what she wants at all as she is crying when what seems to be Loras Tyrell's ship sailing away.</p>

<p>What I don't understand is,</p>

<ul>
<li>She is still a child even though she has ""Flowered"" (Tryion says this
when protesting the arrangement to his father), I would imagine being the same as an under-aged person in current times</li>
<li>Being that her Mother is still alive at this time, it would only be
logical that she is the only one who could decide who her daughter
was to marry</li>
<li>Being that she is captive, being made to get married under duress
would not make the marriage official , which would mean Tyrion
Lannister would have no claim to the North</li>
<li>That they are married before the Gods, if is was forced, would the
church accept it as official.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>So with those reasons stated, how can Sansa be forced to marry and have it stand as an official marriage?</strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","161217","<p>You need to understand the point and strength of a king. The king of the land can force through basically anything he wants, re-writing history if he so chooses, and all subjects of the king submit to his will, or you deny his rule, and so are acting in rebellion. </p>

<p>It really doesn't matter what Sansa's say in the matter is (or her parents, or anybody's except the kings say in the matter), or whether she was married once ""flowered"" or betrothed to someone her parents didn't agree with from the moment of her birth. </p>

<p>The only reason kings don't go full despot on their subjects is doing so tends to incite rebellion (as seen with why Robert Baratheon leads a rebellion in the first place). The North is already in open revolt, so the Lannisters (who are controlling Joffrey right now) don't need to worry about what they think, and are using Joffrey's power as the king to cement a claim to Winterfell through marriage (and eventually a half-Lannister, half-Stark child).</p>

<p>Now if the king were to fall, any other King could choose to undo the marriage (as they could do if any subject was forced to get married and they didn't agree with the decision), but the point is that all decisions are subject to whomever can enforce them.</p>

<p>It may well be that there would be people in the North who would never accept a marriage of Sansa that Ned or Caitlyn didn't agree to, but unless they overthrow the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms, there's nothing they can do but submit to his decision.</p>

<p>I have only watched the TV series, I'm sure this was explained in the books more clearly, and that both diverge in some respects. If it is possible, I would prefer an explanation that works from the perspective of the series and I would also like to know the explanation offered in the books. </p>
","<game-of-thrones>","92670","<p>Actually, the Lord Commander DOES have the power to relieve someone of their oath. In fact, the Lord Commander and the King are the only two men who can do so. When asked that very question in an online chat, GRRM responded thusly:</p>

  the nightwatch?</p>
  
  <p><strong>George_RR_Martin:</strong> The great council would have released Aemon from his
  maester's oath, so I suppose it would be possible. With an appropriate
  authority.</p>

<p>However, in this case, that wouldn't be necessary. Sam would be attending The Citadel to become the Maester for the Night's Watch, which is perfectly acceptable. Upon his graduation, Sam would be expected to return to Castle Black and resume his duties (unless otherwise noted).</p>

  <p><strong>Maester Aemon:</strong> I am a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to

  You must make that choice yourself, and live with it for the rest of
  your days — as I have.</p>

<p>As others have mentioned, it's also not unusual for a Night's Watch brother to be away from The Wall on temporary assignment, which is basically what Sam's time at The Citadel would be. Brothers of the Watch are often sent on recruitment drives to King's Landing and other large cities, as well as supply runs &amp; ""funding"" drives.

"92757","Which book, if any, continues the storyline after the season 5 finale?","<p>The game of thrones season 5 finale 'killed me' and I would like to read the books for the remaining part of the story. </p>

<p>Could anyone who has read the books and watched the show as well tell me which book should I start reading first so I can read what happens after ( season 5 episode 10 in the tv show). </p>

<p>I actually thought of starting it from the beginning since buying 5 books is a little expensive for me at the moment.</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","92760","<p>In most cases, the television show has already reached the point where the most recent novel (<em>A Dance with Dragons</em>) has left off; the finale on Season 5 lines up pretty cleanly with the end of that novel. (In some cases, like Bran, the show ran out of story <em>last</em> season). </p>

<p>In other cases, the show has deviated quite a bit from the novels, especially with Sansa, Arya, and Tyrion.</p>

<p>In either case, it's been made pretty clear at this point that the producers on the show are going to need to diverge from the novels from this point forward. </p>

<p>While I strongly recommend you read the books, starting with <em>A Game of Thrones</em> and in order, you aren't going to find anything ""beyond"" the TV Show in them. It <em>will</em> fill in some extra details, especially about the backstory of some of the characters. In addition, Martin is currently writing the next book, <em>Winds of Winter</em>, which he plans to release ""before Season 6"". However, I'm not sure how much of what going into the books from here on out will really come into play in the show.</p>

<p>In short: you should read the books because they're good books and you'll probably enjoy them. Just don't read them expecting to ""get a head start"" on the show, or you may be disappointed.</p>

"92776","How do Southern people discern Night's Watch deserters from truthful brothers sent south?","<p>Night's Watch deserters are sentenced to death, as we've seen in the very first episode of Game of Thrones.
A man dressed all in black is apprehended by Stark men and brought before Lord Eddard Stark.
Lord Stark sees him as a deserter and sentences him to die (and then executes that death penalty).</p>

<p>However, there are men of the Night's Watch south of the Wall, on a legitimate mission or on some kind of allowed leave.
For instance, we have Benjen Stark visiting Winterfell when the king and his party is there.
There is also Yoren, who travels around Westeros in search of new recruits.</p>

<p>I could imagine that the Warden of the North (and other lords in the northern part of Westeros) would have a good idea of who would be allowed further south and whose appearance would raise suspicion.
But I reckon the southern lords don't have as many visits from the Night's Watch, so they might not know who would be allowed to be there and who wouldn't.</p>

<p>How would lords who are rather unfamiliar with the specific brothers of the Night's Watch discern deserters from brothers sent out for some reason?</p>

<p>That ends my question, but there is a spoiler from the <strong>season 5 finale</strong> that continues the question a bit more:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Sam is sent to Oldtown to become a Maester, so he can replace Maester Aemon at Castle Black.
 But he is riding together with Gilly (a woman!) and her baby (a baby!), which might raise a lot of suspicion from people who don't know what he is sent out to do.
 What prevents southern lords of sentencing Sam as a deserter from the Night's Watch?</p>
</blockquote>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","92781","<p>As mentioned in comments, a Night's Watch brother on official business could have a document authorising him to leave the Wall, bearing the Lord Commander's seal.</p>

<p>To be clear, a sealed medieval document does not have to be sealed <em>shut</em>. It was common to <a href=""https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/manuscriptsandspecialcollections/researchguidance/medievaldocuments/authentication.aspx"">affix a seal</a> to the bottom of a document on a ribbon, as in this example:</p>

<p><img src=""https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/ManuscriptsandSpecialCollections/Images-Multimedia/ResearchGuidance/ReadingMedievalDocuments/RAO12-Ne-D-3846.jpg"" alt=""Document with attached seal""></p>

<p>The people the brother met (including nobles) might be illiterate. However, they <em>would</em> be able to recognise the picture on seal of the Lord Commander -- which would be particularly well known in the North.</p>

<p>As for what happens in the South: Night's Watch deserters are much more likely to be found in the North. It's a very long way from the Wall to King's Landing -- and any deserters who get that far would probably manage to steal some clothes along the way, so they are no longer wearing Night's Watch black.</p>

<p>So, authorities in the South don't have much reason to be suspicious of travellers dressed entirely in black -- any such people they encounter are likely to be Night's Watch brothers on official business, not deserters.</p>

  <p><em>Stone eyes are blind eyes</em>, thought Tyrion. The mortal form of greyscale began in the extremities, he knew: a tingling in a fingertip, a toenail turning black, a loss of feeling. As the numbness crept into the hand, or stole past the foot and up the leg, the flesh stiffened and grew cold and the victim's skin took on a greyish hue, resembling stone. <strong>He had heard it said that there were three good cures for greyscale: axe and sword and cleaver. Hacking off afflicted parts did sometimes stop the spread of the disease, Tyrion knew, but not always</strong>. Many a man had sacrificed one arm or foot, only to find the other going grey. Once that happened, hope was gone. Blindness was common when the stone reached the face. In the final stages the curse turned inward, to muscles, bones, and inner organs.</p>

<p>Why? What are the chances that the Wildlings are going to agree to come with the leader of their oldest enemy? I would think he would never make it back alive and he almost didn't.

<p>If they try to kill him here and succeed you would think that however many Wildlings were there would do something about it. i.e. attack the wall, yeah they had women and children but I doubt that the Nights Watch would have been able to fend off that many. Also witnesses.</p>

<p>The strangest thing for me is that there are no guards protecting Cersei during this episode! What exactly happened to them?</p>

<p>After seeing the events in the Season 5 finale, it just seems like a very convenient coincidence for them to meet in such a way.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","93014","<p>First, a man who helps Arya in season 2  is not necessarily also a man training her in season 5. A man may have many faces, and a face of no-one may appear on many men. It is known.</p>

<p>Whatever a man intends to do, it appears more complex than simply helping a girl become no-one.</p>

<p>And there's yet another layer to the mystery. A few things we learn about those dungeon black cells in the books, mostly in AFFC:</p>

<ul>
<li>The man in charge of them (therefore, in charge of  keeping Jaqen imprisoned), Rugen,  was a mysterious character, ""no friends, no kin"", ""The other turnkeys were afraid of him"", ""was seldom here"", ""came and went as he pleased"". He appeared under mad Aerys (not long after Aerys hired Varys), and disappeared after Tyrion's escape (leaving behind a coin that caused Cersei to suspect the Tyrells were behind this)</li>
<li>Jaime, while  pretending to ""investigate"" Tyrion's ""mysterious"" disappearance, appears to know  some secret about who he really is:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Rugen"" the old man supplied. ""An undergaoler. He had charge of the
  third level, the black cells."" </p>
  
  <p>""Tell me of him,"" Jaime had to say. A
  bloody farce. <strong>He knew who Rugen was, even if [this old man] did not.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Very few people were kept in the cells (quote from the above old man):</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>...we had Grand Maester Pycelle for a time, and before him Lord Stark the
  traitor. There were three others, common men, but Lord Stark gave them
  to the Night's Watch. I did not think it good to free those three, but
  the papers were in proper order</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Those three are clearly Jaqen, Rorge and Biter - and the timing of that last point doesn't quite add up. Ned was dismissed the day after Yoren arrived late at night looking for ""scum"" to recruit from the dungeons.  Doing the paperwork over breakfast that morning doesn't seem right, and nor does doing it after his  reinstatement. Even if Ned had had time to, he'd have been unlikely to judge Rorge and Biter worthy of becoming brothers to his brother. Did someone else (Rugen perhaps?) forge the papers sending  these three dangerous men north?</li>
<li>Rugen's description also precisely matches that of the ""grizzled"", stubbly gaoler Varys disguises himself as in AGOT when visiting Ned in the black cells...</li>
</ul>

<p>Yeah,  we can safely assume that Rugen is one of Varys's disguises. </p>

<p>This means Varys was in control of the black cells.</p>

<p><strong>This  suggests, Jaqen was essentially Varys's prisoner - <em>or  his guest</em>.</strong> </p>

<p>Alongside a cannibal and a twisted sadist. An interesting selection of guests... </p>

<p>It makes sense that a master assassin making investigations would cross paths with that city's master spy - and whether they decide to be enemies or allies, they will want to keep a close eye on each other.</p>

<p>I've also always thought that a black cell with an unlocked door and a cooperative master spy jailer, connected to a secret network of tunnels, would be a convenient base for an assassin to conduct investigations. And it'd explain why Rorge and Biter were terrified of him, if he habitually escapes, <em>then comes back</em>.</p>

<p>Varys would have been able to prevent Yoren taking them, had he wanted to, and may have gone as far as forging the paperwork to have Yoren take them north.</p>

<p>Why? A user does not know... but it adds an interesting dimension to the mystery. </p>

Ok, so to begin with, <strong><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Cersei_Lannister"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cersei</a></strong> still has some outstanding charges against her, which simply won't go away:</p>

<ul>
<li>Adultery</li>
<li>Fornication</li>
<li>Incest</li>
<li>Regicide</li>
</ul>

<p>She <em>could</em> order everyone to be killed, but the problem is that these are charges laid upon her by <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Faith_of_the_Seven"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Faith</a>. In the Westerosi custom, The Faith is still an extremely important part of their culture.</p>

<p>You saw the way that the ""smallfolk"" (commoners) behaved towards her during her Walk of Shame. Now imagine if she was to order the death of like hundreds even thousands of people. There would be outrage and ""the many"" (smallfolk) would realise that they can stand-up against ""the few"" (the Lords).</p>

<p><strong>The easiest road</strong><br>
Now, at this point, all she has to do, is name a Champion, who would defend her. And given that her champion seems to be <strong><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Robert_Strong"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ser Robert Strong</a></strong>, who is a humongous Knight, theorised to be</p>

<p>who would most likely defeat <em>any</em> known or probably even any possible champions for The Faith, and just be done with all of her problems in one go.</p>

<p><strong>It's a huge gamble</strong>, but Cersei is insanely over-confident and well, just plain, <em>insane</em>. (but she's not so insane as to kill everybody). And given that the outcome of a Trial By Combat is binding, once her champion wins, she is no longer to be pestered by these accusations.

<p>In the book he's not the one who forced her to do that. It was her father.</p>

<p>As to whether Robin is his son--I doubt that. It's possible, but unlikely, namely because the chance of discovery if they had an affair was too high. And, it's better for him if the heir is legit.</p>

<p>By the time Sweet Robin was spawned, Baelish was much more cautious, and while he might hold out the idea of love to Lysa, it was possible that he didn't actually have sex with her. A legitimate heir is better for him.</p>

<p>But no. <strong>Baelish never did hint or say that Robin was his secret son (and neither did Lysa for that matter, and she was nuts enough to spill any large truth before she went bye-bye out the door).</strong> That is not to say the possibility does not exist, just that it hasn't been laid out this way. Lysa's fervent belief that ""the seed is strong"" referred to Jon's son tracks with that.  </p>

<p>In the show, it is not explicitly explained how Joffrey was poisoned. Whether it was the wine or the cake.</p>

<p>But in season 4 episode 6, Pycell presents Sansa's necklace as a proof in the trial against Tyrion. Since Sansa was wearing the necklace throughout the wedding &amp; nobody but Olenna goes up near her for a small talk, there would be no time to mix the poison in the pigeon pie (cake). Hence, conclusively &amp; certainly, the poison was mixed in the wine.</p>

<p>Littlefinger &amp; Olenna were directly involved. Olenna confessed to it in front of Margery in episode 4. Ser Dontos was hired to transfer the poison onto the unsuspecting Sansa.</p>

<p>If you go back to episode 2, you can clearly identify the point at which Olenna takes the poison from Sansa's necklace &amp; puts it in Joffrey's wine.</p>

"162097","Why did the Boltons burn Winterfell?","<p>At the end of Season 2/beginning of Season 3, Ramsay Bolton and his men burn Winterfell after the Iron Born (other than Theon) run away. But why?</p>

<p>If Roose Bolton was already planning his betrayal of the Starks, he knew he would be making a play for Winterfell so why burn his future castle?</p>

<p>And if Roose Bolton was not already planning his betrayal of the Starks, the burning is even more puzzling as it is treasonous to the King in the North.</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","162117","<p>You are correct Bolton was already planning that. Given Robb's constant blunders, He was certain that North was doomed to be defeated eventually and he didn't plan on being on the losing side. Jaime turning up at Harrenhal gave him the opportunity to pull his master-stroke, getting on the good side of Tywin Lannister.</p>

<p>There would be several reasons for burning however. </p>

<ol>
<li>Boltons weren't sure that their plan would work (Re: the Red Wedding). It was still a military plan and thing about military plans is that things rarely go according to the plan. Destroying Stark seat and stronghold would have been great in event of something backfiring and an open war with the Stark.</li>
<li>Burning Winterfell helped them hide any possible evidence e.g. Dead bodies of all the Ironborn, their stuff, their banners, the bodies of all the witnesses and any survivors who maybe hiding somewhere which would have proved that unlike their story that Ironborn burnt the Castle, it was actually them who did that. (Evidently this failed as they did not take the Crypts into account or Godswood, both of which were used by the survivors).<sup>1</sup></li>
<li>Ramsay is a sadistic monster who just takes pleasure in misery of others. It would have amused him to see the Castle where he was imprisoned and kept as a servant to burn. He is the kind of person who would do it just for the heck of it. </li>
<li>Stark-Bolton enmity goes back to thousands of years. Both claimed Kingship. Bolton Kings are said to have flayed many Stark Kings and worn their skins as cloaks. Eventually the Starks prevailed. This could be a payback for that defeat which reduced the Boltons from Kings to Lords. In any case, burning Winterfell is in line with the Bolton traditions. Kings Royce II and Royce IV Bolton did the same.</li>
</ol>

<p><sub><strong>1.</strong> Many key logical factors like this one are missing from the Show due to their time and focus constraints. Which in turn gives birth to such questions by Show-fans. In the Books, Ironborn didn't abandon Theon. They were all killed by Ramsay. It was Ser Rodrik Cassel who had Winterfell and Ironborn besieged.
The Boltons attacked Cassel and killed him and his men. So given the size of massacre, it would have been evident something grand had happened. Therefore they needed to destroy the evidence and make it look like it was the Ironborn who did it. In the Show, they didn't show the Wex Pyke either. He was Theon's squire and hid in the God's Woods. He's the main source of how Northmen learnt that Bran was still alive and Boltons were in league with Freys and Lannisters. Plus it was Ramsay who later took it as his personal seat, not Roose Bolton.
 Seat of House Bolton remained Dreadfort. Ramsay claimed Winterfell for his own by virtue of his marriage to <em>Arya Stark</em>.</sub></p>

"93508","Which of the great houses of Westeros are standing at the end of season five/ADWD? [Spoilers included]","<p>It seems to me that all the great houses that were considered great at the start of the first book/season have practically wiped off the main branch.

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> both Margy and Loras are rotting in a dungeon. With a possible chance of meeting Ned Stark real soon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>How many Great Houses didn't have their heirs decimated and main branch pruned by the GRRM Reaper, at this point of the story?</strong></p>

<p>(I am aware that there might be differences between the show and the book. I'm interested in both, if possible. I also don't consider the Targaryans that great either.)</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","93514","<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Many of the <strong>big name</strong> Houses are, as you point out, not in great shape anymore. But there are more Great Houses than you probably realized, and not all of them are doing badly. A handful of them are on the verge of going extinct, but just as many are still going strong, and possibly improved their position recently.</p>

<hr>

<p>If we use the typical definition of a Great House as being a House which has it's own vassal houses, then there are nine that still existed at some point during:</p>

<h2>The Good</h2>

<p>On the one hand, a couple of the Great Houses look to be getting along just fine, and if anything, have improved their position during the War of the Five Kings:</p>

<p><strong>House Martell:</strong> In the books, Prince Doran has three children: Arianne, Quentyn, and Trystane, and by Dornish Law, Arianne is the heir to the throne, which I assume means she would keep the Martell name. </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Quentyn, unfortunately, is dead by dragon accident. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the show, they skipped the first two kids and went right for Trystane, who's heir to Sunspear. In both cases, he has been happily betrothed to Myrcella Baratheon, the King's elder sister, for most of the series.</p>

<p><strong>House Bolton:</strong> Thanks to their alliance with the Lannisters, Roose Bolton not only gets promoted to Great House (supplanting the Starks and taking their former sworn houses), he also has a legitimate heir in Ramsay. As Ramsay is now married, the line should continue through him:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> with Sansa Stark in the show, or Jeyne Pool (fake Arya Stark), in the novels; both have managed to escape at this point, however, so Ramsay may be out of luck.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If not Ramsay, then Roose's wife is pregnant, so there's another possible heir on the way.</p>

<p><strong>House Frey:</strong> Walder Frey has a nearly endless supply of male heirs waiting in line, and there's already a second generation heir - Ryman Frey, son of Stevron Frey. </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> In the novels, Stevron's already dead, and his son is heir.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>House Greyjoy:</strong> Their situation is currently sketchy; I initially put them in the ""Bad Off"" category, but I realized there's some things we don't know about Ironborn culture that could make difference. King Euron has no legitimate heirs, though he has plenty of bastards, but it's not clear how much that matters to the Iron Island. If he could legitimize any of his children by his salt wives, that would rescue House Greyjoy pretty nicely.</p>

<p>Theon, for his part, is no use: even if were still considered the heir to House Greyjoy, he won't be fathering any children in the near future. Asha/Yara's whereabouts on TV are unclear, but in the novel she is currently</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> married off to another House <em>and</em> held captive by Stannis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so she's no help either.</p>

<h2>The Bad</h2>

<p>Most of the Great Houses, on the other hand, have started falling apart. The list of these includes:</p>

<p><strong>House Stark:</strong> No longer technically a House at all, the Starks are dead as far as the world is concerned. There is still a chance they could recover, though. There's suspicion that Robb may have legitimized Jon Snow before he died, and we also know that Bran and Rickon are both alive. If any of those three manages to survive the rest of the series and take back Winterfell, they could rebuild their House. Of course, this is Martin, so I wouldn't put money on it.</p>

<p><strong>House Arryn:</strong> The heir to House Arryn is Robyn, who's frail and sickly and, IMO, not likely to survive very long in the real world. Petyr Baelish has managed to essentially supplant House Arryn as ruler of The Vale, as part of his plan to do whatever it is Littlefinger's really up to.</p>

<p><strong>House Lannister:</strong> This one's in complete shambles, ironically enough. The Tywin branch of this family is basically over: Jaime, by law, cannot marry (he's a Kingsguard), Tyrion's been disowned and wanted for murder, and none Tywin's grandchildren are named Lannister. Kevan's branch isn't any better: two of his children are dead and the third is Lancel, who's basically renounced any claim to nobility. (This is far more explicit in the novel: he abandons his wife and forfeits his newly-acquired land to join the penitents.)</p>

<p><strong>House Tyrell:</strong> is an interesting case: in the novels, they are doing just fine; on the show, they're on brink of extinction. </p>

<p>In the novels, three of Mace Tyrell's sons are alive and healthy, plus his uncle Moryn has several generations of children on his own. They're in no danger of dying out any time soon.</p>

<p>On TV, though, the character cutbacks mean that Mace Tyrell has only one son, Loras. While he's been released from his Kingsguard oath to Renly, it's debatable if he's ever going to produce an heir. His open homosexuality isn't really an issue: as Margaery proved with Renly, if there's a will, there's a way. The bigger problem is his betrothal to Cersei: she has every intention of getting out of that betrothal, and even if she can't, she's already proven more than willing to keep her husband childless out of spite. </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> That's assuming he's not killed by the High Sparrow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Best case, IMO, Loras gets out of his betrothal to Cersei and finds someone else willing to ""adapt"" to his lifestyle long enough to have a son (or, alternatively, fake it like Cersei did with her children).</p>

<p><strong>House Tully:</strong> Like House Stark, there is no longer technically a ""House Tully"", but they're in slightly better condition otherwise. The current heir, Edmure, is still alive and married, so there's still a chance for him to bear a son. Hoster's brother Brynden is also still alive, as far as we know.</p>

<h2>The Ugly</h2>

<p>Finally, in a bit of a class all it's own:</p>

<p><strong>House Baratheon:</strong> As far as the ""real"" Baratheons are concerned, this house is on its last legs. In the novels, Stannis is making an attempt to take back the North and, from there, Westeros from the Lannister's allies, but he's already getting desperate. In the show, </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> this branch of the family line is all dead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Legally, though, House Baratheon still rules in Westeros, as Tommen is officially Robert's son. We know that he's not, and we can probably guess that Cersei would be elated if she could find a way to use the Lannister name instead, but that's unlikely to ever happen. Being young, healthy, and married, the Baratheon line will probably continue through Tommen. After a few generations, rumors of his illegitimacy would become just a blip in their history -- assuming he's not remembered as the Baratheon that lost the Iron Throne.</p>

"93560","Can fire kill (or harm) a dragon?","<p>We all remember Daenerys's quote right after Viserys's death (Season 1 episode 6: <strong>""A Golden Crown""</strong>, and A Game of Thrones chapter <strong>Daenerys V</strong>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He was no dragon. Fire cannot kill a dragon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, are we sure that this is true? Can a dragon be killed/harmed by fire?</p>

<p>We know that a lot of dragons died during the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Doom_of_Valyria"">Doom of Valyria</a>, the cataclysm of an unspecified nature which did contain a lot of fire.
In <em>The World of Ice &amp; Fire</em>, there is a picture of dragon with fire on his back with the description <em>A dragon burning during the Doom.</em>.
It doesn't say this dragon died because of the fire, but it does prove that dragons can burn (unless we attribute this to the unreliable narrator).</p>

<p>On the other hand, dragons <em>breathe</em> fire and they seem unharmed by their own fiery breath.
Also, Daenerys hatched her dragons in pyre and that did not harm her newly-hatched dragons.</p>

<p>So was the fire during the Doom of Valyria simply much hotter than regular fire, and is that the reason it could hurt dragons?
Or did the fire during the Doom of Valyria not hurt the dragons, but did they die of other causes (e.g. debris flying around)?</p>

<p>As a side, could a dragon harm/kill another dragon with its fiery breath?
Is there any example of this, for instance during <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dance_of_the_Dragons"">the Dance of the Dragons</a>?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","93567","<p><strong>The Doom</strong><br>
It is widely believed that the Doom was a cataclysm which involved hundreds (and perhaps thousands) of volcanoes.</p>

<p>These volcanoes are speculated to have been the main cause of the downfall of these dragons.</p>

<p>See, the dragons <em>are</em> immune to fire, <strong>up to a certain point</strong>. In general, the younger they are, the less resilient they are, also their own fire is weaker in comparison to older dragons.</p>

<p><strong>The Dance</strong><br>
It is probably safe to assume that the dragons involved in The Dance of The Dragons were not affected by each others' fire. Most of them were fully grown and extremely old dragons - the likes of <strong>Caraxes</strong>, <strong>Meraxes</strong>, <strong>Vhagar</strong>, <strong>Sunfyre</strong> and <strong>Balerion the Black Dread</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>History</strong><br>
It is true that generally [Targaryen] dragons have died a violent death, this is especially true given that they were used extensively for war purposes, but there has been no known occurrence of dragons burning each other to death during any of these conflicts.<br>
Although, there are some clear examples of dragons burning each other, as exemplified in <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/93560/can-fire-kill-or-harm-a-dragon/93908#93908"">the answer privided by PrisonMonkeys</a>; killing one is a whole different story. </p>

<p>At best all we know is that their weakness is their age (the younger they are, the less resilient) and their eyes (if you were to poke one in the eye, it would probably hurt them as much as it hurts you).</p>

<p><strong>The Cannibal</strong><br>
<a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Cannibal"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Cannibal</a> was the eldest of three ""wild"" dragons living around Dragonstone, he was rumoured to have been a ""cannibal"" in that he consumed other dragons; however there is no evidence that it burned them prior to consumption.</p>

<p><strong>The Phrase</strong><br>
Logically, many people, especially Targaryens themselves attribute themselves to having dragon-like properties, which includes immunity to fire. This clearly stems from the fact that if dragons can't be burned, and Targaryens think that <em>they</em> are dragons, then they also must be immune.</p>

<p>This is where Dany's mistake comes in; she is repeatedly taught that Targaryens are dragons, etc, by her idiotic<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> brother, Viserys. This makes her think that she is immune to fire<sup><strong>2</strong></sup>; when in-fact <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/37473/21267""><strong>they are not</strong></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Where to from here?</strong><br>
So let's say you wanted to have a dragon barbecue; what you would need is a nice Mt. Doom level volcano and all you have to do is chuck the dragon in there.</p>

<hr />

<p><sup>
<strong>1.</strong> In Viserys' defence, he himself has had very little education, and has been jaded and blinded by his ambition to restore his family to the Throne.<br /><br />
<strong>2.</strong> She also mistakenly believes that she is immune to sickness, which may prove to be a grave assumption for her.

</ul></li>
<li><p>Let's come back down to earth and dig a little bit closer to home. Robert had many baseborn children<sup><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Robert_I_Baratheon#Known_bastards"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">[5]</a></sup>, a few of which were <strong>acknowledged</strong> by him, including <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Edric_Storm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Edric Storm</strong></a> and <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Mya_Stone"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Mya Stone</strong></a>. Mya is the <strong>eldest</strong> of his bastards, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Gendry"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Gendry</strong></a> is the eldest <strong>male</strong> but Edric is the eldest <strong>acknowledged male</strong> (and is also the most <em>lordly</em>, having been grown up at <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Storm%27s_End"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Storm's End</a> under the care of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Cortnay_Penrose"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Ser Cortnay Penrose</strong></a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>If these bastards are allowed to be in line, then they can probably continue the Baratheon lineage nicely, given that they are all such strong embodiments of Robert's characteristics and the ""Baratheon look"".</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>If it were up to me, I'd go with <strong>Edric Storm</strong> (being that he is the most lordly), but it could easily go to our favourite bastard, <strong>Gendry The Bull</strong>!</p>

"93826","Is there any evidence to categorically confirm Cersei's children are bastards?","<p>I'm interested to know whether there is actually any evidence that Joffrey, Tommen or Myrcella are actually bastards? Of course, it's known that Jaime and Cersei had sex, but I can't remember anything in the books or show that proves that Robert was not the father, other than the hair colour of Cersei's children compared to his baseborn children.</p>

<p>Given that paternity tests, presumably, aren't a thing in the world of GoT, if Cersei is found guilty by the faith that she has laid with her brother, I'm still really not sure how it would remove Tommen from the throne. Sure, you can't guarantee he's the legitimate heir but you can't disprove it either.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","93881","<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>:That depends on who's the one looking for evidence. There's no doubt for us, the reader, that the three children are Jaime's. For the people within the universe of the show, things are murkier. For the High Sparrow's part, the best he can do is heresay and circumstantial evidence, though it would likely be enough to find her guilty anyway.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Outside Perspective</h2>

<p><em>We</em>, the readers/viewers, know for sure that the children are Jaime's, because Cersei admitted to Ned Stark that she made sure of it. She only ever permitted Robert to impregnate her one time, and that child died. Thereafter, she took measures to ensure that it never happened again, mostly involving never sleeping with him if she could help it.</p>

<p>Cersei would certainly know whether or not the children could have been conceived by Robert just based on her having slept with him soon before she got pregnant. So, we can safely take her word for it when she says this.</p>

<p>Beyond that, we've seen more than enough points of view from Cersei and/or Jaime to know that they both genuinely believe the children to be theirs, and again, if anyone would know, it would be them.</p>

<h2>Those In-The-Know</h2>

<p>Similarly, there's a select group of people within the novels that know the truth for certain, again because Cersei or Jaime told them. I go into details in the answer to <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/59466/who-knows-the-real-parentage-of-cerseis-children"">this question</a> but the list is pretty short; the only ones left alive, to my knowledge, are  Cersei, Jaime, and Tyrion. Both Ned and Catelyn Stark also knew the truth before their deaths, and in the TV Show, Tywin and Myrcella also finds out. </p>

<p>There are also people who have very strong suspicions, like Tywin (in the novels) and Kevan Lannister, and I'm also put money on people like Varys and Littlefinger having good sources. Many of these people have made off-hand remarks about Jaime being the father, to Cersei's face, and not been corrected, so their suspicions were effectively confirmed. </p>

<h2>Everyone Else</h2>

<p>As far as the general public goes, the only real evidence they have is the same evidence that led Jon Arryn and Ned Stark to discover the truth in the first place: basic genetics. Specifically, the ""look"" of the Baratheon line is apparently made up of several very dominant traits, primarily the dark hair color.</p>

<p>There is a book detailing the lineage of all of the Great Houses back many generations; prompted by an off-hand remark by Sansa, Ned digs around in this book and learns that <em>every single</em> Baratheon child in recorded history has had dark hair; this includes all of Robert's bastard children, but <em>not his children by Cersei</em>. Instead, those children have the golden hair common to the Lannister children, like Cersei and Jaime.</p>

<p>These days, we know enough about genetics to know that this <em>could</em> still be possible: the children could have inherited a recessive gene from Robert that he doesn't outwardly display. But even then it would be pretty persuasive: generation after generation of dark-haired children, and suddenly your fair-haired wife with the fair-haired brother gives birth the three straight fair-haired kids? </p>

<p>In the world of ASoIaF, this kind of evidence would be almost irrefutable.</p>

"24883","What were the memorable scenes in ""A Storm of Swords"" that motivated Benioff to make the adaptation?","<p>Just to be clear, this is not a ""make a list for me"" question, it is about what motivated Benioff to get on board with the <em>Game of Thrones</em>. </p>

<p>In the Wikipedia article for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_%28season_3%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Game of Thrones</em>, season 3</a>, you can read the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to Benioff, the third season will contain a particularly
  memorable scene from A Storm of Swords, the prospect of filming which
  was part of their motivation to adapt the novels for television in the
  first place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've also seen elsewhere that there are in fact two scenes. Does anyone know which scene or scenes they refer to that provided such a major influence in getting the books made into a show? The only thing that springs to mind is (spoiler ASOS)</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> The Red Wedding. Or possibly the assault on the Wall by Mance Rayder.</p>
</blockquote>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","24884","<p>The scene Benioff was talking about is almost certainly </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>The Red Wedding</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was recently revealed that there is a <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/GoT/News/Entry/Its_a_Nice_Day_For_A/"">casting call</a> for cellists ""ideally men with medieval or period faces (i.e. long hair and beards)"", as well as ""LEG ONLY, MALE AMPUTEES"" who are ""OK and comfortable with filming a scene within the context of a battle where your leg has been injured. Prosthetic makeup will be applied as though your leg has newly been severed.""</p>

<p>The Cellists make it almost certainly the aforementioned event, as music was a key part (<em>The Rains of Castamere</em>, anyone?).</p>

<p>The scene itself is one of the most heart wrenching and emotionally disturbing in the entire series, and George R.R. Martin himself has stated that the scene is <a href=""http://www.empireonline.com/interviews/interview.asp?IID=1496"">the most difficult he has ever written</a>.</p>

<p>On a personal note:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> The willingness of Martin to kill off of major characters has become one of the stand-out aspects of his writing, and the shock of realizing what has happened the first time I read it really changed my perspective on the whole series, even more so than the death of Ned Stark.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regarding the full context of the <a href=""http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/03/30/game-of-thrones-showrunners-season-2/2/"">interview with Benioff</a> referenced in the question:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> The Red Wedding seems particularly suited towards an incredibly momentous and dramatic televised scene, largely due to the tension of the wedding leading up to it, and the fact that the combat noises are drowned out by loud music.  I can easily envision bloody fight scenes interspaced with dramatic closeups of musicians furiously playing as loudly as they can, and this ties in almost exactly with the casting call descriptions cited above.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regarding the second scene mentioned, I can only speculate.  However, in addition to the other scene you mentioned in your question (which does seem a very likely candidate), I think these are just as likely, if not more:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Daenerys taking command of the army of Unsullied and turning them upon their Astaporian masters, the duel of Oberyn Martel vs. Ser Gregor Clagane, the escape of Tyrion, or possibly even the return of Catelyn Stark.</p>

"24948","Confusing movements of Lannister Armies under Jaime and Tywin?","<p>I'm currently reading A Game of Thrones for the first time and I have gotten to the point where Robb is explaining his plan at Moat Cailin. This is a highly geeky question, so I apologize in advance!</p>

<p>The problem is that I can't make sense of what Robb claims the Lannisters have been up to (p582). According to him:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Less than a fortnight past, they fought a battle in the hills below the Golden Tooth,” Robb said.</p>
  
  <p>“Uncle Edmure had sent Lord Vance and Lord Piper to hold the pass, but the Kingslayer  descended on them and put them to flight. Lord Vance was slain. The last word we had was that Lord Piper was falling back to join your brother and his other  bannermen at Riverrun, with Jaime Lannister on his heels. That’s not the worst of it, though. All the time they were battling in the pass, <strong>Lord Tywin was bringing a second Lannister army around from the south.</strong> It’s said to be even larger than Jaime’s host. </p>
  
  <p>“Father must have known that, because he sent out some men to oppose them, under the king’s own banner. He gave the command to some southron lordling, Lord Erik or Derik or something like that, but Ser Raymun Darry rode with him, and the letter said there were other knights as well, and a force of Father’s own guardsmen. Only it was a trap. <strong>Lord Derik had no sooner crossed the Red Fork than the Lannisters fell upon him, the king’s banner be damned, and Gregor Clegane took them in the rear as they tried to pull back cross the Mummer’s Ford.</strong> This Lord Derik and a few others may have escaped, no one is certain, but Ser Raymun was killed, and most of our men from Winterfell. Lord Tywin has closed off the kingsroad, it’s said, and now he’s marching <strong>north toward Harrenhal</strong>, burning as he goes.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can't make any sense of where these armies are supposed to be coming from, or where are they going?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/9xEdP.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Jaime apparently marched out of Casterly Rock, taking Vance and Piper on at Golden Tooth and forcing them to retreat towards Riverrun. That makes sense. </p>

<p>But how did the men Eddard sent from King's Landing (Lord Beric and company) to take on Tywin's army, get to the Red Fork before they were attacked? And how did Tywin's force then start heading ""north"" toward Harrenhal, when they were already north of it (at the Ruby Ford)?</p>

<p>Can anyone explain? I've probably misunderstood something. Thanks!</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><warfare><geography>","24951","<p>I think you have mixed the armies up. Lord Beric Dondarrion was not sent to oppose the Lannister forces, he was sent out to deal with Gregor Clegane, who was <em>assumed</em> to be acting on Lord Tywin's orders, though in truth no one had any proof of that. Ned Stark saw this as an attempt by Tywin to goad the Riverlords into starting the war, by taking their revenge on the westerners. I do not believe that Tywin and Gregor Clegane ever fought together, and that Dondarrion's party was ambushed by Clegane and some other force of Lannister men.</p>

<p>I believe Tywin made his way around south, like the first quote says, to close the Kingsroad north of King's Landing, and nothing else (at this point). It was, I believe, his intention to allow Clegane to roam free and not be directly associated with his atrocities.</p>

<p>So in essence: The armies are all coming from the West, Lord Tywin's and his bannermen's domains, and they are going out into the Riverlands, Tywin from the south and Jaime from the west. Clegane and Ser Amory Lorch were already there, killing and burning. Later on it is mentioned that Ser Stafford Lannister, an uncle of Jaime's, is killed with a new host of recruits at the battle of Oxcross, an army coming also from the westerlands going to the riverlands.</p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","24971","<p>I finally found an answer from Martin himself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>BHW</strong>: Why is the wall so tall?</p>
  
  <p><strong>Martin</strong>: To keep out bad things.</p>
  
  <p>Hadrian's Wall was an inspiration. In fantasy, everything is bigger. A
  friend of mine, Lisa Tuttle (we wrote Windhaven together), had just
  moved to Scotland and was giving me a tour. We were driving in her car
  and got to Hadrian's Wall at the end of the day. The tour buses were
  leaving. We walked along the top of the wall just as the sun was going
  down. It was the fall. I stood there and looked out over the hills of
  Scotland and wondered what it would be like to be a Roman centurion
  from Italy , Greece , or even Africa , covered in furs and not knowing
  what would be coming out of the north at you. I wanted to capture that
  feeling.</p>
  
  <p>Hadrian's Wall is impressive, but it's not really tall. A good ladder
  would be all you need to scramble right on over it. When you're doing
  fantasy, it has to be bigger than in real life. The castles are
  grander. Fantasy is painted in larger scale and brighter colors.</p>

"233036","Is Arya Stark the heir to House Whent?","<p><a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/213339/89104"">This says</a> that <a href=""https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/House_Whent"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">House Whent</a> maybe went extinct. The Whent family was wiped out enough during the War of the Five Kings for their lands to be given away to Janos Slynt as a gift for his help in betraying Ned Stark.</p>
<p>Known members of the house are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lord Walter Whent and Lady Shella Whent, who died without heirs.</li>
<li>Oswell Whent, who died during Robert's Rebellion. He was Walter Whent's younger brother.</li>
<li>Lasy Minisa Whent, who died during the birth of Edmure Tully. Minisa Whent married Hoster Tully and gave birth to three children: Catelyn, Lysa, and Edmure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Catelyn is the oldest, so she might have the best claim to the Whent holdings. She married Lord Eddard Stark and bore five children. Her surviving children are Sansa Stark, Bran Stark, and Arya Stark. Assuming that Sansa Stark does not claim the Whent family holdings because she is Queen of the North, and that Bran Stark does not claim the Whent family holdings because he is King of the Six Kingdoms, then the next claimant would be Arya Stark.</p>
<p>There are reasons why Arya might have no claim.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike the North which allows a woman to inherit a noble title (such as Lady Alys Karstark or Lady Lyanna Mormont), the nobles of the Riverlands might only pass title through a male line.</li>
<li>There might be other survivors of House Whent.</li>
<li>Edmure Tully or Robyn Arryn might try to press their claim to the Whent lands.</li>
<li>Arya's two older siblings might claim title ahead of her. (Sansa Stark is Queen of the North, but that is now a foreign land, but this is like how <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_the_Conqueror"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">William the Conqueror</a> claimed the titles of both King of England and Duke of Normandy at the same time. And if a person can claim multiple titles in Westeros, then Bran Stark could also claim to be King of the Six Kingdoms and Lord of Whent.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If the answers to these three questions are all &quot;no&quot;, then it seems Arya Stark is the next Lady Whent.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there anything in the books that says noble titles in the Riverlands can only be inherited by men?</li>
<li>Are there other survivors of the Whent family? (Including legitimized children born out of wedlock.)</li>
<li>Are there rules forbidding a person from claiming multiple noble titles?</li>
</ul>
<p>Although I mention events from the last episode of the TV series, which are not yet mentioned in the books, I am looking for answers to my questions from the books first, then other canon sources, and lastly the TV series.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","233063","<p>I am going to take your questions one by one...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there anything in the books that says noble titles in the Riverlands can only be inherited by men?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is nothing that says a woman <em>can't</em> inherit lands/titles. It is just very rare. Almost all houses are going to look to the <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/37862/comprehensive-rules-for-game-of-thrones-lines-of-succession"">male line first.</a> Walter Whent did have four sons, but they all perished with unknown status if they had any children. The same goes for his only daughter. Walter's brother Oswell was a member of the Kings Guard and also slain at the Tower of Joy. So. Walter's line is broken once Shelia is killed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are there other survivors of the Whent family? (Including legitimized children born out of wedlock.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only other known members of House Whent are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Minisa_Tully"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Minisa Whent</a>, deceased wife of Lord Hoster Tully, and mother to Catelyn, Lysa and Edmure Tully.</li>
<li><a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Sarya_Whent"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sarya Whent</a>, fifth wife of Lord Walder Frey. Deceased with no progeny.</li>
<li><a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Wynafrei_Whent"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wynafrei Whent</a>, married to the ninth son of Lord Walder Frey, Ser Danwell. She has no progeny yet, only many stillbirths and miscarriages so far.</li>
</ul>
<p>So without any other known members, all the direct line deceased or having no progeny, we would refer back to the first question and find the nearest male relative, Edmure Tully.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are there rules forbidding a person from claiming multiple noble titles?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not at all, in fact, <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/120262/what-titles-does-littlefinger-currently-hold"">Petyr Baelish holds many titles</a> in the books, which I do believe holds true through the show. With Littefinger's fate in the show, Lord Paramount of the Trident would pass back to Edmure Tully.</p>
<p>To summarize...</p>
<p>Being male, a direct Whent descendant, and being their liege lord, <strong>Edmure Tully would be the one to decide who would inherit House Whent's lands.</strong> Since the House is extinct he could effectively give to whomever he pleases (like how Bronn was set to inherit Highgarden in the show).</p>
<p>This would not likely be Arya, she is of the North, not the Riverlands. Edmure will have other vassals to appease or even keep the lands with the Tully's since their line was also devastated by the wars.</p>

<p><strong>Short answer:</strong> actively joining them is incredibly risky. Not just for the individual(s) making an epic journey to negotiate with an unknown, unpredictable queen - it also risks marking your <strong>entire family</strong> as traitors. </p>

<p>At no point in the show has it looked like there is a <strong>credible, active</strong> Targaryen counter rebellion with a strong chance of taking the throne worth overtly risking everything like that for - the closest are, a terrifyingly unpredictable dothraki horde, and an impressive army perplexingly marching the wrong way.</p>

<p>So, the loyalists quietly keep their heads down for now - the only exceptions are <strong>exiles and fugitives with nothing to lose</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Long answer:</strong> There were Targaryen loyalists. King Robert was worried that they might join a credible counter-rebellion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Robert was well aware that many of those who surrendered to him were reluctant and were potential traitors, and he took this risk seriously. Any pro-Targaryen action would be a huge risk - you'd mark yourself a traitor and a danger to the most powerful houses, and we see what happens to families who  mark themselves to be enemies of the powerful...</p>

<p>To take that sort of risk, you'd need some kind of <strong>inspiring leader</strong> who fills you with hope that they have a real chance of winning and that even if they fail, it's such a noble glorious cause that it's worth risking everything for.</p>

<p>For the decade and a half or so between the start of the show and the  rebellion, that ""inspiring leader"", traveling the free cities trying to rally support, was this guy:</p>

<p><a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Viserys"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/IXGJ1.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Feel inspired yet? No, nor did they. Viserys ends up desperate enough to resort to trying to piggyback on the back of the Dothraki as the khalessi's brother. </p>

<p>When he dies, the Targaryen loyalists have  another problem. The person they would now be risking everything to support might now be less uninspiring, but much more terrifying and unpredictable. He's probably not what they had in mind when they said they wanted a new king:</p>

<p><a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Drogo"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kSqou.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Robert might have been right that the loyalists might join a Dothraki/Targaryen army if it landed on their side of the sea. But before then? Far too risky  and unpredictable. The only man who does is Jorah, an <strong>exile with nothing to lose</strong> (and a spy hoping to earn a ticket home).</p>

<p>Then Drogo dies, the khalasar scatters, and it <strong>looks like it's all over</strong>. </p>

<p>By the time anyone in Westeros knows Dany has, against all the odds, become a credible power in her own right, she's the wrong side of the world, landed her ships, baffling any would-be supporters by going the wrong way. Does she even want to rule Westeros? They have no reason to be sure that she does. </p>

<p><a href=""http://quartermaester.info/"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QN9Fb.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>She's too far to easily get in contact with - you'd have to send a  valuable trusted envoy  on a dangerous journey, risking losing them or giving away your intentions. There's a storyline(s) in the books that appears to have been dropped from the show that makes explicit just how difficult, dangerous and risky this is for both the envoys (risking their lives on seas and roads where slavers are not the only danger), and the family who sent them (risking being discovered and knowing there's a risk this unknown, unpredictable queen might reject them).</p>

<p>Yet, people do spontaneously join her, uninvited. Who are they, and what do they have in common?</p>

<ul>
<li>Jorah was an <strong>exile with nothing to lose</strong></li>
<li>Barristan is effectively an <strong>exile with nothing to lose</strong>, having fallen out of favour with, then  overtly opposed, the most powerful family</li>
<li>Tyrion is a <strong>fugitive with nothing to lose</strong>, with a bounty on his head</li>
</ul>

<p>All those other loyalists and their families have too much to lose to stick their necks out. </p>

<p>But are they secretly plotting, or preparing themselves for a credible counter-rebellion? We'll have to wait and see...</p>

"163305","Did Petyr Baelish intend for Lysa to see him kiss Sansa Stark?","<p>In <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3060876/?ref_=ttep_ep7"" rel=""noreferrer"">Season 4, Episode 7</a> of <em>Game of Thrones</em>, Petyr Baelish kisses Sansa Stark after she creates her snow castle of Winterfell.
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HVz63.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HVz63.jpg"" alt=""kiss""></a></p>

<p>His wife, Lysa goes into a jealous rage and threatens Sansa's life.  Lord Baelish then proceeds to throw Lysa out of the moon door to her death.</p>

<p><strong>Did Lord Baelish kiss Sansa to ensure that Lysa would see the kiss and go into a rage?  Was this a plan by Lord Baelish to set up Lysa's death?</strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones>","163307","<p>On the surface it seems unlikely that Petyr could have coordinated the events that happened...</p>

<ol>
<li>It being snowing.</li>
<li>Sansa being in the courtyard building the castle.</li>
<li>Sweet Robin showing up, destroying the castle, causing Sansa grief.</li>
<li>Lysa being there at the right moment.</li>
<li>Lysa flying into a rage and trying push Sana through the Moon Door.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>However</em>, this is Petyr ""Chaos is a ladder"" Baelish, and I have no doubt that it was in his greater plan to remove Lysa from the picture as this would cement his position as Lord of the Eyrie, so let us examine the process...</p>

<ol>
<li>Petyr wakes up to find it snowing, not an unusual event for that time of year in the Eyrie.</li>
<li>Petyr sees Sansa building the snow castle and (unknown to us) notices Lysa keeping an eye on her. </li>
<li>Petyr sends Robin to play with Sansa, knowing that something will happen.</li>
<li>Knowing that Lysa is watching and of her jealousy of Catelyn and how much Sansa resembles her, he goes for the kiss. </li>
<li>Upon Lysa's descent into rage, Petyr capitalizes on the opportunity. </li>
</ol>

<p>It does all seems very unlikely, but remember this is the same man who was the catalyst for the downfall of at least three major houses (Arryn, Stark, Baratheon). Having known Lysa since childhood and considering the conspiracy they planned, it is likely Petyr had a good idea of how Lysa would react.</p>

<p><strong>So in the end, an opportunity presented itself, and true to his character Littlefinger seized it for his own ends!</strong></p>

<p>We have no explicit confirmation of this (other than knowing he eventually wanted Lysa dead) even when Littlefinger is opening up about what his long game is. Even the books, which if nothing else can provide clues to motives in the show, offer nothing as Petyr has no POV chapters.</p>

"94667","Where are the other Baelishes, if any?","<p>I had a random thought : Does Petyr Baelish still have any relatives? What happened to his parents? Any siblings? Any children, legitimate or illegitimate?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","94688","<blockquote>
<p>The device painted on the shield was one Sansa did not know; a grey stone head with fiery eyes, upon a light green field. &quot;My grandfather's shield,&quot; Petyr explained when he saw her gazing at it. &quot;His own father was born in Braavos and came to the Vale as a sellsword in the hire of Lord Corbray, so my grandfather took the head of the Titan as his sigil when he was knighted.&quot;<br />
<sub>(<em>A Storm of Swords: Blood and Gold</em>, p.357)</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Littlefinger's <strong>great-grandfather</strong> was Braavosi, but his <strong>grandfather</strong> was a Westerosi hedge knight.</p>
<p>And on the next page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Well, you can scarcely be my true-born daughter. I've never taken a wife, that's well known. What should you be called?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I ... I could call myself after my mother ...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Catelyn? A bit too obvious ... but after <em>my</em> mother, that would serve. Alayne. Do you like it?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So his <strong>mother</strong> was named Alayne, and he has <strong>no legitimate children</strong>.

<p>Quoting from an <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/US_Signing_Tour_Half_Moon_Bay_CA/"" rel=""noreferrer"">interview with GRRM</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In response to the why was LF fostered at Riverrun when he was a insignificant lord question: GRRM said that Petyr's father and Hoster met up during the War of the Ninepenny Kings and became friends. Apparently that was a time when a lot of people from all over the realm forged friendships. LF's dad later &quot;cashed in&quot; on the friendship to get LF fostered at Riverrun.</p>

<p>So his <strong>father</strong> was sufficiently high in society to be considered a friend by Lord Tully.</p>

"94751","Does Trial by Combat actually work?","<p>We've seen several instances of Trial by Combat in both the <em>Game of Thrones</em> TV series and the <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> novels. Trial by Combat is said to allow the gods themselves to determine the innocence of the accused party by having them win the fight if they are innocent and lose the fight if they are guilty.</p>

<p>But does it actually work?</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> In the Trial by Combat that takes place when Tyrion is accused of killing King Joffrey, his Champion (Oberyn Martell) is killed by the accuser's champion (Ser Gregor Clegane AKA The Mountain that Rides) even though we know that Tyrion didn't kill King Joffrey. That being said, Ser Gregor Clegane had already been poisoned by that point and his death was practically guaranteed - it could be argued that the gods stopped intervening at that point which led to the sudden reversal.</p>

<p>However,</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> In the Trial by Combat that sees Lord Beric Dondarrion battle Ser Sandor Clegane AKA The Hound, Lord Dondarrion puts his defeat down to the intervention of the Lord of Light, talking about a whip of fire that shattered his sword.</p>

<p>Is Trial by Combat only ever determined by the abilities of the combatants, rather than the gods as people believe?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","94761","<p>Trial by combat ""works"" in the sense that it quickly determines guilt, as opposed to a long trial that is often rigged (EG: both of Tyrion's trials). And for the reader/viewer it is more fun than slogging through long, drawn-out trials.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.atlredline.com/trial-by-combat-it-was-real-and-spectacular-1575163115"">This article</a> explains some of the historical context and why historically it was a poor choice to determine the innocence of an accused party:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The most popular, yet least used and least defensible trial by battle option was in the criminal context. That's how it's portrayed on Game of Thrones. A man stands accused of something, a show trial is convened, the man has the option to fight to the truth in the absence of a formal trial.</p>
  
  <p>You can see why this wasn't the preferred method of criminal justice, even in medieval England. Why would a king go through the trouble of setting up a show trial only to have it thwarted by the vagaries of hand to hand combat? We're talking about kings here, divine-right monarchs. Trial by combat doesn't put the decision in the hands of God, the king IS God. Nobody was getting out of a state criminal proceeding by hiring a good fighter.</p>
  
  <p>However, in their book History of Criminal Justice, Mark Jones and Peter Johnstone explain that trial by battle was used when the accuser and criminal defendant were both private parties. Again, this looks more like the land disputes we talked about earlier. ""He killed my friend."" ""No I didn't."" ""LIAR [draws sword].""</p>

<p>However, winters are meant to be significantly colder, not just for the North but presumably for the entire world.</p>

<p>How much are other, non-Northern places (such as Kings Landing, Dorne, and Essos, which have been depicted as warmer) affected by Winter? Do they face the same issues that the North faces (risks of freezing to death or starvation), or do they not have to worry about it as much as the Starks?</p>

<p>and to my knowledge</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">

<p>Much of this during the <strong>War of the Five Kings.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If Ned had refused his King's/Friends request and remained in Winterfell would the war still have occurred?</strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><character-motivation>","163620","<p><strong>Would the war still have occurred?</strong> </p>

<p>I think that it is highly likely that the end result would be similar, it might just happen with different players. </p>

<p>Remember who started this whole wheel in motion... Petyr ""Chaos is a Ladder"" Baelish! Considering how long he has been planning this plot it is likely that he is willing to change tactics and find the best result amid the chaos.</p>

<p>Also remember that Cersei is an active player in this game as well. She has been looking for a way to knock off good ol' Bobby B. The true start of the War is the suggested illegitimacy of Robert's children. Littlefinger would surely keep pushing this agenda to both Stannis and Renly once Robert is dead. Stannis also knew of the bastards as he was helping Jon Arryn investigate. While he fled to Dragonstone after Arryn's death, he was most likely trying to rally some support before pressing his claim. </p>

<p>No doubt Varys would want something similar to this out come as well. To get a Targaryen back on the throne the Seven Kingdoms need to be in a weakened state since the ""invading"" Targaryen army would have a much smaller, foreign army and no dragons this time around. The Lannisters are no easy foe as they control much of the kingdom's wealth. </p>

<p><strong>Overall it was not a matter of IF it was a matter of WHEN</strong>. All the masterminds (Petyr Baelish, Varys, and Cersei) seem to be willing to bide their time and adjust to external events accordingly. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Would Robb have been crowned King in the North?</strong></p>

<p>This is not as likely. If the Starks were brought into the new scenario (as I outlined above) Ned would have raised his banners for Stannis. </p>

<p>Ned refused Renly's offer while still in King's Landing because Stannis ""has the right"". But this is why Robb was proclaimed as King in the North in the first place, as basically since there was no clear heir to throne, why should they have one at all.  The North was seeking justice/vengeance for the Lannisters beheading their liege lord. With Ned still alive, they are fighting to restore proper law with Stannis. Ned would not have allowed his bannermen to declare him King. </p>

<p>If Ned was killed in battle there would be no cause for vengeance from the North. Robb would carry on the good fight in the name of Stannis and either that side is victorious or is defeated.</p>

<p>At the Purple Wedding,</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Littlefinger and Lady Olenna Tyrell</p>
</blockquote>

<p>perform their plan of</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> poisoning King Joffrey.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A short summary of their plan:</p>

<p>Littlefinger orders Ser Dontos Hollard to give Sansa Stark a beautiful silver hairnet adorned with amethysts.<br>
At least some of the amethysts are actually strangler crystals in disguise.<br>
Ser Dontos also, still under orders of Littlefinger, urges Sansa to wear the hairnet at the wedding, which she then does.<br>
At the wedding, when Lady Olenna greets Sansa, she fusses her hairnet a bit, while secretly taking one of the strangler crystals.<br>
Later, during the wedding, Lady Olenna puts the crystal in Joffrey's royal cup, poisoning him.</p>

<p>But why was their plan so complicated?
Why couldn't Lady Olenna just bring a strangler crystal with her to the wedding (as suggested in <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/93365/15363"">this answer</a>)?</p>

<p>Then they wouldn't depend on Ser Dontos and Sansa who could unknowingly have done something to prevent the success of the plan.</p>

<p>The only reason that I could think of, is Littlefinger and Lady Olenna plan for Sansa (and Tyrion as her husband with her) to take the blame for Joffrey's death.</p>

<p>They put the crystals on her person, so that upon examination it would clearly show that Sansa had the murder weapon on her. But Littlefinger had a plan he did not tell Lady Olenna, namely rescuing Sansa during the chaos ensuing the murder (and thereby leaving Tyrion behind as the only accused).</p>

<p>Is there anything confirming or debunking this theory?
If my theory doesn't hold up, is there another explanation for why the plan was so needlessly complicated?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","94968","<p>It is complicated because there a lot of moving parts to the plan and competing agendas. </p>

<p>I think you mostly have it right, except the part about Olenna agreeing that Sansa takes the blame. It may be more subtle than that.</p>

<p>See below:</p>

<hr>

<p>Ostensibly, Littlefinger's main goal is to Assassinate Joffrey, per his agreement with Olenna.</p>

<p>But Littlefinger also knows this will give him his one opportunity to free Sansa, which most likely is his main goal. He won't get another opportunity as the Lannisters would never agree to give her up, and she is a perfect scapegoat with no allies at court and with the Starks as enemies of the crown. Meaning he cannot assume he will be able to stage an escape attempt after the assassination.</p>

<p>There will only be a short time window for her to escape, while everyone is distracted by the assassination. </p>

<p>Littlefinger needs someone Sansa trusts (Ser Dontos) to ensure his plan is successful. He can watch for the precise moment to escape with her, he has detailed knowledge of where to take her, and she will agree to go.</p>

<hr>

<p>On the other hand, Lady Olenna is no fool and most likely only agreed to betroth Margery to Joffrey after Littlefinger guaranteed Joffrey could be replaced with a more suitable husband. She may have wanted to directly take part in the assassination to guarantee its success.</p>

<p>But, she would not want to carry the poison on herself because:</p>

<ul>
<li>It might be found if guests were stopped and searched</li>
<li>The hall is crowded and someone might notice if she drops/discards it</li>
<li>Littlefinger could double-cross her (EG: a guest could accuse her, and then the Lannisters find the poison on her)</li>
</ul>

<p>This plays into Littlefinger's plans as Sansa is the perfect candidate to carry the poison (for both Littlefinger and Olenna), and will most likely be happy to have done so when she finds out about it later</p>

<p>Olenna probably did not originally want Sansa to take the blame, as she wanted her to marry a Tyrell so the Tyrells could claim the north.</p>

<p>But Olenna may have felt it an acceptable risk for Sansa to carry the poison if someone else (Tyrion) was planned to take the blame. If Sansa is found out, Olenna still achieves her primary goal of assassinating Joffrey. She just loses an opportunity to also get Sansa. And of course she would not have cared about Sansa at all once Tyrion married her.</p>

<p>I thought the show emphasized more of a sexual attraction between them than was present in the books. There was some in the books, but I thought that was more due to Jaime coming to care about Brienne (because he now respects her) and being that she is perhaps the second woman in his life that he's ever really cared about, even he isn't sure about his own feelings.</p>

<p>Consider, he loves his sister and knows their love is forbidden. He cares about Brienne, and in his eyes (because of her imperfections) their care and respect for one another would be forbidden. With his sister, he just goes and consummates. He doesn't with Brienne, but he may well feel that he should, because <em>that's what he thinks he is supposed to do with women he cares about and respects</em>.

<p>From a strength perspective, it doesn't matter whether the doors open inward or outward.  What matters is whether an attacker's actions cause tension or compression.  If you have the typical doors you see in castles, a battering ram hit causes tension - the wooden beams pull against each other to resist the ram.  If you bow the doors out a bit, you can see that they cause compression instead.  Trying to ram the doors causes the doors to try to close more, compressing all of the timbers.</p>

<p>Different materials handle tension and compression in different ways.  Concrete, for instance, is very good at compression loads but falls apart under tension loads.  Accordingly, you'll always see concrete structures in compression.  Look at a bridge, and you'll always see an arch to it, ensuring the whole bridge is in compression.</p>

<p>Wood, on the other hand, is much better at tension loads.   Compression loading focuses all of the forces on one part of the door, while tension loading lets wood do what it is best at.  If you rammed a door in compression, the wood would rapidly splinter, rather than bending to soak up the energy and momentum.  (There's more to it, dealing with cross grain and along-the-grain forces, but that's another physics lesson)</p>

<p>So you definitely want a door structured so that battering rams cause tension.  If you run the geometry, you see that it's really hard to have a door open outwards <em>and</em> exhibit tension under attack.</p>

"164034","Why are castle gates in GoT generally double doors?","<p>The gates of Dragonstone have two doors (GoT Season 7 Episode 1). </p>

<p>Why? Wouldn't a gate be stronger if it had a single door, even if it were to open inwards (harder to ram open using the principle of moments, since aiming a battering ram at the edge would now be much harder). </p>

<p>The only reasons I could think of is that for the same width, a single wide door would: (a) have a weaker core (more of it is just wood, not reinforced), (b) 
have more distance between the outer edge and the hinge, requiring less force to open and (c) during peacetime you could do some flow control and traffic management with a double door, by closing only one.</p>

<p>On the other hand, having a wide open maw in the middle (see picture below) probably makes this very easy to ram down the middle.</p>

<p>Authors frequently delve into all kinds of engineering depth while worldbuilding; has any discussion about this come up in the books, fan interviews... to be clear, I'm not asking why this was the case historically, just in this particular realm.</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","164044","<p>As with your other question this is nothing to do with Game of Thrones and everything to do with real life.</p>

<p>A single door of the same width and weight as two double doors exerts approximately four times the moment on it's single hinge as each of the two double doors. Or to put it another way, you can build your double doors four times as strong for the same hinge technology. Also hinges are stronger than the unattached edge of a door.</p>

"27187","What is the reason/significance of a lion as Lannister house sigil?","<p>I'm halfway through the first half of <em>A Storm of Swords</em>, and so far appearances or references to every animal/symbol of every house sigil have been made, with exception to the lion of Lannister.</p>

<p>I mean, we've seen <strong>direwolves</strong> (Stark), <strong>stags</strong> (Baratheon), <strong>bears</strong> (Mormont), <strong>dragons</strong> (Targaryen), <strong>trouts</strong> (Tully) and eagles (although Arryn's sigil is a <strong>falcon</strong>, it is close enough and most likely exists). We know that there are sigils such as the Frey's <strong>Twins</strong>  or the Martell's <strong>Sun and Spear</strong> (Sunspear) that are a reference to their ""keep's"" name or location. Furthermore, in page 108 of ASOS's first part, Jorah Mormont tells Daenerys that ""(...)dragons(...) grew so huge that they could pluck giant <strong>krakens</strong> from the seas."", making reference to the Greyjoy's sigil animal, in a way that is not metaphorical. The Tyrell's sigil is a <strong>flower</strong>, which is explained by their natural lands, fertile and flowery. Similar to the case of House Arryn's sigil is House Florent's (we've seen wolves but not <strong>foxes</strong>, but they most likely exist in Westeros South, since the geographical location and climate would allow them to).</p>

<p>This means that, excluding the <strong>lion</strong> of Lannister, every house sigil (that I am aware of so far) as been referenced in conditions other than metaphors (like the lion defeating the wolf, referring to this or that battle between Lannister and Stark, etc.), and/or can have its meaning traced back to its House's geographical location.</p>

<p>As far as I have read, no lion other than a metaphorical one (used in confrontations with other houses, reflecting the characteristics (fierce, beautiful, etc.) of some Lannister House member, etc.) or the one present in the Lannister House sigil has been spotted or referenced in the books. Judging from the biomes in Westeros, I'd say that lions are bound to be indigenous to some location further South (or perhaps they come from Essos). This begs the question: <strong>Do lions exists in Westeros or in the world of ASOIAF? If so, why is it House Lannister's sigil? Shouldn't they have picked some animal natural to their geographical region or something like that?</strong></p>

<p>If this question is simply something that is answered by reading the rest of the series just tell me so, and sorry for the long question.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","27207","<p>In A Clash of Kings, Sandor Clegane tells Sansa the story of how his house came to be, and the story behind his sigil.</p>

<p>His father was a kennel master in service to a Lannister lord, as I recall Tyrion's grandfather, Lord Tywin's father. One day when they were out hunting, the lord came under attack from a lion, but the kennel master set his dogs on the lion and saved the lord. Three of the dogs died, and the grateful lord bestowed lands and title on his kennel master. Those three dogs were then put on the Clegane arms, in memory of their heroism.</p>

<p>So at least in that story, it would seem there are lions in the area of Casterly Rock.</p>

<p>EDIT: Found the reference:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first knight of House Clegane was kennelmaster at Casterly Rock until he saved Lord Tytos Lannister from a lioness and lost a leg and three dogs in the effort. As a reward, Lord Tytos gave him lands and a towerhouse and took his son as his squire. The three dogs on the Clegane sigil represent those that died saving Lord Tytos.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quoted from the wiki at westeros.org: <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Clegane"">House Clegane</a></p>

<p>EDIT 2: Exact quote from A Clash of Kings, page 262:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I like dogs better than knights. My father's father was kennelmaster at the Rock. One autumn year, Lord Tytos came between a lioness and her prey. Lioness didn't give a shit that she was Lannister's own sigil. Bitch tore into my lord's horse and would have done for my lord too, but my grandfather came up with the hounds. Three of his dogs died running her off. My grandfather lost a leg, so Lannister paid him for it with lands and a towerhouse, and took his son to squire. The three dogs on our banner are the three that died, in the yellow of autumn grass. A hound will die for you, but never lie to you. And he'll look you straight in the face.""</p>

<p>But reaching The Wall early will not do them any good. The wights can be destroyed by regular weapons. The White Walkers can be destroyed by dragonglass and Valaryian Steel, and the Night's King knows the humans have both these weapons.

"164253","Why didn't the Lannisters occupy Dragonstone?","<p>As Daenerys lands at Dragonstone, it is a deserted place. Cersei could have captured the place or even destroyed it with wildfire. She already knew Dany was coming and she would station most probably at Dragonstone.</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","164256","<h3>Rant</h3>
<p>Actually no.</p>
<p>The analysis shown by TV show is wrong.</p>
<p>Jaime says Daenerys will land most probably on Dragonstone because of Deep water ports. That doesn't make any military sense, I'll explain why:</p>
<ol>
<li>The closest Westerosi port from Meereen is Planky town.</li>
<li>It is a major port of Westeros and trading hub so naturally has Deep-Water ports.</li>
<li>Dragonstone is very far up North, right in front of the King's Landing.</li>
<li>The Dornish are Targaryen allies.</li>
<li>The Tyrells, other Targaryen allies, border the Dornish.</li>
<li>Two highways go from Dorne to KL. One from Prince's pass and one from the Boneway.</li>
</ol>
<p>So Planky Town should have been the most obvious choice for landing zone.</p>
<p>Timing is everything in the war, Daenerys should have chosen the closest friendly port for landing which is Planky Town. She could easily land there, get her armies together, plan her moves, in a friendly port rather than sailing to parts unknown where she might fact resistance.</p>
<p>Dragonstone is a desolate rock with no strategic advantage other than presenting a base for a naval blockade of King's Landing. And it is very much up north, Why take the risk of maritime travel in notoriously stormy Narrow sea in Winter? Targaryen troops are most vulnerable when embarked.</p>
<p>Daenerys needed to connect with her allies. Those are Dornish and Tyrells. The Starry Sept, most prestigious sept in the country since destruction of Sept of Baelor is located in Old Town on Tyrell-Martell border. Aegon the Conqueror himself was crowned there. Daenerys could have done the same. A formal coronation and anointation to match unanointed Cersei would have been huge.</p>
<p>But because D&amp;D wanted an emotional scene, they took Dany back to her birthplace and ancient seat of Targaryens. Reeeeeeeeeeee!</p>
<h3>Answer</h3>
<p>Now that my rant is over, coming back to your original question and playing along with D&amp;D's rules, it would be because any resistance there would have been futile.</p>
<p>Crown did not have a Navy since the Battle of Blackwater bay. Who was going to ferry the occupation troops? There are no funds to raise new fleet anyways, The crown is bankrupt, the Lannister coffers are empty and the Ironbank is pissed because of Crown defaulting on Robert's debts.</p>
<p>And even if they somehow ferried troops across the gullet, to what end?</p>
<p>There would have been no prospect of relief once Daenerys had landed at Dragonstone and the men sent there would have been lost, men who would be needed to defend King's Landing in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>So it was much better to conserve your strength, let Daenerys take Dragonstone as there wasn't much they could do about it anyways, and then defend King's Landing, which itself is madness.</p>
<p>An even better approach would have been abandoning King's Landing and retreating to Casterly Rock. Visenya Targaryen took a look at the rock and thanked God that Lannisters had chosen to fight in the field instead of falling back to their great castle. But abandoning KL means abandoning the throne as well. There isn't much hope for Lannister cause anyways, what remains is, how much can they salvage from the situation?</p>
<p>As for destroying Dragonstone, cui bono? Who benefits? And not to mention, it is unlikely Cersei has that much Wildfire left, if any, or means to transport it to Dragonstone.</p>

No man would ever yield to a creature such as Reek, no matter how desperate his situation. He must pretend to be a prince again.</p>
<p>His captor stared at his face, squinting, his mouth twisted in suspicion. His teeth were brown, and his breath stank of ale and onion. “Lord Balon’s sons were killed.”</p>

<p>Those words struck home. He could see it in their eyes, in the way they looked at one another or frowned above their cups.

"165553","Why would Lady Olenna recommend ignoring ""clever men"" like this?","<p>Mild spoilers for the newest <em>Game of Thrones</em> episode (season 7 episode 2) ahead. </p>

<p>After the war council meeting on Dragonstone, Olenna Tyrell speaks to the would-be-queen afterward and has this to say (in paraphrase, because I don't have the script):</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>""Your Hand is a clever man. I've known a great deal of clever men... and outlived them all.  Do you want to know how?  I ignored them.  You are a dragon-- <em>be a dragon.</em>""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So her advice, in a nutshell, is ""ignore the clever plans and do whatever you want, because <em>girl power</em>, am I right?"" This seems like a singularly terrible idea for many reasons.</p>

<p>We all know Lady Olenna is a smart cookie.  Is there any reason to think Danaerys's best tactic would be to snub the advice of her Hand?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","165568","<p>On face value, leaving aside Olenna's agendas, the basic idea is: don't try to be too clever, because clever plans never go as planned. You've got power, use it.</p>

<p>There's an important detail missing from your quote: before she said about being a dragon, she said something like, ""Most lords are sheep"". Then she said Dany is a  dragon <em>in contrast</em> with the sheep. It's the old idea that is a theme throughout the show that power resides where people believe it resides - her spin on it is, if you want to herd the sheep, you don't come up with some terribly clever experimental sheep influencing system, you just assert yourself over the sheep. </p>

<p>If you want lords to fall in line, and you have dragons plus a fearsome army, don't attempt some clever but delicate plan which will fall apart if some unforeseen problem emerges (like, to give a purely hypothetical example, if one of your fleets is intercepted and set on fire by a strong naval ally you didn't realise your enemies had). </p>

<p>Just get on with asserting yourself the old fashioned way by terrifying them with your three dragons.</p>

<hr>

<p>Of course she also has an interest in reducing Dany's trust in her rival advisors. She saw Tyrion as a fool ever since he begged her to pay for the royal wedding, she never trusted Varys, and dislikes the Dornish who are traditionally Tyrell enemies. I think we don't know her views on the Iron Islanders (beyond liking the phrase ""We do not sow"") but given her general attitude they're probably unrepeatable. </p>

<p>She doesn't want these other oafs with their foolish plans getting in the way of her revenge. At this point, with her entire family dead, she just wants to watch the world burn. </p>

<hr>

<p>To give a little more context to her contempt for the clever men she outlived, think of a few:</p>

<ul>
<li>Her ""oafish"" son, who thought he was clever with his timely allegiance with the Lannisters, which worked for a time then backfired because (as Olenna had feared) he couldn't control it through all the unforeseen twists and turns</li>
<li>Loras and Renly, who had a clever plan for seizing the throne, which failed because of unforeseen events they couldn't respond to</li>
<li>Tywin, who cleverly dominated Westeros for decades, but in doing so stacked up enemies, even in his own family, who eventually killed him in unforeseen circumstances</li>
<li>Her late husband, who she talks about as a symbol of all the many foolish oafs she is always despairing of, who was so busy observing the movements of birds while hunting he didn't see the cliff edge he galloped over</li>
</ul>

<p>Olenna's schemes, in contrast, tend to be pretty blunt and therefore less fragile in the face of the unexpected. Just buy influence with grain, wealth and marriages instead of fighting or scheming for it. Just get on and poison the guy who's a problem, letting someone else sort the details and someone else take the blame. Just burn the bloody queen who killed your family.</p>

<p>He also wasn't there for </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> the Battle of the Bastards</p>

<p>either. <strong>So where is he?</strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones>","165571","<p><strong>In Universe</strong>, we do not know where Ghost is currently.  The actor who plays Davos theorised that the <a href=""https://winteriscoming.net/2016/06/21/liam-cunningham-davos-explains-why-ghost-wasnt-in-battle-of-the-bastards/"" rel=""noreferrer"">battle is not a safe place for Ghost</a>, and so that's why he isn't included in the Battle of the Bastards.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah that would have been cool, [but] obviously a big battle like that is no place for a direwolf,” he said. “They’re not gonna last very long – I mean look at what happened to Wun Wun, the last of the giants.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>I would assume that Ghost is with Jon (just off screen) but it's definitely possible that he is off hunting, or still at Castle Black.</strong></p>
<p>Obviously, this does not jive with book passages or previous scenes showing various direwolves in battle.</p>
<p><strong>Out of Universe</strong>, <a href=""http://time.com/4377207/game-of-thrones-ghost-battle-of-the-bastards/"" rel=""noreferrer"">the director explained that Ghost was cut from that battle for budgetary reasons</a>, the same reason that all of the direwolves' roles have diminished as the series has gone along.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;[Ghost] was in there in spades originally, but it's also an incredibly time consuming and expensive character to bring to life,&quot; Sapochnik told Business Insider. &quot;Ultimately we had to choose between Wun-Wun and the direwolf, so the dog bit the dust.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly enough, it seems that <a href=""https://www.vox.com/2017/7/23/16017680/game-of-thrones-arya-direwolf-nymeria-stormborn"" rel=""noreferrer"">Direwolves may be more expensive to create then the Dragons</a> (which also haven't made much of an appearance yet this season).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though the series showed a lot of the wolves in season one, their appearances have been noticeably rare in later seasons, with two being brought back in season six only to be unceremoniously killed off.</p>
<p>That’s no accident. Game of Thrones has found that <strong>now that the direwolves are big enough that they have to be CGI creations, they’re very expensive and difficult to animate.</strong> (They seem to have been much more challenging than the dragons, perhaps because it’s more difficult to convincingly animate an animal that we expect to look and move like a real wolf.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Out of Universe, this would continue to hold true for future episodes.  It's simply too expensive for them to film Ghost walking next to Jon as he goes about his daily routine.</p>

"96202","Khal Drogo's awareness of his injuries","<p>I have just started watching GoT. I came across the end of Season 1 where Khal Drogo defends Khaleesi and get himself slashed by the sickle across his chest.</p>

<p>Now as per common knowledge, Khal Drogo had become the leader by not losing in any fights. But a warrior/soldier who has been in multiple fights will always have wounds or scars from old wounds. However, in case of Khal Drogo, we practically see no sign of any injuries on his body. To add to this, it is seen that many decisions/disputes within the tribe are settled by combat. Judging by Khal's position, he must have even faced many internal fights. Thus, the lack of any scars is a bit unsettling for me. Also, Dothrakis don't use metal armor thus increasing the chances of injuries even in victories.</p>

<p>Keeping apart the the observations that a great warrior such as Khal has never been injured (which is still disturbing in my mind), can it be said that Khal lacked the awareness of injuries? Had he been aware about the problems an open wound can create, he himself would have called medics to get it cleaned and cured.</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","96205","<p>From ""A Game of Thrones - Daenerys VII"":</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She knelt before the khal. ""My sun-and-stars is wounded."" The arakh
  cut was wide but shallow; <strong>his left nipple was gone, and a flap of
  bloody flesh and skin dangled from his chest like a wet rag.</strong></p>
  
  <p>""<strong>Is scratch</strong>, moon of life, from arakh of one bloodrider to Khal Ogo,""
  Khal Drogo said in the Common Tongue. ""I kill him for it, and Ogo
  too."" He turned his head, the bells in his braid ringing softly. ""Is
  Ogo you hear, and Fogo his khalakka, who was khal when I slew him.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And also:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Many riders are hurt,"" Khal Drogo said stubbornly. ""Let them be
  healed first. <strong>This arrow is no more than the bite of a fly, this
  little cut only a new scar to boast of to my son.</strong>""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Khal Drogo waved him away. ""I need no man's help,"" he said, in a voice
  proud and hard. He stood, unaided, towering over them all.</strong> A fresh
  wave of blood ran down his breast, from where Ogo's arakh had cut off
  his nipple. Dany moved quickly to his side. ""I am no man,"" she
  whispered, ""so you may lean on me.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He cannot show weakness, because at that point his position as Khal is in danger. He can be challenged, and perhaps even defeated. It takes quite a while before he agrees to be treated and by that time it is basically too late.</p>

"165640","How did Euron get so close unnoticed?","<p>Attention, heavy spoiler ahead (Season 7, episode 2).</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> At the end of the Season 7, Episode 2, Euron attacked and destroyed the Targaryen fleet. My question is how did he manage to get so close to the admiral ship, where two queens had their quarters, without a little bit of notice?
 From my understanding the admiral's ship was in the middle of their fleet. To ram them, Euron had to go through the whole Targaryen fleet and not trigger any alarms. How is that possible?</p>
</blockquote>
","<game-of-thrones>","165642","<ul>
<li>Euron's ships appear from the mist. It is obvious from Yara's reaction that their presence was unnoticed.</li>
<li>The initial attack occurs by catapult fire. The counter tactic to catapult fire is to spread yourselves out. If you stick together, the catapult only needs to aim at the center of your group and it is liable to hit someone. It is not a precision instrument, it's unlikely to hit its intended target. Therefore, if the ships spread out (which is the best tactic), this gives Euron the opening to sail in between the spread out fleet.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>edit</strong> An even better point: Being bombarded by catapult fire would give Yara's ships a reason to want to sail <em>into the mist</em>. This may have been an intentional tactic by Euron.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are also a few things to take into consideration. Though they are from the books, and the show could have diverged from the books in this regard, it has not yet been confirmed that the show has actively contradicted the books:</p>

<ul>
<li>Euron plays with the supernatural, he is a very lovecraftian character. It is possible that he controlled the mist, therefore managing to sneak up on the fleet, who did not consider the mist to be anything more than a natural phenomenon.</li>
<li>Euron's flagship is called the Silence, as its crew are all mutes. Although I'm not sure how deep this goes in the books, it's possible that the Silence intentionally operates more quietly so as to not give away their position, thus making it capable of sneaking up on the enemy.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>If Euron's sneak attack is very unusual, I expect the next episode to elaborate on this. Otherwise, it seems fair to assume that this is a normal (though very clever) tactic.</p>

"28052","Why do they still refer to the ""Seven Kingdoms"" in Game of Thrones?","<p>As I understand it, the ""Seven Kingdoms"" refer to the kingdoms before Aegon's Conquest. Aren't there more kingdoms around the time that the first book is set? (For example, the Iron Islands and Riverlands are now two kingdoms, right?)</p>

<p>So why does everyone refer to there being seven?</p>

<p>For example, Robert says to Ned:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""In the South, the way they talk about my Seven Kingdoms, a man forgets that your part is as big as the other six combined.""</p>

But the story of the Targaryens conquering the Seven Kingdoms of old is now an intrinsic part of the lore of the land, and the stuff of legend. So when people refer to the Seven Kingdoms, they really mean the lands that were <em>once</em> ruled as seven separate kingdoms before the rise of Aegon I. You can say it's a romantic way to refer to Westeros.</p>

"96435","What's the Valyrian word for “password”?","<p>I suppose there is a Valyrian word for “password”. Is it known/documented somewhere?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><languages>","125188","<p>Forgetting, for the moment, looking for a translation for 'password' and instead looking at how the sentence 'all passwords must die' works:</p>
<p>The phrase 'udrir morghulis' ('udir' means 'word' and so 'udrir' means 'all words') doesn't technically translate to saying 'all words must die' but actually states the 'fact' that 'all words die' - 'valar morghulis' is actually the fact that 'all men die' (interesting and irrelevant aside: this <em>explicitly</em> excludes women - the phrase 'all people die' is actually 'abrar morghulis', which is also 'all women die'). Being extremely pedantic, it's really stating the fact that 'all men are currently going towards death'</p>
<p>So, there are a few ways to go about this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a valyrian word for password and put this in the statement that 'all passwords are going towards death'</li>
<li>Create a valyrian word for password and put this in the command that 'all passwords must die' (easy once 1. has been done)</li>
<li>Create a statement that says something along the lines of 'all words that allow passage die'</li>
<li>Create a command that says something along the lines of 'all words that allow passage must die'</li>
</ol>
<p>To create a recognisable meme or somesuch, 1. would be the best option.</p>
<p>First of all, creating something to mean password:
the verb 'to pass' is 'rēbagon' and the noun 'word' is 'udir', so the simplest hack is just to use 'rēb' (the stem) and add 'udir' to the end.
So <strong>The Valyrian word for 'password' is (probably) 'rēbudir'</strong> Proncounced [reː'budir] and is a 5th declension, aquatic noun.</p>
<h1>Thus, 'All passwords are going towards death' translates to <em>'rēbudrir morghūlis'</em></h1>
<p>As 'morghūljagon' is a consonant-final verb, <strong>commanding all passwords to die is given by 'rēbudrirzi morghūljās'</strong></p>
<p>Now, forgetting about the word for 'password', translating the phrase 'all words that allow passage':</p>
<ul>
<li><p>As before, 'all words' = 'udrir'</p>
</li>
<li><p>'to allow' = 'gaomagon' (consonant-final, stem = 'gaom')</p>
</li>
<li><p>'to pass' = 'rēbagon' (consonant-final, stem = 'rēb')</p>
<p>Turning this into a relative clause (see comments) gives 'rēbagon gaomis luor udrir' as 'all words which allow to pass'.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, the phrase <strong>'all words that allow to pass are going to death' is 'rēbagon gaomis luor udrir morghūlis'</strong> and giving permission for <strong>'all words that allow to pass may die' is 'rēbagon gaomis luor udrir morghūlis kostas'</strong></p>
<p>Finally, turning this into a command gives <strong>'all words that allow to pass must die [go to death]' as 'rēbagon gaomis luos udrirzi morghūljās'</strong></p>
<p>All of the information used above has been taken from <a href=""http://wiki.dothraki.org/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the Tongues of Ice and Fire Wiki</a></p>
<p>For completeness (unnecessary as it was pre-edit, but potentially interesting):</p>
<p>The word 'passage' (or anything that's equivalent) is the noun of the verb 'to pass', which is 'rēbagon' as before. To turn this into a noun, just add 'non' to the stem:</p>
<ul>
<li>'passage' = 'rēbnon' (3rd declension, terrestrial)</li>
</ul>
<p>Putting 'word' as the subject and 'passage' as the object creates the phrase 'udrir rēbnon gaomisi' as 'words allowing passage'. 'current words allowing passage' would be 'udrir rēbnon gaomis'</p>

"166108","How long would it take to do a recon dragon flight north of the wall?","<p>It feels like Daenerys can easily fly her dragons (or train riders) north of the wall on a reconnaissance mission (or to spy on rival armies). </p>

<p>Consider a trip from (for example) Dragonstone to the Wall. By all estimates, this would be <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KAqa9wwODqaFkegqf8Si6fmuE55-M-GMIj0ZmcKUFxs"" rel=""noreferrer"">less than 2000 miles</a>, and the dragons have already proved that they can <a href=""https://movies.stackexchange.com/questions/56197/did-the-dragons-fly-along-with-daenerys-fleet"">make very long flights</a>.</p>

<p>How long would such a trip really take (as the dragon flies)? Has there been any explanation as to why the dragons are not used in this way?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","166284","<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This is a books answer as there is no indication in the show regarding the question.</p>
<h3>GRRM's Position</h3>
<p>First of all, it is by design that GRRM remains ambiguous about distances, time and speed. He just doesn't want people to go around with a stopwatch and a measuring tape and find errors in his story.</p>
<p>When a fan asked how big is Westeros, his <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/2787"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">answer was</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I have deliberately tried to be vague about such things, so I don't have obsessive fans with rulers measuring distances on the map</strong> and
telling me Ned couldn't get from X to Y in the time I say he did.</p>
<p>However, if you really must know, <strong>you can figure out the distances
for yourself. The Wall is a hundred leagues long. A league is three
miles. Go from there</strong>.</p>
<p>But if you turn up any mistakes in travel times by using that measure,
let it be your secret.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When another fan asked about Chronology of Sam's adventures, he <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Chronology_and_Distances"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">replied</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason I am never specific about dates and distances is precisely
so that people won't sit down and do this sort of thing.</p>
<p>My suggestion would be to put away the ruler and the stopwatch, and
just enjoy the story.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it is by design that you don't see much information about distances or time it takes to cover a certain distance for varying means of transport.</p>
<h3>But are there any indications in the Books?</h3>
<p>Yes there are. Prince Daemon and Princess Rhaenyra used to race to Dragonstone on their dragons and back to Kingslanding almost every day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Princess Rhaenyra was a different matter. Daemon spent long hours in
her company, enthralling her with tales of her journeys and battles.
He gave her pearls and silks and books and a jade tiara said once to
have belonged to the Empress of Leng, read poems to her, dined with
her, hawked with her, sailed with her, entertained her by making mock
of the greens at court, the “lickspittles” fawning over Queen Alicent
and her children. He praised her beauty, declaring her to be the
fairest maid in all the Seven Kingdoms. <strong>Uncle and niece began to fly
together almost daily, racing Syrax against Caraxes to Dragonstone and
back.</strong><br><sub><sup> <em><strong>- The Rogue Prince</strong></em></sup></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While there are also numerous other accounts of Dragons flying from Dragonstone to Winterfell, Dragonstone to Kingslanding, Dragonstone to Storm's End, King's Landing to Harrenhal etc this is the only account which has a time factor mentioned with the words &quot;almost daily&quot;. So that means, a small trip to Dragonstone and back could be done easily within a day. If we minus 7-9 Hours of sleep needed by both riders, minus further 2-3 Hours for getting ready, getting breakfast, feeding your dragons, minus further 2-3 hours for Lunch and Dinner, that leaves us with 10-13 workable hours. If they could easily take two trips to Dragonstone, that means in worst case scenario, it must have taken them 5-6 Hours for one-way trip. In best case, We can probably assume that it would have taken them less than 1 hour for one-way trip. There are also rumors that the Uncle and Niece took those trips to carry on with, uh certain family affairs, away from the prying eyes of the Court. So it must have taken them a few hours to carry on, uh those activities which makes the case for &lt;1 Hours even stronger.</p>
<p>Now that is only less than a couple hundred Miles from King's Landing to Dragonstone.</p>
<p>Now let's a take a larger example. The travel from Winterfell to the Wall. It is a long journey, as per your own inaccurate map it is supposed to be around 600-700 miles away. Queen Alysanne grew bored one day while her husband was busy talking to his Warden of the North in Winterfell, so she took wing and went to the wall. Given the casual nature of the trip, I assume the Queen did not expect it to take longer than few hours  (Else she would have at least notified someone or taken someone along with her. King was unlikely to let her go alone for long time.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A queen stayed there for a night.&quot; Old Nan had told him the story,
but Maester Luwin had confirmed most of it. &quot;Alysanne, the wife of
King Jaehaerys the Conciliator. He's called the Old King because he
reigned so long, but he was young when he first came to the Iron
Throne. In those days, it was his wont to travel all over the realm.
When he came to Winterfell, he brought his queen, six dragons, and
half his court. <strong>The king had matters to discuss with his Warden of
the North, and Alysanne grew bored, so she mounted her dragon
Silverwing and flew north to see the Wall.</strong> This village was one of
the places where she stopped. Afterward the smallfolk painted the top
of their holdfast to look like the golden crown she'd worn when she
spent the night among them.&quot;** <br><sub><sup> <em><strong>ASOS - Jon
V</strong></em></sup></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is possible that she did notify the King and the trip may have taken longer as she stopped midway on multiple points, after all it's Jon's POV who summarizes the whole event, but we do not know it for sure.</p>
<p>Anyways, judging by Alysanne's trip to Wall, Rhaenyra's race to Dragonstone and Prince Jacaerys' trip to Vale~White Harbor~Winterfell, I'd put the estimate to &lt;10 hours.</p>
<p>It can't be emphasized enough, that this is merely my interpretation and speculation. George doesn't want you to worry about these things.</p>
<h3>Why aren't dragons used to spy on approaching armies?</h3>
<p>As I said before in comments, that is because of the nature of the beast. Dragons are the ultimate weapon of destruction. They can easily destroy any army they come across so why bother with using them for recon flights? Prince Aemond showed this one-dragon army style warfare in Dance of the Dragons.</p>
<p>Dragons have however been used against Armies north of the Wall.</p>
<p>King Jaehaerys I, grandson of Aegon the Conqueror, successfully unleashed his dragons against the Army of King Beyond the Wall.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His Grace gave the babe a pearl ring off his finger to play with, and
told the twins the story of how their great-great-grandsire and
namesake <strong>Jaehaerys the Old King had flown his dragon north to the Wall</strong>
<strong>to defeat a vast host of wildlings, giants, and wargs</strong>. The children
listened attentively. Afterward the king sent them away, pleading
weariness.<br><sub><sup> <em><strong>- The Rogue Prince</strong></em></sup></sub></p>

<p>It seems that he should be days behind. A few explanations could be:
1. The show is misleading for the sake of time.
2. His ships are much faster (perhaps due to design/favourable winds/enhancement).
3. He has a magical method of travelling faster than normal.</p>

<p>Is there any evidence (in either the show or books) for any of these? Perhaps there is not yet enough information to give a concrete answer, but if there are any hints given they would be good to know. Both book and show answers are fine, they may even be different.</p>

<p>I have added a map for a better understanding of the distances between the places mentioned in the question, all the places are in the lower third, two on the east side of Westeros and the other on the west.<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xA0b1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/xA0b1.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>
","<game-of-thrones>","166193","<p>There's a few gaps in your assumptions that can give Euron a window to do what he does.</p>

<p>Note that I'm forgoing spoiler tags as this entire answer is one big spoiler.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We see Euron's Iron fleet wreck Yara and Theon's Iron fleet. I assume this happened <strong>between Dragonstone and King's landing</strong>, but could be mistaken.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looking at the map you posted, there's no reason for Yara to sail towards King's Landing (Blackwater Bay in general).<br>
<em>Although this is an assumption on my part, the fact that the Sand Snakes were cozy in their hammocks and Yara was having a drink with Ellaria, it stands to reason that they had been travelling some time. So I doubt that the ambush took place near Blackwater Bay.</em></p>

<p>However, looking at the route from Dragonstone to <strong>Sunspear</strong> (their intended destination), it seems there are a few locations that are hard to avoid. Keep in mind that it's significantly easier to sail by staying close to shore (visual aid), rather than having to rely on compasses or astronomy. </p>

<p>Euron could have been waiting for them at one of the unavoidable points, e.g. the entrance to the sea of Dorne, or the eastern cape just south of the sea of Dorne. Any route that avoid these points will be incredibly convoluted, and it seems clear that Yara wasn't expecting hostile interaction on the way (so it makes no sense for her to take such a convoluted route then)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How did he manage to get from one side of Westeros to the other so quickly, assuming as it is portrayed on the show that both of the fleets under Dany's command left at the same or similar times.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would be more accurate to say that Grey Worm and Yara's fleets started <strong>preparing</strong> for their journey at the same time.<br>
Looking at the map once again, if Yara and Grey Worm left at the same time, they must have been travelling together, since Sunspear is on the way to Casterly Rock.</p>

<p>Yara's mission was to <strong>fetch</strong> Dornish soldiers. Logically, she must have left with relatively empty ships, so that the Dornish can be added (without needing to leave others behind, which would defeat the purpose). That requires little preparation time.</p>

<p>Grey Worm's mission was to <strong>send</strong> soldiers. This means that a lot more preparation time is needed. Provisioning the boats, loading the men, ...</p>

<p>It also seems fair to consider that the Greyjoys are the most adept sailors compared to everyone else, so it's very likely that they can mobilize faster than others. This can apply to both <strong>Yara and Euron</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>New conclusions</h2>

<p>Let me rewrite your interpretation according to the differences I've addressed.</p>

<ul>
<li>Yara leaves before Grey Worm, due to less preparation time and having worthy sailors as a crew.</li>
<li>Euron waits for Yara at given location and ambushes her.</li>
<li>Euron sends his fleet to Casterly Rock (he himself took a trip to King's Landing if you remember)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two options here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Euron's fleet could have left for Casterly Rock before Grey Worm. This makes it likely that they were again waiting to ambush Grey Worm, and were even there before him.</li>
<li>Maybe Grey Worm had already progressed further when Euron's fleet departed for the Rock, but since Euron ambushed Yara somewhere between Dragonstone and Sunspear (which is en route to Casterly Rock), then Euron's fleet had less distance to travel than Grey Worm did. If you combine the Greyjoy sailing aptitude, shorter travel distance, and Grey Worm's time needed to take Casterly Rock after their sailing trip; then this should give Euron's fleet more than enough time to catch up.</li>
</ul>

<p>Regardless of the options, I think the relatively unmentioned but important preparation time for Grey Worm's fleet to depart gave Euron enough time to attack both fleets.</p>

"166300","Are King in the North and Lord of Winterfell two different entities now?","<p>In S07E03, Sansa said</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> to Bran: ""You are father's last living trueborn son, you're Lord of Winterfell
 now.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She doesn't say that He's King in the North, which implies that she accepts that Jon is KitN and that's final. But at the same time, she believes that the above mentioned character is Lord of Winterfell now.</p>

<p>Historically, KitN have also been Lords of Winterfell but Sansa's statement contradicts that. Are the two considered different entities now? If Yes, Did Sansa consider herself Lady of Winterfell as Eddard Stark's last living trueborn child while Jon remains her Overlord as KitN? If the two offices are different, that seems to be the case apparently. If not her, who holds the title of Lord of Winterfell now? Jon? Sansa at least doesn't think he does. Legally she may have a point, while Jon somehow got elected as KitN  and didn't inherit it as he wasn't trueborn, that means Winterfell would pass following the accepted laws of succession which essentially means her. </p>

<p>TLDR, Are KitN and Lord of Winterfell considered different titles in Show-verse now?</p>

<p>PS: I understand that's not how things work/worked in the Books so let's keep it limited to Show-verse. </p>
","<game-of-thrones><laws>","166605","<h3>I'm of the opinion that they've always been separate entities.</h3>

<p>Jon Snow at the end of Season 6 makes it very clear that Sansa is the Lady of Winterfell. Jon never took up the Lordship of Winterfell.</p>
<p>This is visible both here in the script, and on the following clip on youtube.</p>

</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Some quibbles that have come up while discussing this with Skooba.</p>
<h3><em>Sansa did not consider herself Lady of Winterfell.</em></h3>
<p>This is incorrect. In the video above Sansa says Jon should have the lord room. She never objects to being the Lady of Winterfell, if she ever had, she accepted it pretty quick.</p>
<h3><em>Only when Jon leaves does she have any say... any REAL say</em></h3>
<p>Jon puts her in charge. He specifically says &quot;<em>you're in command now</em>&quot; That doesn't mean she's in charge of Winterfell now. What good would that do? Especially when the King and the Hand are gone. He's clearly giving her control of the North. Stand-in King of the North if you will.</p>
<p><strong><em>The other Lords seem to think they have a say</em></strong></p>
<p>She never had no say, she respects her half-brother, she's questioned his decision but accepted that he's in charge. In fact, no Lords really had any other say, all of them have no say, at most they question him, but as it was in the most recent episode, the decision is his, an no one else's.</p>
<h3><em>Jon had the kiddie lords swear fealty to House Stark</em></h3>
<p>He did, as that's his family. Swearing fealty to House Stark not only provides the benefit to his sister, the Lady. But also ensures they're in line with his family and allegiances.</p>
<h3><em>You dont get to &quot;choose&quot; to be KitN. The Boltons could do what they did because the Stark line was expected to be extinct, notice how they moved to Winterfell once they took power.</em></h3>
<p>You most definitely could not &quot;choose&quot; to be King in the North. That was something you had to be elected to become. Jon Snow was elected and so was Robb. They both had to be accepted by their Lords (and/or Ladies) to become King in the North.</p>

"166366","Was Ned Stark actually a good swordsman?","<p>Inspired by this question (<a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/87012/is-there-any-proof-that-jaime-lannister-is-actually-a-good-swordsman"">Is there any proof that Jaime Lannister is actually a good swordsman?</a>), the OP mentions Ned in a way that he thinks Ned is a great swordsman. I don't recall anything from the books or show that indicate anything at all about his swordsmanship, he's usually talked about it terms of his honor, or skill as a commander.  Aside from vague ""we were great once, Ned"" comments from Robert (and weren't we <em>all</em> great in our youth? :) ), what evidence do we have that Ned was notable as a swordsman?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","166367","<h3>Books Answer</h3>
<p>No there is no such proof or indication about Ned's talents.</p>
<p>He was an aristocrat so obviously he received martial training but never quite shone like many other big names of Westeros.</p>
<p>As you noted, he is known for his honesty and honor, not for his skills as a fighter.</p>
<p>He must have been good enough however as he fought directly in many battles including the raid at Tower of Joy but there is no evidence suggesting that he was a great warrior.</p>
<p>Others like Jaime, Arthur Dayne, Barristan Selmy, Loras Tyrell, Garlan Tyrell, Oberyn Martell, Lyn Corbray, Qhorin Halfhand etc are all described as exceptionally gifted. Even Robert was counted as a great warrior once. The same has never been said about Ned.</p>
<p>And he is not alone in it, the same has never been said about Tywin Lannister, Jon Arryn or Hoster Tully either. Mace Tyrell is explicitly called out as an incompetent Commander. I am actually glad that ASOIAF doesn't follow the silly tropes that the <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterSwordsman"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>Good Guy</em></a> (there are no good guys in the series but that's how some people view Ned) is supposed to be a great warrior, oh and warning, TV Tropes link. Ned has other redeeming talents, he was great at administration and laws.</p>
<p>So in conclusion, there is neither any evidence, nor a claim in the first place that Eddard was among the biggest fighting stars of Westeros.</p>
<p>And I have found a <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/FAQ/Entry/How_good_a_swordsman_was_Ned"" rel=""noreferrer"">Citadel entry on this same question</a>. This is what GRRM is reported to have said himself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GRRM has previously stated that Eddard was a competent swordsman.
However, Brandon was the real swordsman in the family (SSC).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If George says he was a competent (and therefore not an exceptional one) swordsman, I guess that settles it. Good enough but not Excellent.</p>

<hr />
<p>Daenerys was predisposed to accept Ironborn independence in S06E09:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Daenerys: You've brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet with men to
sail them. In return, <strong>I expect you want me to support your claim to
the throne of the Iron Islands?</strong></p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Theon: He [Euron] murdered our father and would have murdered us.
He'll murder you as soon as you have what he wants. The Seven
Kingdoms. All of them.</p>
<p>Dany: And you don't want the Seven Kingdoms?</p>
<p>Yara: Your ancestors defeated ours and took the Iron Islands. We ask
you to give them back.</p>
<p>Dany: And that's all?</p>
<p>Yara: We'd like you to help us murder an uncle or two who don't think
a woman's fit to rule.</p>
<p>Dany: Reasonable.</p>
<p>Tyrion: <strong>What if everyone starts demanding their independence?</strong></p>
<p>Dany: <strong>She's not demanding, she's asking. The others are free to ask as</strong>
<strong>well.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So at that point, she appeared to be willing to accept secession of individual Kingdoms from Iron Throne.</p>
<p>To be fair she did ask the Greyjoys this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms and respect
the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms. No more reaving, roving, raiding,
or raping.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is kind of vague and open to interpretations (Something which good diplomats always keep an eye out for while conducting negotiations).</p>
<p>If some clause or condition is open to interpretations, that often leads to break down in negotiations e.g. IRL in Prelude to Crimean war, a treaty proposed by Great Powers to reduce threat of war between Ottoman Empire and Russian Empire was rejected by Ottomans as some clauses were vague and open to varying interpretations.</p>
<p>So If Yara is supposed to accept her as Queen of the Seven Kingdoms and respect the integrity of <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/135439/54887"">the Seven Kingdoms</a>, she can't bloody well secede, can she? And while Daenerys said others were free to ask as well, she never said that she will allow them.</p>
<p>In S07E02 We see:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tyrion: I can't speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I
like Jon Snow and I trusted him. And I am an excellent judge of
character. If he does rule the North, he would make a valuable ally.
The Lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his
brother. Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do.</p>
<p>Daenerys: Very well. Send a raven north. <strong>Tell Jon Snow that his
queen invites him to come to Dragonstone and bend the knee</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here she is not even willing to view him as an ally, she wants him to bend the knee and be her subject, contrary to her earlier position re the Ironborn.</p>
<p>In S0703 She said:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Jon: <strong>And why would I do that?</strong> I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I
don't know you. As far as I can tell, your claim to the throne rests
entirely on your father's name, and my own father fought to overthrow
the Mad King. The lords of the North placed their trust in me to lead
them, and I will continue to do so as well as I can.</p>

<p>Isles and Rivers (Later both were separated into Iron Islands and Riverlands) was one of the 7 Kingdoms Aegon the Conqueror took. So what about the westernmost Kingdom? What gives?</p>
<p>Why be prepared to let the Iron-Islands secede but pressure the Northmen to accept her as Queen? If Torrhen Stark swore a vow to be subject to Aegon the Conqueror and his heirs and successors, so did Vickon Greyjoy. Was she just fooling the Greyjoys with vaguely worded promises?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","166492","<p>This is using later obtained information to back into an answer but I think this is another instance of Daenerys ""Giving her something by giving her nothing"". </p>

<p>Daenerys needs Yara's ships to have enough naval power to cross the Narrow Sea and effectively combat the remaining Iron Fleet under command of Euron. She <em>does not</em> need the Iron Island. It has always been described a quite desolate place that <em>has</em> to resort to raiding and pillaging just to survive. There is practically nothing Yara has to offer besides the ships. By letting Yara call herself ""Queen"" Daenerys gets the ships and, as you mentioned, has promise to stop the only threat the Iron Islands ever really posed (raiding, etc). </p>

<p>Daenrys needs allies, so she was ""negotiating an alliance"", but in the end it was just ""something for nothing"".</p>

<hr>

<p>The North on the other hand is larger than all the other kingdoms combined. Currently it also has one the strongest armies in Westeros. The Northmen are known to be fierce fighters, and are now allied with the ""savage"" Free Folk, and have the Lords of Vale in their corner as well. The Vale is of particular concern because their ranks were not decimated by the War of Five Kings (and are known as one of the best trained forces to begin with). </p>

<p>Jon as King in the North poses a real threat... what if he were to decide that since ""Winter has Come"" that he should sit the Iron Throne...</p>

"166691","Why didn't Tullys just order Freys to let the northmen through the bridge?","<p>Walder Frey gives specific conditions which the Starks have to accept if they want to cross. But the Freys are the bannermen of the Tullys! And Tullys are strongly connected to Starks because of Catelyn, who was born a Tully. </p>

<p>Isn't that the way it's supposed to be: that houses obey the words of the lords to whom they've sworn allegiance? Or is it not like that?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","166728","<h3>Oaths are words, Words are wind</h3>
<p>Catelyn Stark answered your question when Robb wondered the same. If Freys are bannermen to Tullys, they ought to let Starks pass.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Walder Frey, Lord of the Crossing, had assembled a force of near four
thousand men at his castles on the Green Fork.</p>
<p>“Late again,” Catelyn murmured when she heard. It was the Trident all
over, damn the man. Her brother Edmure had called the banners; by
rights, Lord Frey should have gone to join the Tully host at Riverrun,
yet here he sat.</p>
<p>“Four thousand men,” Robb repeated, more perplexed than angry. “Lord
Frey cannot hope to fight the Lannisters by himself. Surely he means
to join his power to ours.”</p>
<p>“Does he?” Catelyn asked. She had ridden forward to join Robb and
Robett Glover, his companion of the day. The vanguard spread out
behind them, a slow-moving forest of lances and banners and spears. “I
wonder. <strong>Expect nothing of Walder Frey, and you will never be</strong>
<strong>surprised.</strong>”</p>
<p><strong>&quot;He's your father's bannerman.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Some men take their oaths more seriously than others, Robb</strong>. And Lord
Walder was always friendlier with Casterly Rock than my father would
have liked. One of his sons is wed to Tywin Lannister's sister. That
means little of itself, to be sure. Lord Walder has sired a great many
children over the years, and they must needs marry someone. Still
…&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>AGOT - Catelyn IX</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Inside the dark corner called Walder's mind</h3>
<p>In the same chapter, she also explained how Lord Walder's mind works:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Do you think he means to betray us to the Lannisters, my lady?&quot;
Robett Glover asked gravely.</p>
<p>Catelyn sighed. &quot;If truth be told, <strong>I doubt even Lord Frey knows what</strong>
<strong>Lord Frey intends to do.</strong> He has an old man's caution and a young man's
ambition, and has never lacked for cunning.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Precedent for vassals turning against Overlords in favor of Crown</h3>
<p>Earlier, Catelyn wondered where the loyalties of her Father's bannermen lie:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Her father was the staunchest man who'd ever lived, and she had no
doubt that he would call his banners … but would the banners come? The
<strong>Darrys and Rygers and Mootons had sworn oaths to Riverrun as well, yet</strong>
<strong>they had fought with Rhaegar Targaryen on the Trident</strong>, while Lord Frey
had arrived with his levies well after the battle was over, leaving
some doubt as to which army he had planned to join (theirs, he had
assured the victors solemnly in the aftermath, but ever after her
father had called him the Late Lord Frey).<br><sub><em><strong>AGOT - Catelyn
V</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Lord Walder's Position</h3>
<p>Lord Frey however said that he wanted to go to Riverrun but he was waiting for his full levies to gather and Edmure lost before that. As to his vows, he correctly points out that he swore vows to the Crown as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Now that I have observed the courtesies, my lady, perhaps my sons
will do me the honor of shutting their mouths. <strong>Why are you here?</strong>”</p>
<p>“<strong>To ask you to open your gates</strong>, my lord,” Catelyn replied politely.
“My son and his lords bannermen are most anxious to cross the river
and be on their way.”</p>
<p>“<strong>To Riverrun?</strong>” He sniggered. “Oh, no need to tell me, no need. I’m not
blind yet. The old man can still read a map.”</p>
<p>“<strong>To Riverrun,</strong>” Catelyn confirmed. She saw no reason to deny it. “<strong>Where</strong>
<strong>I might have expected to find you, my lord. You are still my father’s</strong>
<strong>bannerman, are you not?</strong>”</p>
<p>“Heh, “ said Lord Walder, a noise halfway between a laugh and a grunt.
“<strong>I called my swords, yes I did, here they are, you saw them on the</strong>
<strong>walls. It was my intent to march as soon as all my strength was</strong>
<strong>assembled.</strong> Well, to send my sons. I am well past marching myself, Lady
Catelyn.” He looked around for likely confirmation and pointed to a
tall, stooped man of fifty years. “Tell her, Jared. Tell her that was
my intent.”</p>
<p>“It was, my lady,” said Ser Jared Frey, one of his sons by his second
wife. “On my honor.”</p>
<p>“<strong>Is it my fault that your fool brother lost his battle before we could</strong>
<strong>march?</strong>” He leaned back against his cushions and scowled at her, as if
challenging her to dispute his version of events. “I am told the
Kingslayer went through him like an axe through ripe cheese. Why
should my boys hurry south to die? All those who did go south are
running north again.”<br><sub><em><strong>AGOT - Catelyn IX</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>We want to cross</strong>,” Catelyn told him.</p>
<p>“Oh, do you? That’s blunt. <strong>Why should I let you?</strong>”</p>
<p>For a moment her anger flared. “If you were strong enough to climb
your own battlements,  Lord Frey, <strong>you would see that my son has twenty thousand men outside</strong>
your walls.”</p>
<p>“<strong>They’ll be twenty thousand fresh corpses when Lord Tywin gets here</strong>,”
the old man shot back. “Don’t you try and frighten me, my lady. Your
husband’s in some traitor’s cell under the Red Keep, your father’s
sick, might be dying, and Jaime Lannister’s got your brother in
chains. <strong>What do you have that I should fear</strong>? That son of yours? I’ll
match you son for son, and I’ll still have eighteen when yours are all
dead.”</p>
<p>“<strong>You swore an oath to my father</strong>,” Catelyn reminded him.</p>
<p>He bobbed his head side to side, smiling. “Oh, yes, I said some words,
<strong>but I swore oaths to the crown too, it seems to me. Joffrey’s the king</strong>
now, and that makes you and your boy and all those fools out there no
better than rebels. If I had the sense the gods gave a fish, I’d help
the Lannisters boil you all.”<br><sub><em><strong>AGOT - Catelyn IX</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Lord Walder Remembers</h3>
<p>Then he expressed his resentment on various insults by House Tully:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Your lord father did not come to the wedding.</strong> An insult, as I see it.
Even if he is dying. He never came to my last wedding either. <strong>He calls</strong>
<strong>me the Late Lord Frey</strong>, you know. Does he think I’m dead? I’m not dead,
and I promise you, I’ll outlive him as I outlived his father. <strong>Your</strong>
<strong>family has always pissed on me</strong>, don’t deny it, don’t lie, you know
it’s true. Years ago, <strong>I went to your father and suggested a match</strong>
<strong>between his son and my daughter</strong>. Why not? I had a daughter in mind,
sweet girl, only a few years older than Edmure, but if your brother
didn’t warm to her, I had others he might have had, young ones, old
ones, virgins, widows, whatever he wanted. <strong>No, Lord Hoster would not</strong>
<strong>hear of it</strong>. Sweet words he gave me, excuses, but what I wanted was to
get rid of a daughter.</p>
<p>“<strong>And your sister, that one, she’s full as bad.</strong></p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>I proposed that Lord and Lady Arryn <strong>foster two of my grandsons</strong> at
court, and offered to <strong>take their own son to ward here at the Twins</strong>.
Are my grandsons unworthy to be seen at the king’s court?</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p><strong>Lord Arryn wouldn’t have him, or the other one, and I blame your lady</strong>
<strong>sister for that</strong>. She frosted up as if I’d suggested selling her boy to
a mummer’s show or making a eunuch out of him<br><sub><em><strong>AGOT - Catelyn IX</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>So in conclusion:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lord Walder is a cautious man who takes no unnecessary risks. Why should he take field for a side that was losing?</li>
<li>Lord Walder is legally bound to follow his liege lord but he is also legally bound to be faithful to the Crown. Of course vows mean little to a man like him, he has never been overly conscious about them. But there is precedent, in previous wars against the Crown, many Lords forswore their local overlords and fought for the King.</li>
<li>He has Kinship with Lord Tywin. Lord Tywin's beloved sister Genna Lannister is his daughter-in-law. He can be sure that even if Tywin Lannister destroys everyone else, House Frey will be secure, leaving him little to worry about.</li>
<li>Walder Frey could only sense ruin in Tully camp, why should he join it? Any Tully Power which could exact retribution is shattered by Jaime. Of course he is not blind, the Starks were here and sooner or later it was expected Arryns would be here as well. Together, they gave the Tullys a winning chance but to enter Riverlands without risking a battle with Tywin Lannister at Ruby Ford, they needed Lord of the Crossing which gave him enormous leverage, something he wasn't willing to give up for nothing. Now was the time to get something in return.</li>
<li>Lord Walder is not overly fond of Tullys, Starks, Arryns or Lannister. He hates that they all look down upon him. He hates that Lord Hoster Tully didn't take his daughter as daughter in law. He hates that Arryns refused to foster his grand kids.</li>
</ol>
<p>So TLDR, Tullys could order the Freys but would the Freys listen? Unlikely.</p>

"166796","Is the river that Jaime falls into real?","<p>This question has been bothering me ever since I watched the ending of the fourth episode of season 7 (<em>The Spoils of War</em>).</p>

<p>Jaime charges towards Daenerys and Drogon. He is charging along the bank of a river; so, it seems that the water is obviously not that deep (maybe ~0.1 Jaime Lannister). Now, someone hurls him from his horse and they fall into the water, and suddenly, the river seems deeper than seven Jaime Lannisters (see below screenshot).</p>

<p>The point at which he falls isn't that far from where the horse was riding along the bank. So my question is - do real rivers behave like this? That kind of gradient seems scary if it can be real. And if so, does anyone know of any particular rivers that might do this?</p>

Indeed, it was Lord Jon's refusal to deliver the heads of his wards, Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon, that began the revolt. Had he done as he was commanded, the Mad King might yet sit the Iron Throne.</p>

<li><p>The Arryns supported the Crown during the Blackfyre Rebllions in times earlier than we see in the books/show. </p>

  <p>The Arryns played their part in the wars of the Targaryen kings, and in the Blackfyre rebellions, standing stoutly with the Iron Throne against the Blackfyre Pretenders.</p>
  
  <p>-<em>The World of Ice and Fire - The Vale: House Arryn</em></p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Those keeping the Vale out of the recent wars had ulterior motives</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>To make alliances during Robert's Rebellion, Ned Stark was wed to Caitlyn Tully while Lysa Tully was wed to Jon Arryn. This cemented the Baratheon-Stark-Tully-Arryn rebels which were the main force against the Targaryen-Tyrell-Martell loyalists.  </p></li>
<li><p>This changed during the War of the Five Kings due to Petyr Baelish manipulating Lysa Arryn (née Tully) into killing her own husband, betraying her sister, and keeping the Vale out of the conflict by design. </p></li>
<li><p>Baelish's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36WgsCx7TwM"" rel=""noreferrer"">master plan</a> is revealed to be ""a picture of me [Petyr] on the Iron Throne, and you [Sansa] by my side"". This is the only reason the Knights of the Vale rode to side with the Starks in the Battle of the Bastards as Baelish has maneuvered himself to be Lord Regent of House Arryn.</p></li>

"166943","Why did Lannisters send Alton back to Starks camp after he came to King's Landing?","<p>Alton Lannister appears in season 2 of Game of Thrones. He's sent by the Starks to King's Landing to bring Robb Stark's peace terms.</p>

<p>My question is: why did they send a Lannister, a member of their own family, back to the Starks, so that he could be their hostage? Wouldn't it be better to sent just a less important common sellsword or seriously anyone else but Alton?</p>

<p>This  decision costs the Lannisters a life, cause Alton is later killed by Jaime, who wants to escape from the camp. If they sent another person, Alton Lannister would be alive and well.</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","166947","<h1>Show:</h1>

<p>It's not made clear. It's possible Cersei assumed that a Lannister would be put in the same cage as Jaime, giving Jaime a change in situation he could use to his advantage. It's also possible the show's creators didn't really think it through, and wanted us to have a brief connection to the character (via his squire story) before killing him.</p>

<hr>

<h1>Books:</h1>

<p>It isn't Alton Lannister who makes the trip; it's a different Lannister cousin, Ser Cleos Frey. The difference is slight, but crucial: Ser Cleos swears to the Starks on his honor as a knight that he would return, after delivering their terms, to become their captive again. Cersei and Tyrion (the acting Hand of the King at the time) know they have to send <em>someone</em> with their counterterms, and Ser Cleos wants to keep his oath, so he returns to the Starks.</p>

<p>In that case, considering the current situation in Westeros as of season 7 (or as of book 5 + released chapters of book 6), <strong>how does this get proven in the eyes of the lords, ladies, and commoners of Westeros?</strong></p>

<p>It feels like an impossible claim to prove given that Eddard Stark is dead, Howland Reed seems to have vanished off the face of Planetos, and anyone else who was alive at the time with that knowledge appears to be dead and gone. EVEN IF Howland Reed manages to crawl out of the woodwork to corroborate Bran/3-eyed Raven's claim (assuming he even makes that claim) about Jon's true heritage, we're still just talking about the word of two relatively unknown (outside of the North) Westerosi noblemen.</p>

<p>The only way I can see of ""proving"" anything is if Jon ends up riding a dragon. But even then, would that, in addition to the theoretical claims of Howland Reed and Bran Stark be enough to prove that Jon Snow is actually Jon Targaryan (assuming R and L actually got married, and assuming that marriage is even recognized in the eyes of Westeros since polygamy is very much looked down upon...) ?</p>

<p><strong>I am looking for theories or speculation based on the books, the TV show or historical events that end up with the people of Westeros generally accepting that Jon Snow is either:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p><s><strong>Still a bastard of different heritage, or</strong></s></p></li>
<li><p><strong>A legitimate Targaryan, and trueborn heir of Rhaegar
Targaryan.</strong></p></li>

<p><strong>Edit based on S7E05:</strong></p>

<p>In the scene where Sam decides he's had it with the silly Citadel, Gilly reads an old record of <strong>Rhaegar Targaryan receiving an annulment of his marriage to Elia Martell, and of his remarriage to... Lyanna Stark?</strong></p>

<p>Assuming this is true, and assuming Jon Snow is indeed their offspring, then he is indeed a true-born Targaryan. Now as to how to prove it, obviously this record would come in handy when attempting to do so...</p>

<ol>
<li>Howland Reed, being present at the Tower of Joy has first account of what transpired. The proof is that he is well respected noble lord and has no reason to lie about such things as he was on the opposing side of the Targaryen's during the rebellion. </li>
<li>Brandon Stark has ""green-seer"" vision in which he has ascertained this information. The proof is a bit harder here as magic is going to be looked on with a certain degree of skepticism. However, if Bran can prove he knows other things (e.g. ""Chaos is a ladder) that he would no other way of knowing, people may tend to believe him.</li>
<li>High Septon Maynard <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caVpP169KiQ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">issued an annulment</a> of Prince Rhaegar's marriage. While we do not 100% know, yet, that this means he married Lyanna Stark, all arrows point in the right direction. This is crucial as it wasn't just any old Septon, but <em>The High Septon</em>! This lends the religious authority to have Jon be a legitimate Targaryen. Even though the Sept of Baelor was destroyed, the Faith of the Seven is still the dominate religion in Westeros. Cersei may not want to hear it, but many lords and common folk will take the record seriously. </li>
<li>Jon being <a href=""https://youtu.be/uT8aECFHIvU?t=34s"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""dragon sensitive""</a>. I think we saw some this in S7E5 as well, when Daenerys returns to Dragonstone and Jon reaches out to Drogon. This is more speculative than the rest at this point, but seems like it will pan out. It is generally accepted that you need the blood of Old Valyria (i.e. Targaryen) to have this affinity with dragons. Update for S8E1.... Jon boi being flying now.</li>

<p>During this time, Arya is Tywin's cupbearer and is the only person, who's allowed to be in the room, as a servant.</p>

<p>There is a huge hint that Petyr actually recognized Arya. It's at the time when Arya accidentally spills wine next to Littlefinger.</p>

"98826","Do fighters in the Game Of Thrones books not wear helmets?","<p>I just watched <em>Game of Thrones</em> HBO Season 4, and after the trial by combat (where one duelist wears a helmet, and the outcome might've been different if they both had), I noticed that later combats too had several people in armor but no helmets which had a lot of head injury (hammer through skull, head vs. anvil, people in full armor but no helmets punching each other in the face). All of these situations would have been affected by wearing helmets. </p>

<p>I'm wondering if this is just a video thing (creators assume audience wants to see faces), or if in the books, too, these people and others are often wearing full armor but no helmets and suffering for it.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><adaptation-comparison>","98861","<p>Sometimes there are advantages of being lightly armored. When Bronn fought Ser Vardis Egen as Tyrion Lannister's champion at Eyrie, Bronn was lightly armored and he was able to tire Ser Vardis Egen out. Ser Vardis Egen was dressed in steel from head to heel and found it hard to move.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ser Vardis Egen was steel from head to heel, encased in heavy plate armor over mail and padded surcoat. Large circular rondels, enameled cream-and-blue in the moon-and-falcon sigil of House Arryn, protected the vulnerable juncture of arm and breast. A skirt of lobstered metal covered him from waist to midthigh, while a solid gorget encircled his throat. Falcon’s wings sprouted from the temples of his helm, and his visor was a pointed metal beak with a narrow slit for vision.</p>
<p>Bronn was so lightly armored he looked almost naked beside the knight. He wore only a shirt of black oiled ringmail over boiled leather, a round steel halfhelm with a noseguard, and a mail coif. High leather boots with steel shinguards gave some protection to his legs, and discs of black iron were sewn into the fingers of his gloves. Yet Catelyn noted that the sellsword stood half a hand taller than his foe, with a longer reach ... and Bronn was fifteen years younger, if she was any judge.</p>
<p><sub><sup>A Game Of Thrones</sub></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fighting with helmet can restrict the vision range for a fighter and there can be other issues as mentioned below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The slot in his helm limited Tyrion’s vision to what was before him, but when he turned his head he saw three galleys beached on the tourney grounds, and a fourth, larger than the others, standing well out into the river, firing barrels of burning pitch from a catapult.</p>
<p>A naked man fell from the sky and landed on the deck, body bursting like a melon dropped from a tower. His blood spattered through the slit of Tyrion’s helm. Stones began to plummet down, crashing through the decks and turning men to pulp, until the whole bridge gave a shudder and twisted violently underfoot, knocking him sideways.</p>
<p>Suddenly the river was pouring into his helm. He ripped it off and crawled along the listing deck until the water was only neck deep.</p>
<p><sub><sup>A Clash of Kings</sub></sup></p>

<h1>Generally in Westeros it is considered to be stupid to fight without a helm (helmet)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>“Don’t be impertinent. Cersei has a royal wedding to plan, I am waging a war, and you have been out of danger for at least a fortnight.” Lord Tywin studied his son’s disfigured face, his pale green eyes unflinching. “Though the wound is ghastly enough, I’ll grant you. What madness possessed you?”</p>
<p>“The foe was at the gates with a battering ram. If Jaime had led the sortie, you’d call it valor.”</p>
<p>“Jaime would never be so foolish as to remove his helm in battle. I trust you killed the man who cut you?”</p>
<p><sub><sup>A Storm of Swords</sub></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Updating the answer to include Tyrion's trial by battle.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tyrion had his own doubts, now that they stood on the brink. When he looked at Prince Oberyn, he found himself wishing he had Bronn defending him . . . or even better, Jaime. The Red Viper was lightly armored; greaves, vambraces, gorget, spaulder, steel codpiece. Elsewise Oberyn was clad in supple leather and flowing silks. Over his byrnie he wore his scales of gleaming copper, but mail and scale together would not give him a quarter the protection of Gregor’s heavy plate. With its visor removed, the prince’s helm was effectively no better than a half- helm, lacking even a nasal. His round steel shield was brightly polished, and showed the sun-and-spear in red gold, yellow gold, white gold, and copper.</p>
<p>Dance around him until he’s so tired he can hardly lift his arm, then put him on his back. The Red Viper seemed to have the same notion as Bronn. But the sellsword had been blunt about the risks of such tactics. I hope to seven hells that you know what you are doing, snake.</p>
<p>Like a serpent’s tongue it flickered in and out, feinting low and landing high, jabbing at groin, shield, eyes. The Mountain makes for a big target, at the least, Tyrion thought. Prince Oberyn could scarcely miss, though none of his blows was penetrating Ser Gregor’s heavy plate. <strong>The Dornishman kept circling, jabbing, then darting back again, forcing the bigger man to turn and turn again. Clegane is losing sight of him.</strong> The Mountain’s helm had a narrow eyeslit, severely limiting his vision. Oberyn was making good use of that, and the length of his spear, and his quickness.</p>

<p>Outside of westeros there are fighting styles which places higher emphasis on speed over safely, these styles of fighting require less armor. <strong>In general, fighters go lightly armored when they are looking for speed.</strong></p>

"167147","Are the ""people"" re-incarnated by the Lord of Light real?","<p>At first glance this question may seem a little weird, but bare with.</p>

<p>I was having a discussion with some people and looking at Beric Dondarrion's <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Beric_Dondarrion"" rel=""noreferrer"">wiki page</a> which shows a video describing Beric. In the video they mention that George R.R. Martin calls Beric a ""<em>fire wight</em>"". If this is anything like the wights of the Army of the Dead, Beric must be just that: dead, but alive. So <em>Un</em>-dead.</p>

<p>If this is true, would that mean all those re-incarnated by the Lord of Light are not actually alive? Is there evidence to suggest Jon Snow is not a real human anymore? If they're not actually alive are they all Fire Wights?</p>

<p>A snippet I've seen of an interview with GRRM seems to confirm the Beric isn't alive:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>His heart isn’t beating, his blood isn’t flowing in his veins, he’s a wight, but a wight animated by fire instead of by ice, now we’re getting back to the whole fire and ice thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there evidence to suggest that this applies to just Beric or is everyone who's been re-incarnated actually <em>(un)dead</em>?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><jon-snow>","167149","<p>TL;DR - From the books perspective it seems that all those brought back by The Lord of Light are ""undead"". The shows perspective is not as clear. </p>

<hr>

<p>The quote you have provided was part of a larger <a href=""http://time.com/4791258/game-of-thrones-george-r-r-martin-interview/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Time interview</a>. Here it is in context: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q: <strong>Did Lady Stoneheart come about because it was hard to say a permanent goodbye to Catelyn?</strong></p>
  
  <p>A: Yeah, maybe. That may have been part of it. Part of it was also, it’s the dialogue that I was talking about. And here I’ve got to get back to Tolkien again. And I’m going to seem like I’m criticizing him, which I guess I am. It’s always bothered me that Gandalf comes back from the dead. The Red Wedding for me in Lord of the Rings is the mines of Moria, and when Gandalf falls — it’s a devastating moment! I didn’t see it coming at 13 years old, it just totally took me by surprise. Gandalf can’t die! He’s the guy that knows all of the things that are happening! He’s one of the main heroes here! Oh god, what are they going to do without Gandalf? Now it’s just the hobbits?! And Boromir, and Aragorn? Well, maybe Aragorn will do, but it’s just a huge moment. A huge emotional investment.
  And then in the next book, he shows up again, and it was six months between the American publications of those books, which seemed like a million years to me. So all that time I thought Gandalf was dead, and now he’s back and now he’s Gandalf the White. And, ehh, he’s more or less the same as always, except he’s more powerful. It always felt a little bit like a cheat to me. And as I got older and considered it more, i<strong>t also seemed to me that death doesn’t make you more powerful.</strong> That’s, in some ways, me talking to Tolkien in the dialogue, saying, <strong>“Yeah, if someone comes back from being dead, especially if they suffer a violent, traumatic death, they’re not going to come back as nice as ever.""</strong> That’s what I was trying to do, and am still trying to do, with the Lady Stoneheart character.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Q: And Jon Snow, too, is drained by the experience of coming back from the dead on the show.</strong></p>
  
  <p>Right. And <strong>poor Beric Dondarrion, who was set up as the foreshadowing of all this</strong>, every time he’s a little less Beric. His memories are fading, he’s got all these scars, he’s becoming more and more physically hideous, <strong>because he’s not a living human being anymore.</strong> His heart isn’t beating, his blood isn’t flowing in his veins, he’s a wight, but a wight animated by fire instead of by ice, now we’re getting back to the whole fire and ice thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we see the lead-in is Lady Stoneheart (the prior question was about how the Red Wedding was hardest scene for George to write). That gives us the link that Berric, Caetlyn, and Jon have all been resurrected, and all in the same way. </p>

<p>I tend to look at these answers from George pertain more to his books than the show. He even alludes to that  in the same interview: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>I’ve sat out seasons 6 and 7 too,</strong> just trying to concentrate on this book, which as you know is massively late. So in that sense, my involvement in the show has diminished over time, though, I’m still here whenever they want to talk to me, and I’m always glad to weigh in.</p>
  
  <p>... ...</p>
  
  <p>I think one of the biggest ones would probably be when they made the decision not to bring Catelyn Stark back as Lady Stoneheart. That was probably the first major diversion of the show from the books and, you know, I argued against that, and David and Dan made that decision.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We know Jon has not been brought yet back in the books, this seems to major a plot point to change. However, Jon does seem ""alive"" (we see take some big gasps of air when is first revived) in the show and since Lady Stoneheart was cut from the show. Dan and Dave may not follow the whole ""fire wight"" path.</p>

<p>I would think that it would be easier to pierce armor that way, since a sharp point at the end of the hammer provides more pressure, which i assume is necessary to penetrate thick armor?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>War hammers were developed as a consequence of the prevalence of surface-hardened steel surfacing of wrought iron armors of the late medieval battlefields during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The surface of armors had become as hard as the edge of a blade, so blades tended to ricochet. Swords and battleaxes were likely to give only glancing blows, losing much of their impact, especially on the high curvature of helmets. <strong>A war hammer could deliver the full force of a blow to the target.</strong></p>
<p>War hammers, especially when mounted on a pole, could damage without penetrating armor. <strong>In particular, they transmitted their impact through even the thickest helmets and caused concussions.</strong> Later war hammers often had a spike on one side of the head, making them more versatile weapons.</p>

<p>I found this scene very weird, when Brienne is <s>training</s> kicking Pod's ass, Arya comes and interrupts the session out of nowhere, only to reveal she's a very good fighter to the point where she can beat Brienne.</p>

<p>Why would she do that?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><character-motivation>","167268","<p>The most important part of that conversation would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brienne: I can go and find the master of arms for you, my lady.</p>
<p>Arya: He didn't beat the Hound. You did.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My own interpretation was that given Arya's character, it can be read in a combination of (at least) three ways:</p>
<h3>Arya wants to improve</h3>
<p>Throughout the books/series she's been continually pushing herself. It started by badgering Ned until he'd let her train with Syrio Forel. Even after leaving King's Landing, and generally going through hell, she kept training by herself.</p>
<p>After she met the Faceless Man, she went through an awful lot of trouble to learn their skills.</p>
<p>In the context of her jumping at every chance to make herself stronger, training with the fighter who beat the Hound (a brutal and effective killer) makes perfect sense.</p>
<h3>Brienne killed the Hound</h3>
<p>In case anyone did not notice yet: Arya holds grudges. The Hound is a bit of a special case though: while he holds a place on her (s)hit list for killing the butcher's boy, he also was her companion for quite some time.</p>
<p>For both reasons, she'd be pissed someone else killed him. Her attitude to conflicting feelings generally seems to be to tackle them head on.</p>
<p>It's also not unlikely that in her mind, fighters are measured by how they'd stack up against the Hound. Beating Brienne indirectly means she's beating the Hound.</p>
<h3>Arya wants to establish herself</h3>
<p>In my opinion the weakest of the interpretations, but worth a mention. She's always been the little, useless sister to Sansa. Kicking ass and taking names is one way to point out that little sister ceased to be useless. Bonus points for giving the middle finger to all those ladylike skills she's always despised.</p>

"167287","Why would Arya Stark not disguise her face during these investigations?","<p>In episode 7-5, <em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastwatch"" rel=""noreferrer"">Eastwatch</a></em>, Arya follows Peter ""Littlefinger"" Baelish around Winterfell, suspicious of his intentions. During some of those moments, she seems half visible. Littlefinger receives a raven scroll from Maester Wolkan, and leaves it locked inside his room before leaving. Arya breaks into the locked room, finds the scroll, and discovers that it is the letter written from Sansa (under duress from Cersei) following the death of King Robert, asking her family to swear fealty to King Joffrey. Arya leaves the room, unaware that Littlefinger is watching her from the shadows.</p>

            </div></div></p>

<p><strong>Why would she not wear a face-mask as the Faceless Men do?</strong></p>

<p>We saw in episode 7-1, <em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonstone_(Game_of_Thrones)"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dragonstone</a></em>, that she has the skills to make a face-mask and impersonate people because she made a mask from Walder Frey's face. She might have hidden several face-masks in a travel bag before she left Braavos. Her choice seems even riskier when you consider she <strong>already has the face-mask of a young woman with her</strong>. She wore it in an earlier episode when she killed Walder Frey.</p>

<p><div class=""youtube-embed""><div>

            </div></div></p>

<p>A face-mask would allow her to impersonate a stable boy or a chambermaid without arousing the suspicions of Littlefinger. A stable boy could wander about Winterfell without a second thought from anybody. A chambermaid could go into a guestroom - with permission - to change the sheets or clean the room and not arouse suspicion. Arya as herself did arouse suspicion when she entered Littlefinger's guestroom.</p>

","<game-of-thrones><character-motivation>","167292","<p>There are two parts to this: would wearing a stranger's face like that of the Frey serving girl be the smart, rational thing to do here, and if yes, would Arya <em>do</em> the smart, rational thing here?</p>

<p>Possibly not based on what Arya knows. She was accosted at the gate for seemingly being a commoner the guards didn't recognise. The guards may have been pretty useless, but this does demonstrate that the guards and others don't take kindly to unfamiliar strangers walking around.</p>

<p>As Arya Stark, she can go anywhere. As a random commoner no-one recognises, she risks causing commotion, possibly even being mistaken for a hostile spy or a thief.</p>

<p>Unless of course she murders a random Winterfell resident to take a recognisable face. Book Arya is practically a textbook case study in clinical sociopathy and might well do this as casually as she killed that seemingly Stark-loyal House Bolton guard in Harrenhall; but for TV-show Arya, it'd be out of character for her to murder an innocent Stark servant so soon after coming home.</p>

<h2>If it was smart, would she do it?</h2>

<p>Arya is intelligent and <em>capable</em> of figuring out what the smart thing to do is - but she's also hot-headed, impulsive, and arrogant about her own abilities. She often doesn't <em>choose</em> the smart thing. Here, it'd require two things:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Arya to plan ahead and take safety precautions</strong>: ""Littlefinger is up to something. I should go on a reconnaissance mission and find out what he's doing. What situations might I encounter on such a mission? Hmm, I might need to do something like break into his room, and he might spot me. I should put a face on, as a precaution""</li>
<li><strong>Arya to recognise limits to her abilities</strong>: ""...because this could be a trap or a trick, and I might make mistakes or not be as stealthy as I think I am, and it's possible I might be observed and not realise it""</li>
</ul>

<p>These don't sound much like Arya. She sometimes makes plans, but has she ever planned for the <em>consequences</em> of her actions, or recognised the limits of her abilities? She's more often impulsively charging in head first, often nearly getting killed. Even when she's following her training and executing a complex assassination plan, she's easily distracted (e.g. Meryn Trant) or unable to resist risky gloating before killing her victims.</p>

<p>The way Arya is played is interesting from a storytelling point of view. She's presented like the type of relatable protagonist we can't help rooting for - and <em>usually</em> in fiction, these characters are the type whose actions tend to be what the audience imagines they might do. They tend to be somewhat generic hero characters, who do the Right Thing unless it's ""for love"" or some well-signposted personal weakness they overcome bravely and heroically in the final showdown.</p>

<p>That's not Arya. </p>

<p>Almost every season, the storytelling leads us down the path of rooting for Arya, thinking ""Yes! She's going to kick ass and kill the baddies and look awesome while doing it!"", then with a jolt she does something to remind us that she's still an impulsive, reckless child with a massive stubborn streak and an extremely black and white world view. </p>

<p>Season 6 was a bit of an exception - but the show loves to build up our hopes then remind us with a crash that character development isn't flicking a switch. Like with Sansa, Jaime, Dany, Jon, Stannis and many others, it shows a new side emerging, then shows us with a bump that the old personality traits and habits didn't just magically disappear overnight,  Hollywood-style.</p>

<p>She's more likely to think: ""Littlefinger is up to something. I'll follow him, right now. I'm a super smart super assassin (right?), much cleverer than he is (right?) and everyone loves me here (right?). What could possibly go wrong?""</p>

<hr>

<p>After the Season 7 finale:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> That trend of building her up to be the cool vengeful assassin only for her to go off in a wildly different direction is nicely inverted, but we still have the question, was Arya fooled by or fooling Littlefinger at this point? <br/><br/> There's no firm answer either way, but there's a clue in <a href=""https://movies.stackexchange.com/a/79856/9718"">a deleted scene described in this answer</a>: Sansa came to Bran and begged him for help before the trial scene. <br/><br/>The fact she needed to ask Bran for help, rather than, say, simply having another secret planning meeting with Arya, suggests that the mistrust and tension between the Stark sisters was genuine and Sansa was afraid of both Arya and Littlefinger until, with Bran's help, the sisters came together. <br/><br/> This would suggest Arya didn't know she was being played by Littlefinger at the moment she found this letter, and so the arguments with Sansa weren't just to let Littlefinger think he was winning: she really was angry. This also fits Arya's conciliatory comment after the trial about how she couldn't have endured the things Sansa had. She's taking back her previous barbed comments accusing Sansa of being weak: if these had just been a ruse because they thought Littlefinger was watching, this rare almost-apology wouldn't be necessary.</p>

"167337","Has Nymeria been following Arya this whole time?","<p>I was re-reading A Clash of Kings today and I noticed this passage when Arya snuck far into the forest to make some water:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""
  She was making water, her clothing tangled about her ankles, when she heard rustling from under the trees. Hot Pie, she
  thought in panic, he followed me. Then she saw the eyes shining out from the wood, bright with reflected moonlight. Her belly
  clenched tight as she grabbed for Needle, not caring if she pissed herself, counting eyes, two four eight twelve, a whole pack . .
  .
  One of them came padding out from under the trees. He stared at her, and bared his teeth, and all she could think was how
  stupid she‟d been and how Hot Pie would gloat when they found her half-eaten body the next morning. But the wolf turned and
  raced back into the darkness, and quick as that the eyes were gone""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This got me thinking after watching the reunion in Season 7, then reading this. Can anyone confirm that Nymeria called the wolves off or was with them? Have there been other instances like this that I missed in previous read? I really want to think that Nymeria has been keeping watch over Arya this whole time...</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","167341","<h2>No.</h2>
<p>It's not in the show but in the books, Arya has a couple of warg dreams where she sees through Nymeria's eyes, essentially prowling the forests of what's strongly implied to be the Riverlands.</p>
<p>From <em>A Storm of Swords II: Blood and Gold</em> (Chapter 65, <em>Arya XII</em>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By the time they found themselves in the <strong>foothills of the Mountains of the Moon</strong>, the rains had mostly stopped. Arya could see the sun and moon and stars, and it seemed to her that they were <strong>heading eastwards</strong>. &quot;Where are we going?&quot; she asked again.</p>
<p>This time the Hound answered her. &quot;You have an aunt in the <strong>Eyrie</strong>. Might be she'll want to ransom your scrawny arse, though the gods know why. Once we find the high road, we can follow it all the way to the Bloody Gate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As shown in this quote, by this time Arya and the Hound have left the Riverlands behind and are moving towards the Vale of Arryn. Around that time, Arya has a very vivid dream:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That night she went to sleep thinking of her mother, and wondering if she should kill the Hound in his sleep and rescue Lady Catelyn herself. When she closed her eyes she saw her mother's face against the back of her eyelids. <em>She's so close I could almost smell her</em> ...</p>
<p>... and then she <em>could</em> smell her. The scent was faint beneath the other smells, beneath moss and mud and water, and the stench of rotting reeds and rotting men. She padded slowly through the soft ground to the <strong>river's edge</strong>, lapped up a drink, then lifted her head to sniff. The sky was grey and thick with cloud, <strong>the river</strong> green and full of floating things. Dead men clogged the shallows, some still moving as the water pushed them, others washed up on the banks. Her brothers and sisters swarmed around them, tearing at the ripe flesh.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While not identified by name, the river mentioned there is implied to be the Greenfork (the river at the Twins), way back in the Riverlands.</p>
<p>From <em>A Dance with Dragons II: After the Feast</em> (Chapter 45, <em>The Blind Girl</em>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She opened her eyes and stared up blind at the black that shrouded her, her dream already fading. <em>So beautiful.</em> She licked her lips, remembering. The bleating of the sheep, the terror in the shepherd's eyes, the sounds the dogs made as she killed them one by one, the snarling of her pack. Game had become scarcer since the snows began to fall, but last night they had feasted. Lamb and dog and mutton and the flesh of man. Some of her little grey cousins were afraid of men, even dead men, but not her. Meat was meat, and men were prey. She was the night wolf.</p>
<p>But only when she dreamed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, it's even more obvious. Nymeria is still back in <strong>Westeros</strong> (where winter is settling in) and while the exact region is never identified, she's certainly nowhere near Arya who's in <strong>Braavos</strong> at the time.</p>
<p>There are also several mentions of a giant wolf pack terrorizing the Riverlands.</p>
<p>From <em>A Feast for Crows</em> (Chapter 44, <em>Jaime VII</em>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The next day, Ser Dermot of the Rainwood returned to the castle, empty-handed. When asked what he'd found, he answered, &quot;Wolves. Hundreds of bloody beggars.&quot; He'd lost two sentries to them. The wolves had come out of the dark to savage them. &quot;Armed men in mail and boiled leather, and yet the beasts had no fear of them. Before he died, Jate said the pack was led by a she-wolf of monstrous size. A direwolf, to hear him tell it. [...]</p>
<p>&quot;A ring of fires round your camp might keep them off,&quot; said Jaime, though he wondered. Could Ser Dermot's wolf be the same beast that had mauled Joffrey near the crossroads?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This time the area is clearly identified: Jaime is at Riverrun at the time. Arya, meanwhile, has left Westeros and has spent quite some time already in Braavos.</p>
<p>It seems like Nymeria pretty much remained in the area where Arya left her back in <em>The Game of Thrones</em> and made it her pack's territory. This is also where Arya encounters the pack mentioned in your quote and where she meets Nymeria in season 7.</p>

<p>I wonder what was the Brotherhood doing around Eastwatch and why did they let the Wildling Night's Watch capture them.</p>

<p>The Wildlings probably don't have any idea of Southern Westeros politics so they likely don't know who these guys are. And I don't remember being the job of the Night's Watch to arrest random travellers...</p>

<p>Beric tells us the answer to this one, they were going beyond the Wall because the Great War is coming. Presumably they were going to scout the undead, attack some or for some other purpose. Or their Lord told them to go and help Jon.</p>

<p><em><strong>&quot;Why are these members of the Brotherhood detained at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea?&quot;</strong></em></p>

<p>Lastly, even though the following comment is from Gendry I'm sure Tormund and co probably have the same attitude, they don't trust them. Why would three random people want to go North of the Wall?

<p>As @Skooba points out in a comment below too Tormund saw that same fire god burn Mance so it's likely he doesn't trust them just because of this.</p>

"167392","S07E05: Would this person be the rightful heir to the Targaryen throne when born even if Viserys ascended to the throne before their birth?","<p>In S07E05 of <em>Game of Thrones</em></p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>Gilly finds out that Rhaegar Targaryen secretly married Lyanna Stark, which makes Jon the only surviving legitimate son of Rhaegar Targaryen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since Jon was born <strong>after</strong> Rhaegar Targaryen and the Mad King were killed, at the time of his birth, Viserys Targaryen was the only surviving son of the king, so Viserys was the legitimate heir.</p>

<p>If during the time between the Mad King's death and the birth of Jon, Viserys would have ascended to the Iron Throne, would he continue to stay on the throne once Jon was born? Or, would Jon's birth depose him and make Jon the king?</p>

<p><strong>Clarification:</strong> I think you don't fully understand my meaning in the question. I understand that Jon has priority over Viserys, if they were both alive when Rhaegar was killed. But, Jon wasn't born yet, so during that time Viserys could become the king before Jon was born. If Viserys had ascended to the throne before Jon is born, would that leave Viserys as king until his death and put Viserys' sons (if any exist) before Jon in the line of ascension, or would Jon dethrone Viserys and become king himself upon his birth? (Assuming that everyone is acting lawfully)</p>
","<game-of-thrones><laws>","167394","<h3>Law of inheritance</h3>
<p>The law is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primogeniture#Agnatic_primogeniture"" rel=""noreferrer"">Agnatic Primogeniture</a>, not <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnatic_seniority"" rel=""noreferrer"">Agnatic Seniority</a>.</p>
<p>A Grandson by an elder son comes before a younger son in line of succession for a King.</p>
<p>If the elder son has no sons, the throne then passes to his younger brother.</p>
<p>We don't have anything in Targaryen history where King died and Grandson took the throne (Except when Jaehaerys I died and Viserys I took the throne) but we see that is the westerosi law, Agnatic Primogeniture. Lord Elmo Tully became Lord of Riverlands when his Grandfather died (His father had already died).</p>
<p>It goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Eldest son</li>
<li>Sons of Eldest son in order of their age</li>
<li>Younger son</li>
</ol>
<p>This Agnatic Primogeniture law is the reason why we have a Free Company named Second Sons. Second Sons don't inherit, so they join that mercenary company sometimes to carve their own fortunes. Viserys is a second son, so is Bran. Bran told Ser Rodrik that he will never be Lord of Winterfell because After Eddard that will be Robb and after him, Robb's sons.</p>
<hr />
<h3>What happens once the cup has passed?</h3>
<p>So what happens if Viserys inherits the throne before Jon is born?</p>
<p>Regardless, even if Viserys took the throne, Jon would still be heir of his uncle until a son is born to Viserys. Jon's mere birth wouldn't cause Viserys dethronement but he would be an attractive option for Lords seeking to depose his uncle.</p>
<p>If Viserys becomes King, the succession line shall be determined with regard to him, not his father. So by Agnatic Primogeniture, Jon would still be heir to his uncle as closest male kin. But as soon as a Son is born to Viserys, Jon will go down in line of succession. Since Jon did not exist when his uncle was crowned and anointed Lord of the seven Kingdoms, he can't claim the succession was invalid. Or Perhaps he can, if he wants to press his claim but opponents will point out that since Jon didn't exist back then, the cup has passed and now shall pass to Viserys' brood.</p>
<p>That is however my speculation not canon as there is no such case in canon where an uncle took the throne while a nephew was in womb.</p>
<p>Closest example would be that of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Torgon_Greyiron"" rel=""noreferrer"">Torgon Greyiron the Latecomer</a>. When his father Urragon III died, he was outside of Iron Islands. Iron Islanders choose their Kings via Kingsmoot. His brothers called a Kingsmoot without inviting their eldest brother. The Ironborn elected Urrathon IV Goodbrother as King.</p>
<p>When Torgon returned, he claimed that he wasn't there to make his claim so succession is invalid, as he was the strongest claimant. He successfully deposed Urrathon IV albeit with force of arms.</p>
<p>That's the closest possible example of a claimant appearing once succession is done. But Ironborn are different. Their laws are different. Greenlanders follow bloodlines instead.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Great Council</h3>
<p>This seems like a good case for a fourth <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Great_Council"" rel=""noreferrer"">Great council</a>.</p>
<p>If the succession is unclear, a Great Council is convened at King's Landing where all Lords elect the new heir or King. There have been three Great Councils so far (Only two aimed at electing new Heir/King), which resulted in election of Viserys I and Aegon V.</p>
<p>Now let's assume everyone knew about Lyanna and Rhaegar and that she was pregnant and Lords decide to wait until their child is born (To determine the sex, if its a female, throne passes to Viserys in any case) and convene a council to elect the heir.</p>
<p>From the precedent of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Great_Council#Great_Council_of_233_AC"" rel=""noreferrer"">3rd Great Council</a>, it is clear that Lords prefer to choose elder uncles rather than infant nephews with better claims like they elected King Aegon V instead of his nephew Prince Maegor even though Maegor was son of Aegon's elder brother Aerion.</p>
<p>So in that case, Viserys would win most likely. But trouble here is, Lords feared that Maegor may have inherited his father Prince Aerion's madness, which lead them to turn to his uncles Aemon and Aegon. Viserys was known to be a frightened child, hiding behind his mother's skirts and prone to erratic behavior. Not to mention, Viserys was a minor himself unlike Aemon and Aegon who were adults. So in our case, Viserys is more like Maegor, so Lords might be inclined to choose Jon instead and form a regency council to take care of statecraft until Jon could reach adulthood.</p>
<p>But that will happen only if Viserys hasn't been crowned. If he were crowned, it would be up to him to convene a Grand Council on Jon's birth. If he doesn't, then line shall be established w.r.t him.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Real world closest case</h3>
<p>We have a real world case. That is of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapur_II"" rel=""noreferrer"">Shapur II of Persia</a>. When his father Hormazd II died, he was still in his mother's womb. His elder brother Prince Adur Narseh inherited the throne.</p>
<p>As a result of revolts and conspiracy by nobles against cruelty of the Emperor, Shah Adur Narseh was murdered, his second brother was blinded, third was imprisoned but escaped to Roman Empire. Bereft of any other option, Lords of Persia turned to the unborn Shapur II.</p>
<p>The crown of Persian Empire was placed on his pregnant mother's pudenda as per the tradition and throne was reserved for the unborn child. (That is disputed by some historians given that sex of the child could not be known and if it was a girl, she couldn't take the throne).</p>
<p>The unborn child would go on to rule for seventy years, longest reign of any Persian Emperor and become one of the Greatest Emperors of Persia.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>So why did he choose this target?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","167703","<h1><a href=""https://movies.stackexchange.com/questions/79157/why-did-the-night-king-attack-the-furthest-target-first/79162#79162"">I have posted this answer to Movies.SE, which addresses the same topic.</a></h1>

<hr>

<p>You've pointed at a good flaw. Drogon would have been an equally valid target.</p>

<p>But there are some options here as to why the NK chose Viserion over Drogon.</p>

<h2>1. Drogon is considerably larger.</h2>

<p>Although the ice spear did penetrate Viserion's skin with relative ease, Drogon is a considerably larger and stronger dragon. </p>

<p>We don't know much about the ice spear and whether it has any magical qualities that help with killing dragons. But given that Qyburn's ballista would make for an effective weapon too, I'm going to assume that dragon scales can be penetrated by <strong>brute force</strong> alone, without any magic. The ice spear was thrown with a tremendous amount of force.</p>

<p>But maybe killing Drogon was a stretch. He's a bigger dragon, and looks to be more armored as well. Maybe the Night's King wasn't sure that it'd kill Drogon, and therefore he focused on the smaller, weaker dragons first.</p>

<h2>2. Drogon was on the ground.</h2>

<p>Viserion was hit, couldn't fly anymore, and hit the ice with a considerable impact. When Dany flies away later, you can see that the mark Viserion left on the ice is by far the largest, thus showing that Viserion made a high velocity, high impact landing.</p>

<p>Drogon was on the ground. Even if he were to be hit in the same fashion as Viserion, he wouldn't hit the ground with such an impact, thus not knocking him out or killing him on impact. This may give Drogon (or Danaerys) the time to deal with the spear.<br>
Viserion did lose a lot of blood very quickly; but Drogon is comparatively larger and more armored, would bleed less, and is maybe able to shrug it off more easily (similar to why stabbing a dog-sized animal with a dagger will kill it, but stabbing an elephant-sized animal will only wound it)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>edit</strong><br>
  There is another thing to consider here. The spear hit Viserion <strong>under the wing</strong>. I'm not sure how much of a marksman the Night's King is, but he hit Viserion in a place that would prevent him from flying, which is exactly how he should have taken Viserion down. It's also likely that the dragons are less armored near their wings, because armoring would chafe them during flying. They need a fair range of movement with their wings.  </p>
  
  <p>This is pure speculation, but if we assume that the Night's King was aiming for a weak spot near the base of the wing, Drogon would not be a viable target as he was using his wings to rest on the ground, and therefore covering it. The weak spot would not be visible/hittable by the Night's King.<br>
  Even if he could pierce Drogon's wing to hit the weak spot anyway, he had no line of sight to the weak spot and would be guesstimating his throw. Since this theory assumes that the Night's King was aiming precisely, that makes Drogon a difficult target to accurately hit (exactly on the weak spot).<br>
  Comparatively, the flying dragons were better targets, as their weak spots are more exposed to those below them.</p>
  
  <p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/zWPxZ.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">Looking at the linked image in GhotiandChips' answer</a>, from the Night's King's perspective, most of what he could hit on Drogon seems to either be pretty well armored, or invisible due to the wing covering line of sight to it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>3. Drogon couldn't escape right away.</h2>

<p>It should have been clear to the Night's King that Drogon was the transport dragon, carrying Dany and soon also the others. This slows Drogon down. He is also not able to just up and leave, because he can't leave Dany or the others, who will be quickly overwhelmed by the wights.</p>

<p>The Night's King wasn't trying to kill one dragon, he was trying to kill <strong>multiple</strong> dragons. He obviously did not stop at killing one. Though we didn't see him throw a third spear, nor target Rhaegal specifically, it seems fair to assume that he was trying to kill all the dragons.</p>

<p><strong>If he kills Drogon first</strong>, Rhaegal and Viserion can immediately fly away. They are already in the air, mobile, and they don't have to take people along with them.<br>
<strong>If he kills a flying dragon first</strong>, Drogon can't just fly away. Not only will it take him more time to leave (due to not flying already), he also needs to load people, and presumably fly more safely so that the people do not fall off (evidenced by Jorah almost falling off when Drogon dodged the spear).</p>

<p>If you're trying to kill as much as you can, start by killing those who can run away to safety quickly, and kill the slow ones later.</p>

<h2>4. Unknown and out of universe reasons</h2>

<ul>
<li>Viserion was the weakest dragon, mentally and physically. Maybe that's why Viserion was targeted. Maybe dragons can resist the resurrection of the white walkers (or retain their identity), but Viserion is notably weak (as was Vyserys, who the dragon is named after). But this is pure speculation of course.</li>
<li><strong>It's a story</strong>. It wouldn't make narrative sense to kill the representative dragon first. Drogon is shown considerably more often than the others, because he is the representative of the dragons. This is similar to Thormund. We haven't seen any wildlings (excuse me, <strong>Free Folk</strong>) lately. Whenever the wildl... Free Folk have been part of the story, they have been represented by Thormund. Other representatives are Grey Worm (for the Unsullied), Daario (for the Second Sons), Yohn Royce (for the knights of the Vale), Jaqen (for the Faceless Men, who really should be represented by many faces to prove a point), ...</li>
<li>It's classic exposition. When a villain introduces his doomsday weapon, he will usually showcase its ability on a random test subject. This is done to <strong>prove to the viewer</strong> that the weapon is real and deadly. I could point to another example from Rick and Morty. There is a scene where Rick is sad, but is not speaking (it's just music playing). He takes out a device, and a little creature, and kills the creature with the device. He then puts the device on his own head, clearly intending to kill himself. <strong>If the viewer did not see the first creature die, they would not understand that this is a suicide attempt</strong> (e.g. maybe it's a device to clear headaches). The same is true here. Viserion's death proves to the viewer that <strong>dragons can be killed by White Walkers</strong>. Up until now, that was never proven. It's possible that viewers thought that the dragons are the be all end all solution to White Walkers, but this scene proves that they are still risking their lives by fighting the White Walkers.</li>

<p>It seems like the entire situation could have been resolved by just having a few archers in the army. Surely in all the thousands that were killed and turned by the Night King, some were archers? Moreover archers are a staple of any army.</p>

<p>In the show, Jon <strike>Snow</strike> Targaryen is shown to be dark haired, while all other Targaryens are blonde-almost white.</p>

<p>We have seen that the colour of the hair is deemed a good indication as to which family one could belong to (see the ""Baratheon"" children).</p>

<p>Is there a good explanation of why Jon does not fit the Targaryen pattern? Or should it be considered ""hand-wave"" away-able because ""no other Targaryen-Stark child was ever born so it is not a given that he should have Targaryen hair""?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><jon-snow>","167656","<h3>Historical Half Targaryens with Non-Valyrian features</h3>
<p>That's the case with many Half Targaryens in history.</p>
<p>King Daeron II married Mariah Martell. His first born son, Prince Baelor had dark hair of his mother.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of Prince Maekar he saw no sign, but he recognized Prince Baelor at
Lord Ashford's side. Sunlight flashed golden off the shoulder clasp
that held his cloak and the slim coronet about his temples, but
otherwise he dressed far more simply than most of the other lords.
<strong>He does not look a Targaryen in truth, with that dark hair</strong>. Dunk said as much to Egg.</p>
<p>&quot;It's said <strong>he favors his mother</strong>,&quot; the boy reminded him. &quot;<strong>She was
a Dornish princess.</strong>&quot;<br><sub><strong>Dunk and Egg: The Hedge Knight</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prince Baelor's own sons Valarr and Matarys had the same hair.</p>
<p>King Daeron's fourth son, Maekar had Targaryen silver hair. But he married a Dayne. So his first born son, Prince Daeron also had the common hair instead of the silver-gold hair of Targaryens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dunk chewed, swallowed, and tore off some more bread. &quot;Why did you do
it? Was it some jape, to make a fool of the stupid hedge knight?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No.&quot; The boy's eyes filled with tears, but he stood there manfully.
&quot;I was supposed to squire for Daeron. He's my oldest brother. I
learned everything I had to learn to be a good squire, but Daeron
isn't a very good knight. He didn't want to ride in the tourney, so
after we left Summerhall he stole away from our escort, only instead
of doubling back he went straight on toward Ashford, thinking they'd
never look for us that way. It was him shaved my head. He knew my
father would send men hunting us. <strong>Daeron has common hair, sort of a
pale brown, nothing special, but mine is like Aerion's and my
father's</strong>.&quot;<br><sub><strong>Dunk and Egg: The Hedge Knight</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, Ser Harwin Strong fathered three bastard sons on Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen , all of them inherited their real father's brown hair (But supposedly their legal father was Laenor Velaryon, who didn't care about getting cuckolded).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whatever the truth of these tales, it was soon announced that the
princess was with child. Born in the waning days of 114 AC, <strong>the boy
was a large, strapping lad, with brown hair, brown eyes, and a pug
nose</strong> (Ser Laenor had the aquiline nose, silver-white hair, and
purple eyes that bespoke his Valyrian blood). Laenor’s wish to name
the child Joffrey was overruled by his father, Lord Corlys. Instead
the child was given a traditional Velaryon name: Jacaerys (friends and
brothers would call him Jace).<br><sub><strong>The Rogue Prince</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Princess Rhaenyra had given birth to a second son</strong> late in the year 115 AC. The child was named Lucerys (Luke for short). Septon Eustace
tells us that both Ser Laenor and Ser Harwin were at Rhaenyra’s
bedside for his birth. <strong>Like his brother Jace, Luke had brown eyes
and a healthy head of brown hair</strong>, rather than the silver-gilt hair
of Targaryen princelings<br><sub><strong>The Rogue Prince</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 117 AC, on Dragonstone, Princess Rhaenyra bore yet another son. Ser
Laenor was at last permitted to name a child after his fallen friend,
Ser Joffrey Lonmouth. <strong>Joffrey Velaryon was as big and red-faced and
healthy as his brothers, but like them he had brown hair, brown eyes,
and features that some at court called common</strong>. The whispering began
again. Amongst the greens, it was an article of faith that the father
of Rhaenyra’s sons was not her husband Laenor, but her champion,
Harwin Strong.<br><sub><strong>The Rogue Prince</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other than that, King Aegon IV sired a ripe crop of bastards. Three of them were sired on a black courtesan, named Bellenora, Narha and Balerion. Their description is not given but since Bellenora came to be known as the Black Pearl of Bravos, I suppose she was black as were her siblings. He also had Aegor Rivers, better known as Bittersteel, the founder of Golden Company, with Lady Barba Bracken. The lad had purple eyes from his father but inherited black hair of his mother.</p>
<p>King Aegon V married Betha Blackwood. His eldest son was a ravenhead. His physical description is not given but his illustration in TWOIAF shows that he inherited raven locks of his mother, unlike his brothers and sisters.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rYP9d.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rYP9d.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>And most Recently, Prince Rhaegar's children with Elia Martell are good example. Rhaenys took after her mother and inherited her dark hair but Aegon took after his father. So among all three of Rhaegar's children, only Aegon took after him while Rhaenys and Jon took after their mothers.</p>
<h3>Historical Half Targaryens with Valyrian features</h3>
<p>While it can happen (Half-Targaryens taking after non-Targaryen parent), as we see evidence above, it is not something which always happens.</p>
<p>King Aegon V married Betha Blackwood, all of their children were your typical Targaryens except the eldest Prince Duncan the Small, Prince of Dragonflies (See above).</p>
<p>King Daeron II's all children were Typical Targaryens except Baelor Breakspear.</p>
<p>King Maekar's all children were typical Targaryen except Daeron Targaryen.</p>
<p>Princess Rhaenyra's mother was an Arryn (although Lady Aemma Arryn herself was a half Targaryen and cousin to her husband), but she was typical Targaryen. Rhaenra's half siblings Aegon II, Aemond, Daeron and Helaena were all typical Targaryens as well despite having a Hightower (Although Alicent Hightower's hair color is not mentioned) for their mother.</p>
<h3>Case of Jon and Arya</h3>
<p>So it shouldn't be surprising that when Rhaegar (Silver Gold hair) married Lyanna (Brown hair), their child was born with Brown hair as Silver-Gold is a recessive gene, while Brown is dominant.</p>
<p>Jon had the brown hair of Starks, which he inherited from his mother. Arya inherited the same from her father.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would have been easier if Arya had been a bastard, like their half
brother Jon. She even looked like Jon, with the long face and brown hair of
the Starks, and nothing of their lady mother in her face or her
coloring. <br><sub><strong>AGOT: Sansa I</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They both also had the Grey eyes of Starks. While everyone wondered who was Jon's mother who left nothing of her in him, It was actually his father who left nothing of him in Jon.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In any case, Jon had a good enough chance of getting Targaryen outlook but his mother's genes won and he was born lucky, looking like a Stark, making it feasible for Eddard to lie. Otherwise explaining a Valyrian looking bastard would have been really hard. Would have gone something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Robert: Say Eddard, how did you sire a Valyrian looking bastard?</p>
<p>Ned: I went to Lys.</p>
<p>Robert: When? You never had the time to go to Lys.</p>
<p>Ned: Okay you got me. I had an affair with Queen Rhaella.</p>
<p>Robert: Rhaella? Hmm I don't see the timeline match but she was with
child when she fled. But her Child was Daenerys Stormborn.</p>
<p>Ned: She's my daughter too. Jon's twin.</p>
<p>Robert: GODDAMMIT NED! TELL THE TRUTH!</p>

"167661","Was the rescue in Episode 6 ""Beyond the Wall"" achieved in a plausible time?","<p>In Episode 6 of Season 7 of <em>Game of Thrones</em> (""Beyond the Wall"") Jon and the group that went beyond the Wall to bring back a wight to King's Landing find themselves surrounded by the Army of the Dead. Just before this happens, Jon asks Gendry to travel to the Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and send ravens to Dany in Dragonstone to help them out beyond the Wall.</p>

<p>Even if the TV show is running the time a bit faster episode-wise it would still take a bit of time for:</p>

<ol>
<li>Gendry to travel back to the Wall.</li>
<li>A raven to get from the Wall to Dragonstone.</li>
<li>Dany riding off to beyond the Wall to help Jon and company.</li>
</ol>

<p>Given there's a lot of geographical distance at play here, how much time passed between Gendry splitting from the group and Dany getting to them?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","167668","<p>A <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/mikeCFNI"" rel=""noreferrer"">user on reddit</a> did some calculations claiming it was accurate. The user estimated it to be around 5 days based on growth rate of ice, the air speed of an <s>unladen swallow</s> raven, and approximation for distances and dragon speed.</p>

<p><sub><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/comments/6uzztg/s7e6_gendry_and_the_ravens_isnt_teleportation/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Link to the original post</a></sub></p>

<p>I've broken down their answer but provided a link to the original just above.</p>

<ul>
<li>Gendry's run, around 4 hours: 

<ul>
<li>The Seven (/Twelve with the additional rangers) likely weren't travelling in a line straight north. They were searching for the Army of the dead, and specifically a lone wight or, as they ended up finding, a small party of wights. This means they would likely be travelling in a zig-zag type of walk to cover as much area as possible. Furthermore sticking to higher altitude so they would have that over their opponents (As they end up looking down at the wights in the canyon).</li>
<li>Gendry running at full speed would require about 4 hours to cover a significant amount of ground. We can't be sure how many days the Seven had been travelling for, but if we assume it to be about 2 days of zigzagging over quite a large area it would be a reasonable assumption for it to take Gendry about 4 hours to run back.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Raven likely took around 3 days to get from Eastwatch to Dragonstone.

<ul>
<li>A raven flying from Eastwatch to Winterfell would be about a day:<br>
Homing pigeons have been recorded to be able to reach speeds of up to 50mph and although <a href=""http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/91120-how-far-can-ravens-fly-in-a-day/"" rel=""noreferrer"">discussions have taken place</a> to the speed of ravens, although no real speed is given, we are led to believe that in-universe ravens are quicker and stronger that in-universe pigeons as stated by Maester Aemon:  

<blockquote>
  <p>Doves and pigeons can also be trained to carry messages,” the maester [Aemon] went on, “though the raven is a stronger flyer, larger, bolder, far more clever, better able to defend itself against hawks ...  </p>
</blockquote></li>
<li>Continuing this idea to flying to Dragonstone. It's about the same distance from Winterfell to Kings Landing as it is to Dragonstone. The show claims it to be about 1000 miles from Winterfell to King's Landing (according to the user). This gives us about 3 days of raven flight if we take the 500 mile per day cap set by the users in the discussion above.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Dany and her dragons likely took around 8 or so hours to fly to ""Snow team 6""

<ul>
<li>The user approximated around 125mph for a Dragon with a rider. Given the size of the Dragons, this seem possible as a normal hawk is able to fly around 70mph. Whether wingspan changes speed is unclear but big birds tend to be quicker than small birds.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>This gives us about 5 days of total travel from Gendry running to the Dragons arriving.</p>

<p>The ice aspect is a bit strange. As 10˚F is around -12˚C and doesn't seem that cold for Gendry to be crying about the freezing cold weather. It was likely closer to -30˚C to -40˚C which I guess would make the ice freeze twice as quick. But bearing in mind that the Ice was thin in the first place there might be something that was preventing the water from garnering thickness very quickly. Such as the hot springs which exist naturally in the north (Winterfell's walls, Ygritte and Jon's cave) may have slowed the freezing of the water.</p>

<hr>

<h3>There are theories it can be done in ~3 days.</h3>

<p>If we take the 500 miles per day, and the fact that white Ravens can fly from Old Town to Winterfell, it's possible a Raven can fly to Dragonstone from Eastwatch directly. This would cut down travel time to about 2 days of raven flight (at 50mph with rest). If we take a Dragons airspeed to be around 200mph it would do the return flight in 5 hours. Easily done in ~three days, allowing for better calculation for the rate of freezing of the water.</p>

"167684","Why did the army of the dead wait?","<p>So, after watching the show last night-something really didn't make sense to me. The army surrounds the group, then it waits, and keeps waiting, until it finds out the lake is re-frozen(We know post-scene that the dead can survive underwater). Then it charges with minimal forces against a small group? Was this the real reason-or was it actually waiting for something else?</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> As in the dragons. After all, it was nothing for the Night King to take down a dragon with a karate chop. If so-how would he know they'd be coming?</p>
</blockquote>
","<game-of-thrones>","167704","<p>The Night King and his army's motives are fairly mysterious. But we do know he knows when he is being watched by Bran, and seems to possess some magical abilities.</p>

<p>For instance, the Night King, (probably) in the past, marked Bran when he was checking out their army, negating the wards against them on the Three-Eyed-Raven's Cave. </p>

<p>Being able to know when he is being watched by a warg, and being able to mark Bran makes me believe that he has some sort of abilities related or akin to greenseeing. And greenseeing can take different forms. Jojen for instance, could glimpse the future.</p>

<p>So the obvious answer is that the dead were simply waiting things out, <strong>until the lake was frozen enough for them to cross and kill them. And they didn't send the whole hoard over all at once to make sure the ice would hold.</strong></p>

<p>But the less obvious answer is this: <strong>the Nightking may know he needs an undead dragon to defeat man, and he may have been waiting to face a dragon that his side could kill. The Nightking might not know the particulars, but he could have an idea of possible futures. This isn't something we know, but it is possible.</strong></p>

<p><strong>You also ask about long-range weaponry. It's true, one of the White Walkers could have launched a spear at them, but we don't know how many spears they have, what it takes to make them and if they are a limited resource.</strong> Since these spears appear to the magical in nature (as in they shatter most steel) it might not be worthwhile to them.  Common wights are cheap. I don't think their special weapons are.</p>

<p><strong>Also, the White Walkers will be wanting the bodies of the heroes to rez as wights.</strong> There's no point in killing them until you can get them, and you can get them with a minimum amount of resource expenditure just by standing there.If you do kill one or two, the others might just burn the body before you can get to them, and that means you wouldn't get the bodies to make wights. In the books, wights seem to retain some semblance of knowledge and skills that they had in life. If I were the White Walkers, the fighting prowess of these guys would make it worth the wait so I could convert them.</p>

<p>In any case, their perception of time is not the same as ours. It's been thousands of years since the last attack, and they can afford to be patient. </p>

<hr />
<p>I think that the basic premise of your question is based on assumptions that don't have many facts that support them. Even if on a first impression one could be lead to think so, <strong>there is no evidence that both &quot;Three-Eyed Crow&quot; and &quot;Greenseer&quot; are titles or positions to be held</strong>, that are passed form one person to another, in the same fashion of nobiliar titles, religious hierarchy or other titles granted to leaders (like, in example,  the King of the North, the High Septon, the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, and so on).</p>
<h1>About Greenseers.</h1>
<p>We can gather informations about Greenseers mainly from Bran's chapters of the novels:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;They were a people dark and beautiful, small of stature, no taller than children even when grown to manhood. They lived in the depths of the wood, in caves and crannogs and secret tree towns. Slight as they were, the children were quick and graceful. Male and female hunted together, with weirwood bows and flying snares. Their gods were the gods of the forest, stream, and stone, the old gods whose names are secret. <strong>Their wise men were called greenseers, and carved strange faces in the weirwoods to keep watch on the woods.</strong> How long the children reigned here or where they came from, no man can know.<br />
<sub><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Game_of_Thrones-Chapter_66"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A Game of Thrones - Bran VII</a></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Then you teach me.&quot; Bran still feared the three-eyed crow who haunted his dreams sometimes, pecking endlessly at the skin between his eyes and telling him to fly. &quot;You're a greenseer.&quot;<br />
&quot;No,&quot; said Jojen, &quot;only a boy who dreams. <strong>The greenseers were more than that. They were wargs as well, as you are, and the greatest of them could wear the skins of any beast that flies or swims or crawls, and could look through the eyes of the weirwoods as well, and see the truth that lies beneath the world.</strong><br />
<sub><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Storm_of_Swords-Chapter_9"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A Storm of Swords - Bran I</a></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;Only one man in a thousand is born a skinchanger,&quot;</strong> Lord Brynden said one day, after Bran had learned to fly, <strong>&quot;and only one skinchanger in a thousand can be a greenseer.&quot;</strong><br />
&quot;I thought the greenseers were the wizards of the children,&quot; Bran said. &quot;The singers, I mean.&quot;<br />
&quot;In a sense. Those you call the children of the forest have eyes as golden as the sun, but <strong>once in a great while one is born amongst them with eyes as red as blood, or green as the moss on a tree in the heart of the forest. By these signs do the gods mark those they have chosen to receive the gift.</strong> The chosen ones are not robust, and their quick years upon the earth are few, for every song must have its balance. But once inside the wood they linger long indeed. A thousand eyes, a hundred skins, wisdom deep as the roots of ancient trees. <strong>Greenseers.</strong>&quot;<br />
<sub><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Dance_with_Dragons-Chapter_34"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A Dance with Dragons - Bran III</a></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the text, we know that Greenseers were exceptional individuals, in the sense that they were born with abilities that nobody else had, and because of this they seem to have been chosen as the leaders of their people. So, in a way, Greenseer was just an attribute given to a particularly blessed individual,  pretty much like in the real world we could call &quot;genius&quot; someone like Albert Einstein.<br />
It also had the connotation of a position of leadership, but it seems that they acquired this thanks to their abilities, and <strong>there is no proof that only one Greenseer lived at a certain time (the texts seem to imply the other way around), or that there was something like a supreme leader like a organized religion could have</strong>. They seem to be more like druids and tribal shamans rather than a formal hierarchy of priests.<br />
Going on with the example above, we can see that real geniuses are not common even in our world, but we don't have a genius &quot;position&quot; that is filled when the previous one dies; and of course both Einstein and Turing were without a doubt geniuses, and they lived during the same timeframe; I think that we can safely speculate that with Greenseers it was something like that.</p>
<h1>About the Three-eyed Crow. And Brynden Rivers too.</h1>
<p>We know that Bran <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/14567/83101"">sees a Three-eyed Crow in his dreams</a>; there is not much reason to quote every occurrence, it is well established without the need to provide references. It is more interesting to note that even Jojen Reed saw it in one of his green dreams:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jojen's eyes were the color of moss, and sometimes when he looked at you he seemed to be seeing something else. Like now. &quot;<strong>I dreamed of a winged wolf bound to earth with grey stone chains</strong>,&quot; he said. &quot;It was a green dream, so I knew it was true. <strong>A crow was trying to peck through the chains</strong>, but the stone was too hard and his beak could only chip at them.&quot;<br />
<strong>&quot;Did the crow have three eyes?&quot;<br />
Jojen nodded.</strong><br />
<sub><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Clash_of_Kings-Chapter_28"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">A Clash of Kings - Bran IV</a></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can see here that these green dreams are made by metaphorical images that have to be correctly interpreted. <strong>Bran never thinks about himself as a Winged Wolf, it is just how Jojen sees him in his dreams; a similar thing could be said for the Three-eyed Crow, it is supposed to be just the dream image of someone else, even if we, like Bran, initially don't know who he could possibly be.</strong> (also check <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/63671/83101"">this question</a>).<br />
Other characters that don't experience green dreams, very likely speak of it just because he listened to him telling his dreams, there is not a single piece of evidence that they have previous knowledge about a Three-Eyed Crow.</p>
<p>When Bran &amp; company arrive at the cave, they met a cadaverous man trapped inside a tree; we know that even if it is not explicitly stated, he is Brynden &quot;Bloodraven&quot; Rivers, I won't go into detail here; just like Jojen was able to tell that his Winged Wolf was Bran when he saw him, Bran was able to recognize his Three-eyed Crow; <strong>it is interesting to note that Bloodraven seems surprised to be called like that</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;Are you the three-eyed crow?&quot;</strong> Bran heard himself say. A three-eyed crow should have three eyes. He has only one, and that one red. Bran could feel the eye staring at him, shining like a pool of blood in the torchlight. Where his other eye should have been, a thin white root grew from an empty socket, down his cheek, and into his neck.<br />
<strong>&quot;A … crow?&quot;</strong> The pale lord's voice was dry. His lips moved slowly, as if they had forgotten how to form words. <strong>&quot;Once, aye. Black of garb and black of blood.&quot;</strong> The clothes he wore were rotten and faded, spotted with moss and eaten through with worms, but once they had been black. &quot;I have been many things, Bran. Now I am as you see me, and now you will understand why I could not come to you … except in dreams. I have watched you for a long time, watched you with a thousand eyes and one. I saw your birth, and that of your lord father before you. I saw your first step, heard your first word, was part of your first dream. I was watching when you fell. And now you are come to me at last, Brandon Stark, though the hour is late.&quot;<br />

</blockquote>
<p>We know that in ASOIAF, dreams and prophecies are never explicit, they are always in the form of images that have to be interpreted; Bran was seen by Jojen as a Winged Wolf because of his House's heraldic emblem, it was a symbolic representation of his identity; pretty much in the same way, Bloodraven was symbolized in the green dreams by a crow, both because of his nickname (derived by the shape and color of his birthmark) and by his past as a member of the Night's Watch (they are called &quot;crows&quot;).<br />
As I have pointed out, <strong>he seems to be surprised to be called like that (he was seen by others in green dreams, but presumably he wasn't present in his own dreams in a symbolic form), and when he answers, he seem to acknowledge more his past as a member of the Night Watch  (&quot;Black of Garb&quot;) rather than the form he took in other's dreams.</strong></p>
<p>As things stands right now, we don't know much about Bloodraven acts and motivations in the Night Watch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ser Brynden Rivers set sail for the Wall late in the year of 233 AC. (No one intercepted his ship). Two hundred men went with him, many of them archers from Bloodraven's personal guard, the Raven's Teeth. The king's brother, Maester Aemon, was also amongst them.<br />
Bloodraven would rise to become Lord Commander of the Night's Watch in 239 AC, serving until his disappearance during a ranging beyond the Wall in 252 AC.<br />

<hr />
<h1>Summarizing</h1>
<p>We know that a very small fraction of the Children of the Forest possessed exceptional powers, and that those individuals were called Greenseers; this name was more of an &quot;attribute&quot;, a &quot;quality&quot;, rather than a formal title or a position to be held. This is further supported by the fact that we also know two examples of humans born with this ability, Bloodraven and Bran Stark: surely they weren't leaders of the Children of the Forest. They were Greenseers too, because of their abilities, not because they were elected, invested, or because somebody else left that &quot;position&quot; vacant; and  You basically are born as a Greenseer, you don't become it.</p>
<p>In a similar way, the Three-eyed Crow was just a symbolic image of a specific person in some other people's green dreams, when directly called like that, Boodraven did not immediately seem to understand; even here, this is the only evidence that we can collect form the text, it is not stated anywhere that this could be a title, a position to be held, or anything like that. <strong>Certainly, nowhere in the books Bran was called Three-eyed Crow, not by Bloodraven handing down the &quot;position&quot; to him, nor by anybody else; he was just being acknowledged as possessing the powers of &quot;a&quot; Greenseer (not &quot;the&quot; Greenseer)</strong>.</p>
<p>We don't even know if there was someone that &quot;called&quot; Bloodraven at the cave in the same fashion as he &quot;called&quot; Bran, or if he went there by his own free will (he was reputed to be a sorceror and a man of great knowledge after all), or even if he arrived there by chance.<br />
Similarly we don't even know if what he is doing here is because he is fulfilling someone else's duty, if he is acting on is own initiative, or in the end why he is here at all, besides teaching Bran to realize himself (we see anything only from the point of view of the little Stark after all).</p>
<p>So, to answer your question:</p>
<p><strong>Literally speaking, we only know that the Three-eyed Crow was a dream image symbolizing Bloodraven, tied to his nickname and birthmark and to his past as a Brother of the Night's Watch. It is highly unlikely that somebody else could be depicted in this way, even Bran was seen as a Winged Wolf. In a way, it was just a nickname like &quot;The Hound&quot; for Sandor Clegane or &quot;The Blackfish&quot; for Brynden Tully.<br />
If we want to use the Three-eyed Crow in a figurative way to describe what Bloodraven is doing, there is no evidence whatsoever that there was really somone before him doing what he is doing now; the assumption that this could be a position that is handed down from an individual to another is just that, an assumption that is not confirmed (or denied, for that matter) anywhere in the books.</strong></p>

"31339","Which last name should the children of Robert and Cersei pass to their children","<p>For example with King Joffrey, he is (I know, I know he really isn't) the descendant of Houses Baratheon and Lannister, so because of that which last name is he passing to his children?</p>

<p>In my country we have two last names, the one of the father and the one of the mother. So my name is <strong>Name last1 last2</strong> and I only pass my first last name to my children, so for example my wife's name is <strong>Mom_Name Mom_last1 Mom_last2</strong> and my children they all will have <strong>Child_Name last1 Mom_last1</strong>, so only the <em>House</em> of the father is passing through time.</p>

<p>Maybe it is different in your countries, that's why I wanted to explain that.</p>

<p>I understand if the last name they pass may be the one with more importance, but it should be a rule, because if not the great name of <em>House Lannister</em> could be lost (Jaime can't have children and Tyrion is not welcome in the family).</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><game-of-thrones>","31342","<p>In the US and much (but not all) of Western Europe, the father's family name is passed on to the children.  This is a tradition going back centuries and is (at least where I live) the ""expected"" thing to do.</p>

<p>So, just as Robb Stark is not a Tully (his mother's family name) Joffrey should legally be a Baratheon, not a Lannister.</p>

<p>In terms of inheritance, Jaime should be first in line, followed by Tyrion.  I'm not sure where Cersei stands, since I don't know whether women can inherit.  If she can't, I would expect the lands/money/what have you to pass to her children <em>even though they are not Lannisters</em> since they are descended from them.  Just as the Iron throne went to Joffrey rather than Stannis or Renly, offspring seem to take precedence over siblings in this political system.</p>

<p>And (ADWD spoilers)</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>- Jon Connington<br>

<p>Also to be included in the list is of course Howland Reed's children, Jojen and Meera. They did in fact come close to the topic of Rhaegar and Lyanna when they told Bran of the story of the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Knight_of_the_Laughing_Tree"">Knight of the Laughing Tree</a>. So close, in fact, that I half expected they were about to reveal something to Bran.</p>

<p>However, there is another option, stemming from the prophecy that Daenerys got in the House of the Undying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Her silver was trotting through the grass, to a darkling stream beneath a sea of stars. A corpse stood at the prow of a ship, eyes bright on his dead face, gray lips smiling sadly. <em>A blue flower grew from a chink in a wall of ice, and filled the air with sweetness...mother of dragons...bride of death..</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The blue rose is no doubt a reference to Lyanna, as she was notably fond of such. The wall of ice is of course The Wall. And the context in which this is mentioned is ""bride of death"", where the first mentioned ""husband"" is presumably Drogo and the second presumably Victarion. It is fairly reasonable to assume that the third one refers to Jon, since he is presumably Rhaegar and Lyanna's son, and a Targaryen by blood (viable husband), at the Wall, and as of ADWD also (spoiler)</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>dead (bride of death)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, while it is not clear exactly how it will happen, it seems this prophecy indicates that Daenerys will meet Jon at the Wall and his parentage will be revealed somehow. All this is, of course, pure guesswork.</p>

<p>There is also the option which will be completely covered by spoiler tags, since it mainly takes place in ADWD:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>Bran is now a greenseer and an apprentice of Bloodraven. He has already seen Ned Stark with (presumably) Jon and Robb, praying before the heart tree <em>""Let them grow up as brothers""</em>. I think it is probably very likely that Bran will look deeper into history there and find out the truth about Jon.<p>
Bloodraven himself will also have a lot of knowledge about house Stark, as he has been watching them for years. And it is not unlikely that he will have paid close attention to the events surrounding Rhaegar and Lyanna.<p>
Also, it is likely (or perhaps only possible) that Coldhands is in fact Benjen Stark, who might have knowledge of Jon's parentage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it is interesting to note, however, that (ADWD spoiler)</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>...GRRM drops quite a few hints that Jon is actually the son of Ned Stark and a fisherman's daughter. Firstly, it is mentioned in a Davos chapter by the Lord of Sisterton regarding Ned Stark and a fisherman's daughter that ""he left her with a bastard in her belly and a bag of silver"" (paraphrasing). Secondly, Stannis says <em>""You haggle like a crone with a codfish, Lord Snow. Did Ned Stark father you on some fishwife?""</em> And Jon himself thinks something like <em>""Perhaps he did, at that""</em><p>
Although a possibility, I am more inclined to think this is a red herring, however.</p>

<p>It also appears that Dany has an attraction towards Jon as she waits for him on the wall, looks worried at the state he's in and sits by his bedside with him among other things.</p>

<hr>

<p>The answer provides evidence that the lake on which the scene takes places seems to have old structures there. This would indicate a previous settlement, most likely by the Night's Watch during the construction of the Wall. Iron forging is only known south of the wall, and therefore makes it unlikely to be a Free Folk settlement. The purpose of this settlement was possibly to be an ice farm during the construction of the wall. <strong>If chains were used (and subsequently abandoned) this gives us one option for the Army of the Dead to obtain the chains.</strong> </p>

<hr>

<p>A second option is that the chains came from <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Hardhome"" rel=""noreferrer"">Hardhome</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hardhome sits on a sheltered bay and has natural harbour deep enough for the biggest ships afloat. Wood and stone are plentiful near there. The waters teem with fish, and there are colonies of seals and sea cows close at hand. A great cliff looms above the settlement, pocked with cave mouths.</p>
  
  <p>Hardhome was close to becoming the only true town north of the Wall.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If Hardhome was supporting trade and large ship, it is likely they would have chains at the docks for anchors, cargo loading, or other maritime activities. <strong>Since the Army of the Dead has recently sacked that settlement, they may have also found chains there.</strong> </p>

<p>One method I generally discount is that the chain was made from ice. While it is known the White Walkers have certain ice magic to create their swords and spears, these weapons are rough looking  and blueish in color. The chain does not share these qualities. </p>

<hr>

<p>Now how they got the chains on... I think it is as simple as the dead cannot swim properly and sink. However, since they are dead already they can still move. Basically the same as what the crew of the Black Pearl did in <em>Pirates of Caribbean</em>.  </p>

"167770","Why does Tyrion think a successor is so important at this point in Season 7, episode 6?","<p>In the episode Beyond the Wall, Dany and Tyrion had a lengthly conversation about successors. And Tyrion said to Dany:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You say you can't have children.</p>
  
  <p>But there are other ways of choosing a successor.</p>
  
  <p>The Night's Watch has one method, The Iron born folk, although many
  flaws have another.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why did he think it was so important to remind Dany of this now?
What are the methods he is talking about exactly besides having children?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","167772","<p>The two examples Tyrion cites:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Nights Watch - They choose by popular vote on those who wants to be the next leader.</li>
<li>The Ironborne - (not 100% on this) They choose via a Moot on those who want to be a leader.</li>
</ul>

<p>Essentially Tyrion is saying you can't have children but you could either pick a successor or let the people decide.</p>

<p>As to why he thinks it's important, he explains that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your Grace, I saw hundreds of arrows fly towards you when you fought on Blackwater Rush, and I saw hundred of arrows miss. But any one of them could have found your heart.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Essentially if you keep flying into danger at some point danger will come your way. Without a successor in place this whole thing will have been for nothing.</p>

<p>As @MikeScott mentions in a comment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He may also be trying to suggest to Dany that it's irresponsible of her to put herself in danger, since in fact there is no potential successor who can control her dragons (as far as anyone knows at this point), regardless of how they are chosen. And without the dragons, the whole enterprise will immediately collapse.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tyrion never outright states it but it is certainly implied though I don't think it is his main reason for bringing it up.</p>

<p>As @Kepotx says in a comment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also, if she win, but die without successor, that mean no queen, and new war for the throne. This fact is not in her favour if she want to bring lot of people on her side.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If she is to gain more support having an available successor will help. However, it doesn't seem to be common knowledge that Dany can't have children, and it's even debatable if she can or not, so this might not be the main motive behind Tyrion's comment.</p>

<h3>Who used Water Magic and What was it?</h3>
<p>Well first of all, Water Magic was used by the Rhoynar people historically.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Art and music flourished in the cities of the Rhoyne, and <strong>it is said
their people had their own magic—a water magic very different from the
sorceries of Valyria, which were woven of blood and fire</strong>. Though
united by blood and culture and the river that had given them birth,
the Rhoynish cities were elsewise fiercely independent, each with its
own prince...or princess, for amongst these river folk, women were
regarded as the equals of men.<br><sub>TWOIAF - Ancient History: 10,000 Ships</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was said that Rhoynar could get intel from Mother Rhoyne about threats and raise Watery Walls to protect their cities:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was said the <strong>Mother Rhoyne herself whispered to her children of
every threat</strong>, that the <strong>Rhoynar princes wielded strange</strong>, uncanny
powers, that Rhoynish women fought as fiercely as Rhoynish men, and
<strong>that their cities were protected by &quot;watery walls&quot; that would rise to drown any foe</strong>.<br><sub>TWOIAF - Ancient History: 10,000 Ships</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>First Turtle War</h3>
<p>It was the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/First_Turtle_War"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">First Turtle War</a> between Rhoynar and Valyrian Freehold in which Rhoynar made first known use of their magic and flooded Valyrian city of Volon Therys with water, drowning the Valyrian invaders and achieving victory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The First Turtle War lasted less than a moon's turn. Sar Mell was
raided and burned, <strong>yet emerged victorious when Rhoynish water
wizards called up the power of the river and flooded Volon Therys</strong>.
Half the city was washed away, if the tales can be believed.<br><sub>TWOIAF - Ancient History: 10,000 Ships</sub></p>

<h3>Second Spice War</h3>
<p>Then Prince Garin of Chroyane used Water magic extensively against Valyria in <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Second_Spice_War"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Second Spice war</a>. He met initial success, overwhelming three Dragon Lords from Volantis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Garin found himself facing <strong>a hundred thousand foes, a hundred war
elephants, and three dragonlords</strong>. Here too he prevailed, though at
great cost. Thousands burned, but thousands more sheltered in the
shallows of the river, <strong>whilst their wizards raised enormous
waterspouts against the foe's dragons. Rhoynish archers brought down
two of the dragons, whilst the third fled, wounded. In the aftermath,
Mother Rhoyne rose in rage to swallow Volon Therys</strong>. Thereafter men
began to name the victorious prince Garin the Great, and it is said
that, in Volantis, great lords trembled in terror as his host
advanced. Rather than face him in the field, <strong>the Volantenes
retreated back behind their Black Walls and appealed to the Freehold
for help</strong>.<br><sub>TWOIAF - Ancient History: 10,000 Ships</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mother Valyria answered her daughter's call and not three, but <em>three hundred Dragonlords</em> arrived from Valyria to turn the tide. They won but the cost was horrible:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And the dragons came. <strong>Not three, as Prince Garin had faced at Volon
Therys, but three hundred or more</strong>, if the tales that have come down
to us can be believed. Against their fires, the Rhoynar could not
stand. <strong>Tens of thousands burned whilst others rushed into the
river</strong>, hoping that the embrace of Mother Rhoyne would offer them
protection against dragonflame...only to drown in their mother's
embrace. Some chroniclers insist that <strong>the fires burned so hot that
the very waters of the river boiled and turned to steam</strong>. Garin the
Great was captured alive and made to watch his people suffer for their
defiance.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>At Chroyane, the <strong>cage was hung from the walls, so that the prince
might witness the enslavement of the women and children</strong> whose
fathers and brothers had died in his gallant, hopeless war...but <strong>the
prince, it is said, called down a curse upon the conquerors,
entreating Mother Rhoyne to avenge her children. And so, that very
night, the Rhoyne flooded out of season and with greater force than
was known in living memory. A thick fog full of evil humors fell, and
the Valyrian conquerors began to die of greyscale</strong>. <br><sub>TWOIAF -

<h3>Development of Dornish desert</h3>
<p>Later, Nymeria lead her ten thousand ships and landed in Dorne, seeking refuge. While she didn't practice Water Magic herself, some witches came with her who played an important role in development of Dorne:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Rhoynar brought considerable wealth with them; their artisans,
metalworkers, and stonemasons brought skills far in advance of those
achieved by their Westerosi counterparts, and their armorers were soon
producing swords and spears and suits of scale and plate no Westerosi
smith could hope to match. Even more crucially, it is said the
<strong>Rhoynish water witches knew secret spells that made dry streams flow again and deserts bloom</strong>.<br><sub>TWOIAF - Ancient History: 10,000
Ships</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rhoynar wealth, culture and technology gave a cutting edge advantage to the Martells and allowed them to conquer entire Dorne. Current House Martell is officially House Nymeros-Martell, but common usage is just Martell.</p>
<h3>Children of Forest</h3>
<p>Other than the Rhoynar, it appears that Children of the Forest also practiced a certain form of Water Magic. They used it to break the arm of Dorne, to halt the immigration of the First Men, although too late by that point. But as with most of the legends of Children of the Forest, it is doubtful:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But whether <strong>the Breaking took place in a single night, or over the
course of centuries, there can be no doubt that it occurred; the
Stepstones and the Broken Arm of Dorne give mute but eloquent
testimony to its effects</strong>. There is also much to suggest that the Sea
of Dorne was once an inland freshwater sea, fed by mountain streams
and much smaller than it is today, until the narrow sea burst its
bounds and drowned the salt marshes that lay between.</p>
<p>Even if we accept that the <strong>old gods broke the Arm of Dorne with the
Hammer of the Waters, as the legends claim, the greenseers sang their
song too late</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>No more wanderers crossed to Westeros after the Breaking, it is true, for the First Men were no seafarers</strong>...but so many of their
forebears had already made the crossing that they outnumbered the
dwindling elder races almost three to one by the time the lands were
severed, and that disparity only grew in the centuries that followed,
for the women of the First Men brought forth sons and daughters with
much greater frequency than the females of the elder races.<br><sub>TWOIAF - Dorne: the Breaking</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another attempt was made by them in a desperate effort to divide the Continent into two, by breaking it apart on Neck. It didn't succeed however and resulted in only Flooding the Neck and making it a Marshland.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Legend says that <strong>the great floods that</strong> broke the land bridge that is
now the Broken Arm and <strong>made the Neck a swamp were the work of the</strong>
<strong>greenseers</strong>, who gathered at Moat Cailin to work dark
magic.<br><sub>TWOIAF - Ancient History: the Coming of the First
Men</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Instances in current timeline 298-300 AC</h3>
<p>No there are no instances of Water Magic being practiced in the current timeline.</p>
<p>As we observed, the art is associated with the Rhoynar and the Children of the Forest.</p>
<p>Children of the Forest are extinct now along with all their arts and magic. Well officially at least, they are still alive up North but even there they haven't shown that power yet. There's however a brief mention of the above-mentioned breaking of the broken Arm of Dorne in <em>AGOT</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;But some twelve thousand years ago, <strong>the First Men appeared from the
east, crossing the Broken Arm of Dorne before it was broken</strong>. They
came with bronze swords and great leathern shields, riding horses. No
horse had ever been seen on this side of the narrow sea. No doubt the
children were as frightened by the horses as the First Men were by the
faces in the trees. As the First Men carved out holdfasts and farms,
they cut down the faces and gave them to the fire. Horror-struck, the
children went to war. <strong>The old songs say that the greenseers used
dark magics to make the seas rise and sweep away the land, shattering
the Arm, but it was too late to close the door</strong>. The wars went on
until the earth ran red with blood of men and children both, but more
children than men, for men were bigger and stronger, and wood and
stone and obsidian make a poor match for bronze. Finally the wise of
both races prevailed, and the chiefs and heroes of the First Men met
the greenseers and wood dancers amidst the weirwood groves of a small
island in the great lake called Gods Eye.<br><sub>AGOT - Bran
VII</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the Rhoynar, as we saw, they had to flee from advancing Valyrian dragonlords and take refuge in Dorne. It appears however that modern Rhoynar have forgotten the art of their ancestors (Much like remnants of Valyrians have forgotten the art of their ancestors). This is implied as in <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/135616/54887"">First Dornish War</a>, Rhoynar didn't use Water Magic against Aegon the Conqueror's dragons. In any case, it was the Rhoynar who were the toughest foes of the Valyrians in their conquest of Essos. And it was again the Rhoynar who proved to be the toughest enemies of Valyrians when Aegon the Conqueror began conquest of Westeros.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They aren't exactly ""resurrected"". The walkers (and the Night King in particular), are extremely practised wargs. They are warging into dead bodies. It kind of further bolsters the fan theory that the NK is actually Bran.</p>

<h3>Difference between Skin-Changing and Warging</h3>
<p>First of all, Warging is a specific type of Skin-Changing, exclusive to targeting canine family. If you are slipping into an organism which is neither a dog nor a wolf, <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/133371/54887"">it's not warging</a>.</p>
<h3>My Speculation</h3>
<p>That being said, Others are still shrouded in mystery in the books. We do not know their powers' nature or extent of their powers.</p>
<p>Based on my own speculation rooted in the canon, I'd say the answer is no.</p>
<p>There is no instance of Skin-Changers possessing multiple skins simultaneously. So it is unlikely that a couple of Skin-Changing Others are inside hundreds of thousands of Wights.</p>
<p>It is more like reanimation with an evil spirit rather than actually slipping into the body of the dead men.</p>
<p>The Art of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Necromancy"" rel=""noreferrer"">Necromancy</a> animates the Wights, not Skin-Changing. As Melisandre, someone well-versed in Dark arts said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Necromancy animates these wights, yet they are still only dead flesh</strong>. Steel and fire will serve for them. The ones you call the
Others are something more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Melisandre has been proven wrong before about many things.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is, Skin-Changers when in their animals' skin, can feel the same pain. Like Varamyr felt burning pain/sensation when his eagle was burnt by Melisandre or how he felt when he was inside his she-wolf and she gave birth to pups or how he felt when his she-wolf was mounted by his other wolves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Varamyr had died nine times before</strong>. He had died once from a spear thrust, once with a bear's teeth in his throat, and once in a wash of
blood as he brought forth a stillborn cub. He died his first death
when he was only six, as his father's axe crashed through his skull.
<strong>Even that had not been so agonizing as the fire in his guts</strong>, crackling
along his wings, devouring him. When he tried to fly from it, his
terror fanned the flames and made them burn hotter. One moment he had
been soaring above the Wall, his eagle's eyes marking the movements of
the men below. <strong>Then the flames had turned his heart into a blackened
cinder and sent his spirit screaming back into his own skin, and for a
little while he'd gone mad</strong>. Even the memory was enough to make him
shudder.<br><sub>ADWD-Prologue</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or how Bran feels blood in his mouth when his wolf hunts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;They do,&quot; Bran said with sudden certainty. &quot;They dream tree dreams. I
dream of a tree sometimes. A weirwood, like the one in the godswood.
It calls to me. <strong>The wolf dreams are better. I smell things, and
sometimes I can taste the blood</strong>.&quot;<br><sub>ACOK-Bran I</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or how Jon feels hunger felt by his wolf.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it was a hunger inside him, sharp as a dragonglass blade. A hunger...
he could feel it. <strong>It was food he needed, prey, a red deer that stank
of fear or a great elk proud and defiant. He needed to kill and fill
his belly with fresh meat and hot dark blood. His mouth began to water
with the thought</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>It was a long moment before he understood what was happening. When he did, he bolted to his feet. “Ghost?”</strong> He turned toward the wood,
and there he came, padding silently out of the green dusk, the breath
coming warm and white from his open jaws. “Ghost!” he shouted, and the
direwolf broke into a run.<br />
<sub> <em>A Storm Of Swords: Chapter 79</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>White Walkers, like all living things, feel pain. We saw it when Sam stabbed one, the White Shade screamed with pain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do it now. Stop crying and fight, you baby. Fight, craven. It was his
father he heard, it was Alliser Thorne, it was his brother Dickon and
the boy Rast. Craven, craven, craven. He giggled hysterically,
wondering if they would make a wight of him, a huge fat white wight
always tripping over its own dead feet. Do it, Sam. Was that Jon, now?
Jon was dead. You can do it, you can, just do it. And then he was
stumbling forward, falling more than running, really, closing his eyes
and shoving the dagger blindly out before him with both hands. <strong>He
heard a crack, like the sound ice makes when it breaks beneath a man's
foot, and then a screech so shrill and sharp that he went staggering
backward with his hands over his muffled ears</strong>, and fell hard on his
arse.<br><sub> <em>ASOS: Samwell I</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But we do not see White Walkers screaming when their minions are burned or hacked, which means they aren't feeling the pain felt by their <em>skin</em>, which in turn implies they aren't inside the dead skin at all. Or it could be just because their skin is dead, it feels no pain, therefore the Walkers feel no pain.</p>
<h3>So Spake Martin...Er or didn't spake</h3>
<p>George R.R. Martin has however <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1282/"" rel=""noreferrer"">refused to confirm</a> if Others control their minions like Skin-Changers control their skins.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, I asked a bunch of questions that got an &quot;excellent cheese&quot;
response from George, who was at least amused enough by our
observation that he used cheese to change the subject that he went on
to use cheese as the <em>only</em> subject change...</p>
<p>Do The Others warg into the bodies of the dead the same way that wargs
go &quot;into&quot; the bodies of animals?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since Author replied with Cheese, he refused to confirm it but he didn't rule it out either. So it may be possible that George has a similar idea about how their powers work.</p>
<p>So until His Grace GRRM decides to tell us more about it, we do not know for sure.</p>

"168027","How much contact with Dragonglass is needed to destroy a White Walker?","<p>There have been a few questions and comments in our community lately regarding Dragonglass and the need to have weapons (swords, arrowheads etc) made from it to combat the White Walkers.</p>

<p>In Season 3, Episode 8, Samwell kills a White Walker with a dragonglass dagger, by stabbing the Walker in the shoulder. </p>

<p>However what interested me is how deep a wound is needed to destroy a White Walker?  Is a single, shallow cut enough? If so, rather than trying to manufacture arrowheads or spear-points, men could be given slivers of dragonglass and simply throw them at the Walkers, throwing enough will almost certainly cause some wounds.  Manufactured weapons of dragonglass could then be provided to those better trained to use them.</p>

<p>There are a number of pages that talk about dragonglass killing <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Dragonglass"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">White Walkers</a>, there is not (that I can find) any discussion of the degree of wounding needed for this to succeed.</p>

<p>Is there any in-universe lore that gives this detail? </p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","168028","<p>I am only versed in show knowledge so that is where this answer will come from:</p>

<hr>

<h1>It Needs to Penetrate the Skin</h1>

<p>In the scene where Sam stabs a White Walker with the Dragonglass dagger it only penetrates the skin and the effect seems to radiate from that area. See the below:</p>

<p><div class=""youtube-embed""><div>
                <iframe width=""640px"" height=""395px"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/mAfdHNjbYHU?start=0""></iframe>
            </div></div></p>

<p>The both times we see Jon kill a White Walker is with his Valyrian steel sword, Longclaw. However, on both occasions his swipe is so strong his sword effectively goes straight through the White Walker turning it into what appears to be ice shards.</p>

<p><div class=""youtube-embed""><div>
                <iframe width=""640px"" height=""395px"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/fC1dVsTkmSI?start=0""></iframe>
            </div></div></p>

<p>Therefore, it appears that to kill one you only need to penetrate the skin of the White Walker though we only have a few occasions to go on.</p>

<hr>

<p>To back this up with some scenes from the latest episode S07E06. The wight bear is only killed when Jorah stabs it with a Dragonglass dagger:</p>

<p><div class=""youtube-embed""><div>
                <iframe width=""640px"" height=""395px"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oz80SgmrPvU?start=0""></iframe>
            </div></div></p>

<p>Also when the wights are attacking the men trapped on the island it appears the dragon glass weapons seem to just graze over the wights, though this might just be the editing not being good enough to make the attacks look like they are actually hitting.</p>

<p>This can be used as backup evidence that to kill one you only need to penetrate the skin. However, as it is about wights it might be a bit different.</p>

"168084","What is Sansa being invited to?","<p>In the episode 'Beyond The Wall', Sansa receives a note from the maester that allegedly comes from King's Landing.</p>

<p>Sansa refuses to go to King's Landing (and the Lannisters) herself and sends Brienne of Tarth as her emissary.</p>

<p>Is it also Sansa who is invited or simply whoever is in charge of Winterfell at that time?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","168854","<p>You're asking two different questions here.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is Sansa being invited to?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The negotiation between Cersei and Daenerys, where the wight is shown. Proven by the fact that Brienne actually attends this meeting. There's no reason to think that someone could attend this meeting without having explicitly been invited to it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is it also Sansa who is invited or simply whoever is in charge of Winterfell at that time?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Starks have always been the Warden of the North, which is a fancy way of calling them the governor. Historically, all Northern houses are sworn to the Starks.</p>

<p><em>To draw an analogy, before the events of season 7 the Tyrells would likely be invited to events to represent the Reach as a whole, without needing to invite the Tarlys (who are inherently sworn to the Tyrells). This makes sense, as it's pretty much the core idea of a feudal system, and it means you can have meetings without needing to invite <a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/everyone_and_their_mother"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">everyone and their mother</a>.</em></p>

<p>It stands to reason that Sansa is invited to the meeting as she is the <strong>official</strong> representative of the North (i.e. recognized by the Iron Throne).<br>
Sansa is of course backing Jon's claim as King in the North, but that's not relevant as to her invitation. Sansa is also still the governmentally appointed spokesperson for the region, which makes her presence relevant <em>regardless of her stance of the topic of Northern independence</em> (the meeting is about a truce between Danaerys and Cersei, not Northern independence).</p>

<p>Even though Jon is half Stark, his position of King in the North is unrelated to his Stark heritage (they could've made someone else King in the North and the story would be unchanged from Cersei's point of view). Cersei, representing the Iron Throne, does not recognize the King in the North, she treats them like a group of insurgents.</p>

<p>Jon's ""insurgency"" is sufficiently powerful to be relevant in the discussion of a truce (as is later evidenced by Cersei request to have Jon not swear allegiance to either queen for the duration of the truce), which means that Jon is invited for a different reason than Sansa.</p>

"31746","How is there ice in King's Landing during the summer?","<p>I'm only halfway through Game of Thrones (the book), and when I was reading last night, I got really caught up in the practicalities of this particular issue. From what I've read, this series takes place in a pre-industrialized world (no guns, electricity, <strong>refrigeration</strong>, etc.). Then I read this, on page 250 of the chapter Eddard: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Grand Maester Pycelle is talking to Ned ""...Wine no longer agrees with my digestion, I fear, but I can offer you a cup of <strong>iced milk</strong>, sweetened with honey. I find it most refreshing in this heat.”<br/><br/>
  There was no denying the heat; Ned could feel the silk tunic clinging to his chest. Thick, moist air covered the city like a damp woolen blanket, and the riverside had grown unruly as the poor fled their hot, airless warrens to jostle for sleeping places near the water, where the only breath of wind was to be found. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ned sipped politely at the iced milk. It was pleasantly cold...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So how is this possible? I was under the impression that it took them days to get from The Trident to King's Landing, and even longer to get from Winterfell to The Trident, so it's not like someone can just bring some ice down to the big city when they need it. And without refrigeration they surely can't keep ice frozen for long if it's sweltering outside. </p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","31764","<p>From what I've learned, and knowing that during my grandmother's days, this is how they <em>actually</em> did it, people cut the ice from lakes during winter and stored it packed in hay. I've never heard of anyone climbing mountains to get ice, but then there is a dearth of good ""ice mountains"" in my part of the world.</p>

<p>In my grandmother's days, they took blocks of ice and placed them in cupboards with heavy wooden walls, which thereby became refrigerated. It was a means to make milk and meat and other fresh goods last longer.</p>

<p>Ice can last surprisingly long when packed in insulating material. However, if it could possibly last during multi-year summers, I do not know. Presumably, someone in Westeros has succeeded. </p>

"168137","Why didn't they mine dragonglass earlier?","<p>In Season 5, episode 5 <em>Kill the Boy</em>, There is a dialogue between Stannis and Samwell, where Stannis told Sam that there is dragonglass in Dragonstone</p>

<p><div class=""youtube-embed""><div>
                <iframe width=""640px"" height=""395px"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZheMeLkqCTs?start=0""></iframe>
            </div></div></p>

<p>Even if he is not explicit in the amount of dragonglass, why didn't Sam ask more about it? And even after that Stannis is gone, there is still Davos, who know Dragonstone quite well. Can't he remind everyone that there is dragonglass in Dragonstone?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","168670","<p><strong>TL:DR</strong>: They were too busy fighting in the North to go straight away and they wanted proof before committing men to go down to Dragonstone.</p>

<hr>

<p>Let's look into the full conversation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stannis: You don't look like a soldier. But I'm told you killed a white walker.
  <br> Sam: I did, Your Grace.
  <br> Stannis: How?
  <br> Sam: With a dagger made of dragonglass.
  Dragonglass? What the maesters call obsidian.
  <br> Stannis: I know what it is. We have it in Dragonstone. <strong>Why would obsidian kill a walker?</strong>
  <br> Sam: <strong>I don't know.</strong> I've been going through all the old manuscripts hoping to find something, and all I've learned is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass.
  <br> Stannis: The Lady Melisandre told me that death marches on the Wall.
  <br> Sam: I've seen it, Your Grace.
  <br> Stannis: Seen what?
  <br> Sam: The army of the dead. And when they come. We have to know how to fight them.
  <br> Stannis: <strong>Keep reading, Samwell Tarly.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the dialogue it's obvious that they don't know why the Dragonglass was able to kill the White Walker only that it did. For all they know it could have been lucky that Sam managed to hit it in a weak spot. Sam is still looking into it to see if it actually was the Dragonglass that did it.</p>

<p>As @Theik mentions in the comments Stannis saying they have it at Dragonstone could just mean ""I have this awesome Dragonglass throne!"" as he never elaborates on the amount. Though why Sam never questioned Stannis more about the amount and whereabouts seems off.</p>

<p>Now they also don't know if they could trust Stannis at this point as he is seen to be hell bent on power. This quote from episode 2 seems to confirm why they didn't start straight away, though why they didn't send anyone down to actually check is beyond me. (Though the most likely explanation is that Jon was too busy being killed, killing those who rebelled and taking the North back)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jon: This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarly. He was my brother at the Night's Watch, a man I trust as much as anyone in this world. He's discovered <strong>proof</strong> that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of dragonglass.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then when Sam ""finds out"" about the Dragonglass he explains why he never thought to be confident about it before.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sam: It's a map of Dragonstone. The Targaryens built their first stronghold there when they invaded Westeros.
  <br>Gilly: That's dragonglass?
  <br>Sam: A mountain of it. Beneath the ground. <strong>Stannis told me, but I didn't think...</strong> This is important. Jon needs to know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As to the end of ""I didn't think"" well we don't know:</p>

<ul>
<li>...Stannis was telling the truth.</li>
<li>...to tell Jon.</li>
<li>...to remember this information until now.</li>
<li>...they actually had that much there.</li>
<li>...Stannis was talking about a load of the stuff.</li>
</ul>

<p>As @Odin1806 comments below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Another thing I was going to point out is Dragonstone itself. As I understand it Dragonstone is both the island and the castle. It is possible that Sam thought of only Dragonstone the castle, even if Stannis had scouted the area himself and meant Dragonstone the island with obsidian in the caves beyond.</p>

So what <strong>the chemical nature of that is and the chemical nature of fire would actually be different coming from a non-sentient being.</strong> So there’s definitely some thought into that of what that should actually look like.

<p>When Jaime loses his right hand, he has a gold prosthetic made. Then he has to re-learn how to fight using a sword in his left hand.</p>

<p>Why didn't Jaime get a prosthetic made that <em>includes</em> a sword/weapon of some kind? Like a prosthetic hand that is holding a sword, or a hook, or something more practical? Then he could have continued to use his right hand, or at least have an easier time re-learning how to fight. Something that he can switch to when he knows that he's going to fight.</p>

<p>Answers from books and/or shows are acceptable. (I personally have not read the books)</p>

<p>EDIT: Understandable that this is seen as opinion-based. I am not sure if there was some discussion of what to give Jaime for a ""new hand"" in the books or some spoken dialogue that I could have missed. Otherwise, I believe there <em>could</em> be a non primarily opinion-based answer (Mwr247's answer below) which makes sense, but I also believe Mwr answered part of the question (why not a sword) when there is still something I think could be answered.</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","168267","<p>A prosthetic hand will not be anywhere near as effective or versatile as a real one. Here are the different ranges of motion provided by the arm/wrist/fingers:</p>

<p>Considering he lost his hand from above the wrist, Jaime would be incapable of any of the degrees of motion detailed above (except supination/pronation, which would probably still be limited). These are essential in sword positioning for both attack and defense, and without them you would find yourself severely handicapped.</p>

<p>For example, how do you hold a sword up for a block, and then extend it for an attack? How would he rotate from the cutting edge to the side for a block? A low strike swinging in toward his right leg would be almost impossible to parry, because he could not angle the blade to protect from certain angles/blind spots.</p>

<p>Carrying the weight of a sword and absorbing blows would also be quite painful, not to mention how difficult it would be to affix a prosthetic to the arm that can handle all that pressure without breaking/tearing/coming off. </p>

<p>Even if it's not your dominant hand, you'll still be a more effective fighter using a real hand than a prosthetic.</p>

<p>EDIT:
As to why he wouldn't still opt to have a hook/small blade, the best we have for a definitive answer is from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QVQR020FFY"" rel=""noreferrer"">this scene</a>, where Cersei says she commissioned/designed it for him, and he remarks that a hook would be more practical. From this we can gather that while he might consider a hook if it were up to him, she's the one who made the choice, and he's decided he's ok with sticking with it. At the very least it's more visually appealing/impressive, and has been used practically to block, so maybe that's good enough for him.</p>

"168287","How did the dead recover Viserion?","<p>In the season 7 finale Euron Greyjoy asks ""can they swim?"" with regards to the wights, to which the reply was ""no"". When Viserion was hit by the Night King's javelin he fell, broke the ice and went into the water below.</p>

<p>How did the army of the dead recover Viserion (attach the chains to him) after he has been hit by the Night King's javelin?</p>

<p>As we have established that the wights can't swim, the only other explanation I can see is if one of the White Walkers swims down to attach the chains, however that also seems unlikely.</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","168340","<h2>The actual answer to your main question.</h2>

<p>Given that the wights are able to survive in water, it's perfectly possible for them to sink down to the bottom, attach the chains to Viserion, and then walk to the edge of the lake where other wights could have broken the ice so that they can exit. Or they can climb back up the chain.<br>
Or if the lake is not easily walked out of, they are simply are stuck there and no one cares. The Night King isn't known for his caring attitude.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Define ""swimming"".</h2>

<p>Most of your question is based on Euron's question about their ability to swim, but your assumption here is wrong. When a human asks the question ""can you swim?"", he can mean the following things:</p>

<ol>
<li>If I put you in water, can you <strong>survive</strong> (by swimming)?</li>
<li>Can you stay <strong>afloat</strong>?</li>
<li>Can you <strong>move around</strong> in the water?</li>
</ol>

<p>For humans, all three are the same thing. We need to move around (upwards), in order to stay at the top, so that we can breathe (and therefore not die). But this is not necessarily the case for wights. So Euron's question (and the answer it receives) hinges on the interpretation of ""swimming"".</p>

<hr>

<h2>Define ""swimming"" for wights.</h2>

<p><strong>1. Can the wights survive in water?</strong></p>

<p>Yes they can. This is evidenced by (S07E06) the wights who rose up out of the water to try and drag Thormund down. Being submerged in water does not kill a wight.</p>

<p><strong>2. Can wights stay afloat?</strong></p>

<p>As far as we've seen, and can logically deduce, most of them cannot.</p>

<p>From what we have seen, wights sink into the water immediately (as evidenced by S07E06).   </p>

<p>There is the question of how the wights managed to come back up top (when dragging Thormund down). Though not explicitly shown, it's possible that a sufficient amount of wights has fallen into the water, that they basically made a human pyramid (erhm, zombie pyramid) to get back up.<br>
Note that while we did not see it happen underwater, the wights who attacked Jon in S07E06 (who was standing on the raised edge of the island) <strong>did</strong> actually pile on top of eachother in order to get to Jon, so there's at least some precedent for the wights being able to use ""ant tactics"" and use eachother for climbing.</p>

<p>Frow what we can logically deduce, wight have either no flesh, or less flesh than humans. Flesh is more buoyant than bones, and therefore a human is more buoyant than a wight. When comparing fleshy wights to skeletal wights, you'd expect the former to be slightly more buoyant than the latter (though still less than a human).</p>

<p><strong>3. Can wights move around in the water?</strong></p>

<p>Similar to the buoyancy argument, wights will be considerably less able of doing so than humans, and skeletal wights will be considerably less able than fleshy wights.</p>

<p>The wights are denser than the average human, and therefore sink faster. This means that a swimming wight would have to already <strong>swim better</strong> than a human, due to needing to counteract gravity more.</p>

<p>Moving around in the water is done through ""paddles"". Flat pieces of surface that are used for pushing off against the water (essentially the same as a wing). A duck's webbed feed, the oars of a boat, a boat's propeller blades, a swimmer's hands, ... all of these examples try to <strong>maximize the surface area</strong> in order to increase their efficiency.</p>

<p>But wights are barebones (pun intended) as far as paddles go. They are thin and dense, which is the exact oppose of what you want (large and not too dense).<br>
Fleshy wights who still have full arms and legs may be able to still use them as paddles, but they would still have to be <strong>better</strong> than humans (due to sinking faster), and it's even possible for the necromancy (however it works) to not understand how swimming works in the first place.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Conclusion about the swimming.</h2>

<p>Wights can <strong>survive</strong> in water, but they are mostly incapable of <strong>moving around</strong> in water. It stands to reason that they can <strong>walk on the bottom</strong> though.</p>

<p>We can't know which definition of swimming Euron was focusing on. We can somewhat deduce that whoever answered the question (I'm not sure who it was) was thinking about <strong>moving around</strong> in water, not <strong>surviving</strong>.</p>

<p>Also note that <strong>if the wights were keen on travelling through water, they could easily have circumvented the Wall</strong>. Most of the argument as to why they did not circumvent it relies on the impracticality of doing so (no fleet, it creates a bottleneck, ...) but those arguments go out the window when they can just walk on the ocean bed like it's nobody's business.</p>

","<game-of-thrones><dragons>","168336","<h2>Magic is not the answer (in this case)</h2>

<p>Magic  is not the correct answer here, in my opinion. There are many things about the dragons that <em>can</em> be answered by magic:</p>

<ul>
<li>How Viserion was born from a petrified egg</li>
<li>How zombie Viserion was resurrected from a corpse</li>
<li>How Viserion's dragonfire is different from normal fire</li>
<li>How zombie Viserion's icefire works in the first place</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note that I didn't mention ""why dragons breathe fire"". There seems to be a semi-scientific approach here. When you look into a dragon's mouth, you see <a href=""http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d803ad988e1340aec96da0a61c891e74.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">two little holes at the back of the jawline</a>. This is the source of the dragon's fire, it basically functions like a blowtorch. So there is at least <strong>some</strong> explanation as to how they breathe fire, it's not <strong>just</strong> magic.</em></p>

<p>However, the dragon's <strong>flight</strong> has always been shown as realistic flight, basing itself on the principles of physics.</p>

<ul>
<li>The dragons flap their wings, lifting themselves with every flap</li>
<li>They do not fly in a straight line when flapping their wings (only when gliding)</li>
<li>They glide</li>
<li>They have a turning radius and are limited by inertia</li>
<li>They cannot hover. Though they are able to fly in place for short periods (e.g. just before landing), they cannot keep this up for long. Which makes sense, as hovering costs considerably more effort than normal flight (which is mostly done through gliding and only requires flappign of the wings to maintain their altitude).</li>
<li>Zombie Viserion flies <strong>exactly</strong> like all of the living dragons have always flown.</li>
<li>Since wights do not tire, it's possible that zombie Viserion is able to fly in place indefinitely, simply because he does not tire like living dragons. Regardless, his capability of flying in place is still physically sound (even if his lack of exhaustion is not).</li>
</ul>

<p>For these reasons, I'm arguing that in regards to dragons' flight, <strong>magic is not a valid answer</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>So how can Viserion fly with holes in his wings?</strong></p>

<p>First of all, the holes aren't <em>that</em> big. They are little holes compared to the total surface area of his remaining wing.<br>
<em>Somewhat offtopic but relevant as to the core of your question: wights don't seem to rot much after resurrection (as far as we've seen, which is little to go on to be honest), so it's possible that Viserion isn't actively rotting because he hasn't been dead for long enough. I am not arguing that I know for a fact that he isn't rotting; I'm just arguing that you can't know for a fact that he <strong>is</strong>.</em></p>

<p>You're right that Viserion should be <em>less efficient</em> at flying with holes in his wings (compared to Viserion without holes), but he shouldn't be <em>incapable</em> of doing so (unless the holes are big enough, which does not seem to be the case from what we have seen so far).</p>

<p><strong>But his movement is through necromancy?</strong></p>

<p>You need to distinguish between the <em>source</em> of the movement and the <em>effect</em> of the movement.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Necromancy animates these wights.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Melisandre said, the necromancy <strong>makes the wights move</strong>. But that does not mean that every consequence of this movement is also caused by necromancy.</p>

<p>If a wight swings a sword, hits a soldier and cuts his skin, did necromancy cut that man's skin? No, it did not. The <strong>sword</strong> did.<br>
That sword would have cut that skin regardless of who swung the sword.</p>

<ul>
<li>A skeletal (or zombie) arm moving around is due to <strong>necromancy</strong>.  </li>
<li>A sword moving around because it's being held by a moving skeletal arm is due to <strong>physics</strong>.</li>
<li>That sword hitting someone and cutting them is due to <strong>physics</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Now applying the same to Viserion:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A zombie dragon wing moving around is due to <strong>necromancy</strong>.</li>
<li>The dragon being lifted off the ground because it flaps its wings is due to <strong>physics</strong>.</li>
<li>The dragon flying through the air because of its altitude and glide capabilities is due to <strong>physics</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>But how does he fly then?</strong></p>

<p>Coming back to my earlier point, you're right that zombie Viserion should be <em>less efficient</em> at flying (compared to Viserion), but he shouldn't be <em>incapable</em> of doing so.  </p>

<p>Physical flight works under the following (drastically simplified) principle:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lift force = drag of the wing * force of flapping the wing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To achieve the same lift (flight capabilities), if zombie Viserion has a lower wing drag (due to the holes), he can make up for it by putting more force behind his wing.<br>
This would mean that in practice, zombie Viserion would flap his wing <em>faster</em> than he used to. This detail may have been omitted from the show because the animators did not consider it to such a detailed degree. </p>

<p>Let's look at the wights again, specifically the skeletal ones. While they are relatively easily smashed to pieces, they are still capable of swinging a sword without ripping themselves apart. If their strength only came from their physical structure, then they would probably fall apart at the first swing.<br>
So it stands to reason that <strong>necromancy</strong> (the force that moves their bones) adds a bit of extra force to their movement.  It then also stands to reason that Viserion can be stronger than he was before, which can explain the added force needed to flap his wing.</p>

<h2>Viserion can fly with holes in his wings since planes can do the same thing</h2>

<p>From the information given it would appear that all wights can be killed by these weapons but we simply don't have enough to go on.</p>

<p>was released at an audience with Cersei, which then ran directly at her only to be restrained by its chains barely before reaching her.</p>

<p>What struck me as odd is that no one near Cersei seemed to even try to get between her and her attacker, who <a href=""https://giphy.com/embed/t0jaduK1u9MCk"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">had started running from a considerable distance <strong>(spoiler link)</strong></a>.

Even if he wasn't an extremely experienced warrior, a bodyguard of that size could simply protect by sheer mass. In fact, bodyguards in real life generally get between the guarded and the attacker as soon as possible.</p>

<p>We don't know but it actually appears to be a lack of time for the Mountain to get in the way.

We see him move in front of her for protection a few times, even in the same scene when Sandor approaches.</p>
<p>As for why he doesn't in this occasion he doesn't have enough time to actually block the wights path as it approaches quickly. However, if you watch closely in the background he does grab his sword but we don't see if he pulls it out or not. He also appears to be as startled as the rest of them when it starts approaching her.</p>

<p>Also note that once Sandor pulls the wight back both Jaime and the Mountain have moved into protective positions around Cersei. The Mountain has also drawn his sword at this point. This backs up the theory that they were just slow to react and were startled at first.</p>
<p>As for why the other 6 Queensguard, Jaime and Euron don't react:</p>
<ul>
<li>6 Queensguard: Are startled and don't have the time to get there anyway and also probably thought The Mountain would handle it.</li>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> There is a meeting between Lannisters, Starks and Targaryens for a truce at the Dragonpit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who decided the meeting place and why?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","168351","<p><strong>Cersei probably decide to organize the meeting in Dragonpit for its background</strong></p>

<p>We don't know for sure who decided what for the meeting, but we can speculate that Tyrion organized the meeting, but let Cersei decide the place. And the place is not neutral.</p>

<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragonpit"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dragonpit</a> is a good place to show the decadence of Targaryen dynasty</p>

<p>Let's see briefly the history of the Dragonpit :</p>

<p><strong>Rhaeny's Hill before Dragonpit, and destruction of the Sept of Remembrance :</strong> </p>

<p>Dragonpit is located at Hill of Rhaenys, named after the sister-Queen of Aegon I. Aegon was really attached to Rhaenys, who died during the first Dornish war. In memory of her, Aegon built the Sept of Remembrance</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Sept_of_Remembrance"" rel=""noreferrer"">Sept of remembrance</a> was an important place during the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Faith_Militant_uprising"" rel=""noreferrer"">Faith Militant uprising</a>, a huge rebellion against the Targaryens.
Long story short, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Maegor_I_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Maegor the cruel</a> burnt the sept to the ground. He was the one who decided to built the Dragonpit.</p>

<p><strong>Dragonpit's construction</strong></p>

<p>Because Maegor had killed all those who had built the Red Keep, to hide its secrets, many fled rather than work on the Dragonpit. Maegor had to use city prisoners, with supervisors from Myr and Volantis. We are starting to understand where the epithet of Maegor come from.</p>

<p><strong>Dragonpit and size of dragons</strong></p>

<p>We know that the last dragons were really small. The reasons seems to be Dragonpit : Dragons which are locked up, e.g. the Targaryen dragons housed in the Dragonpit , did not grow as large as dragons left free to fly as they wished.</p>

<p><strong>Dragonpit's destruction</strong></p>

<p>Dragonpit was destroyed in 130AC, during <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Riot_of_King%27s_Landing_(Dance_of_the_Dragons)"" rel=""noreferrer"">riots</a>, in the middle of the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dance_of_the_Dragons"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dance of the Dragons</a>. The Shepherd, a kind of prophet, lead the smallfolk to Dragonpit, to kill the dragons. 4 dragons died, and the last one, Dreamfyre flew into the pit's great dome above, which cracked on impact and half of it came tumbling down, crushing her.</p>

<p>So, to resume it, Dragonpit was constructed by a mad king after a rebellion, and destroyed during riots in context of civil war, and lead to the exctinction of dragons.</p>

<p>There are other reason for this place :</p>

<ul>
<li>It is one of the most isolated place in King's Landing, allowing them be isolated from smallfolk and armies</li>
<li>Out of universe, Dragonpit is one of the most important parts of King's Landing that have been never seen before. Always good to show new places!</li>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Queen Cersei meets Daenerys, Jon Snow, and Tyrion to discuss the truce extended by Daenerys.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just before she goes down to the Dragonpit, she gives the Mountain (Ser Gregor Clegane) a set of instructions:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> ""If anything goes wrong, kill the silver-haired bitch first. Then our brother, then the bastard who calls himself King. The rest of them you can kill in any order you see fit.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we know that number 2 was Tyrion, and number 3 was Jon Snow. But who was the first?</p>

<p>I know, it might seem obvious that she was talking about Daenerys. As a Targaryen, she is famous for the silver hair of her people. But I was reading <a href=""https://www.buzzfeed.com/andyneuenschwander/80-thoughts-i-had-watching-the-game-of-thrones-finale-this?utm_term=.eeY0gPP7a#.ix3b3DDK4"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> list and got a bit stuck at number 6. Could she possibly have been talking about Brienne of Tarth?</p>

<p>It's obvious that she has a bit of a thing against Brienne for being (maybe) in love with Jaime, as she accused her of during the Purple wedding. And later, the three of them exchange some very charged glances, centered on Jaime. Also, Cersei says ""Noone walks away from me"" which could mean she thinks Jaime might still feel something for Brienne.</p>

<p>Another thing. Jaime never blinked an eye when Cersei killed innocents and destroyed the Sept of Baelor. And this was after he stabbed the Mad King in the back for wanting to burn the entire city with wildfire, which was what Cersei used on the Sept of Baelor. She killed her daughter-in-law, father-in-law, cousin, betrothed and (indirectly) caused her son Tommen to commit suicide. But Jaime didn't have that much of a problem with the attack.</p>

<p>Here, she is telling the Mountain who to kill <em>if anything goes wrong</em>. Which means she had no plans to cause trouble at the meeting, but she had every suspicion that the others might (warranted, I guess for a not-so-beloved Queen). And she was telling the Mountain who to kill first, should something happen. Far less terrible than blowing up the Sept of Baelor. And yet Jaime looks so horrified/disgusted/disbelieving at this.</p>

<p>After his vow to cut Tyrion in half, I doubt he felt awful on his brother's behalf. And there's no reason for him to particularly care about Jon. So the only reason he could have strong feelings against what Cersei said was in regards to the 'silver-haired bitch"". If it meant Daenerys, again not much reason for Jaime's reaction.</p>

<p>But Brienne's hair is almost exactly the same shade as Daenerys' (in the show at least). And if Jaime does have feelings for her, it might make him react that way.</p>

<p>I'm not asking for an opinion-based answer. I'm asking if there is any conclusive proof that Cersei was indeed talking about Daenerys, or otherwise. Leaked scripts, or comments from the producers or the actors themselves would be ideal.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><character-motivation>","168602","<p>Brienne of Tarth is described as having <strong>Straw Coloured Hair</strong> in the books and blonde in the show to match. Daenerys is described as having <strong>pale, Silver/Gold hair</strong> as Targaryens are known to. Dany is also (in Cersei's eyes) the attempting usurper in charge of foreign armies and dragons. She is the literal closest and greatest threat to Cersei's rule and life, and the most likely person to be laying a trap at the meeting Dany requested. </p>

<p>So it's almost unequivocal that Cersei meant to kill Daenerys, her greatest threat, first.</p>

<p>I assume the worst.</p>

<p>She is explaining that rather than following his lesson and applying it to Arya, she instead asked that same question about him. Sansa knows he killed Lysa.

<p>So off-screen she must have spoken to Arya and come to the truth. Then speaking to Bran, they learned even more about what Littlefinger has done, some of which he said in the trial itself.</p>

"168375","How did the Unsullied travel in season 7 finale?","<p>The Unsullied were stuck on Casterly Rock the last time we saw them. This episode showed them stand around the castle in King's Landing. </p>

<p>How did they get there?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","169407","<h1>They Walked</h1>

<p>To explain further the Unsullied were never stuck at Casterly Rock in the first place. They took the rock and whilst they were busy doing so Euron and his fleet destroyed the Unsullied ships.</p>

<p><div class=""youtube-embed""><div>
                <iframe width=""640px"" height=""395px"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/NhyIhqEX7wo?start=94""></iframe>
            </div></div></p>

<p>They presumably then left the Unsullied there with a long walk to wherever they needed to go, as it was they needed to go to King's Landing. They can easily do this by walking.</p>

<p>Lastly, along the way I doubt they would have had to fight anyone as the Lannister army appears to be spread thin but those commanded by Jaime will be back in King's Landing as Jaime and his captains are there. Also they need a force in case it is a trap and Dany decides to take action with her armies.</p>

<p>We also know that Euron is back at King's Landing, as he is present at the meeting, and that his fleet is there also. As you can see in the following clip.</p>

<p><div class=""youtube-embed""><div>

<p>So even if Euron could have besieged them somehow he isn't there to do so.</p>

"168397","Does Jaime Lannister have any claim to the Iron Throne?","<p>The question is quite simple, <strong>does Jaime Lannister have any claim to the Iron Throne? In other words, how far down in the succession is he?</strong></p>

<p>After all, his sister is currently the <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/133037/can-cersei-lannister-claim-the-iron-throne-and-legitimize-her-act"">Queen</a>, so if she dies, does he get the Throne? The succession is not quite <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/93775/succession-of-the-iron-throne-after-got-season-5-spoilers-whos-in-line"">clear</a>, but Jaime is related to the current Queen and has the support of the Lannister armies (not so clear after the last episode though I have to admit).</p>

<p>A similar <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/33653/why-didnt-jaime-lannister-succeed-aerys-targaryen-in-place-of-robert-baratheon"">question</a> asks about why Jaime didn't get the Throne after killing the Mad King, which is a very different situation, so mine's not a dupe.</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","168398","<p>Unless Jaime is descended from a Targaryen king, he has no claim to the throne based on his blood. He is not a blood relation of the Targaryens to my best knowledge, so he is not in the line of succession.</p>

<p>The Baratheons are considered extinct (not counting the bastard son, Gendry). So if the direct Targaryen line is also broken, then a cadet branch of the Targaryen family would make a blood claim to the throne.</p>

<p>Cersei has no blood claim to the throne. She just happened to be the queen consort and queen mother of previous kings. But knowing Cersei, she wanted the throne, and she was not going to allow mere legalities get in the way. She probably coerced the Small Council and various lords to support her claim saying there was nobody else alive with a claim. (Notwithstanding Daenarys whom Cersei calls a usurper).</p>

<p>If Cersei was a legitimate queen and the line of succession was based solely on birth order (not just male heirs first), then Jaime would be next in line. He would inherit the throne if she died without living children.</p>

"168413","Is the Golden Company considered Westerosi in Westeros?","<p>A few of the characters mentioned ""the foreign invaders"" when referring to the Unsullied and the Dothraki. However, the same doesn't seem to apply to the Golden Company. I know a bit about the history, but I imagined they would recruit a lot in Essos. How come they're not considered foreign?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","168417","<h2>They are comprised mostly of Westerosi exiles and bastards, and so would fit the 'Westerosi' description</h2>

<hr />

<p>Ok, so, in general, there are a fair amount of differences between the <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> and the <em>Game of Thrones</em> canon. However, the history and foundation of the <strong>Golden Company</strong> seems to be the same in both. Albeit their compositions being slightly differently portrayed:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Golden_Company#Composition"" rel=""noreferrer"">Books</a>: 10,000 men, several thousands horses and a number of elephants.</li>

<p>Now, the <strong><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Golden_Company"" rel=""noreferrer"">Golden Company</a></strong> was founded by an ex-Targaryen and <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Blackfyre"" rel=""noreferrer"">Blackfyre</a> loyalist, in Essos, called <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegor_Rivers"" rel=""noreferrer"">Aegor 'Bittersteel' Rivers</a><sup>1</sup>. This is important, given that although Bittersteel is primarily from the Targaryen family, he's actually as Westerosi as Dany is; in that he was exiled and lived much of his life in Essos.</p>

<p>In fact, although there are many notable Westerosi members, the majority of them are actually Essosi or Westerosi exiles, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Black Balaq

<ul>
<li>Yes, he is in fact 'Black'</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Myles Toyne

<li>Exiled member of House Toyne</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Lysono Maar

<ul>
<li>Lyseni spymaster, yet he speaks the common tongue well</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h1>Our word is good as gold</h1>

<p>The Golden Company is renown for not having broken a contract, ever. Until now. You see although their mantra is Bittersteel's dream<sup>2</sup>, they dream of returning home, to Westeros. This will give Cersei her advantage over the Dothraki or Unsullied, in that most of the members are either bastards or exiled knights or lords <em>from Westeros</em>.</p>

<p>They'll be able to relate, look like and understand the Westerosi culture. In fact, many of them still garb themselves in Westerosi knightly fashion.</p>

<h1>Black or red, a dragon is still a dragon</h1>

<p>This will be interesting, if the show runners have the opportunity to delve into all of this, perhaps it could spell doom for Cersei. Given that there's a connection with Illyrio and Varys to the Golden Company:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tyrion:</strong> How did you convince the Golden Company to take up the cause of our sweet queen when they have spent so much of their history fighting against the Targaryens?<br>
  <strong>Illyrio:</strong> Black or red, a dragon is still a dragon. When Maelys the Monstrous died upon the Stepstones, it was the end of the male line of House Blackfyre. And Daenerys will give the exiles what Bittersteel and the Blackfyres never could.

"168430","Why did Shae act as she did at the trial?","<p>In <em>Game of Thrones, Season 4</em>, why did Shae betray Tyrion at his trial? </p>

<p>Did Shae ever love Tyrion, or was he right in thinking that she only loved his gold and the lifestyle he provided? </p>
","<game-of-thrones>","168447","<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This answer will be strictly about TV show, not the books. In the books things are completely different.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Did she love him?</h3>
<p>In the Show, Shae indeed loved Tyrion. She proved it when Tyrion suggested that she should flee before Stannis takes over King's Landing. Shae on the other hand rejected his proposal, risking her life, deciding to stay with him till the bitter end. No amount of money can make a person do that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shae: Are you afraid, my lion?</p>
<p>Tyrion: If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can
find. Of course I'm afraid.</p>
<p>Shae: I won't let them hurt you.</p>
<p>Tyrion: I'm a Lannister. I don't have a choice in all this. <strong>But it's</strong>
<strong>not your war</strong>.</p>
<p>Shae: <strong>It is now</strong>.</p>
<p>Tyrion: You can't fuck your way out of everything.</p>
<p>Shae: I have so far. Do you remember what you said when you met me in
your tent? That I should make love to you like it was your last day on
this earth.<br><sub><em><strong>Season 2 Episode 9 - Blackwater</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Tyrion got hideous facial injuries, was stripped off his post as Hand of the King, lost his Gold Cloaks and the Tribesmen. At his most vulnerable position Shae came to see him. She made it clear for him that she didn't care about the Money.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tyrion: It was good of you to come.</p>
<p>Shae: Good of me? Of course I come. I want to see you.</p>
<p>Tyrion: Believe me, you don't.</p>
<p>Shae: Have you looked? I will be the first.</p>
<p>Tyrion: Well?</p>
<p>Shae: You are a mess.</p>
<p>Tyrion: I'm a monster as well as a dwarf.  <strong>You should charge me</strong>
<strong>double</strong>.</p>
<p>Shae: <strong>You think I'm here for money?</strong></p>
<p>Tyrion: That was the arrangement we made.I pay you and you lie to me.</p>
<p>Shae: Oh. I'm a poor little rich man and nobody loves me, so I make
jokes all the time and pay them to laugh. <strong>Fuck your money</strong><br><sub><em><strong>Season 2 Episode 10 - Valar Morghulis</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She proved it further when she next suggested that Tyrion should flee into exile with her and she was Okay with him being a penniless exile and still wanted to be with him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shae: Let's leave.</p>
<p>Tyrion: Leave?</p>
<p>Shae: Leave King's Landing. They tried to kill you. They will try
again. Going into wars, fighting soldiers, you're terrible at this.
<strong>Let's take a boat to Pentos and never come back.</strong> You don't belong
here.</p>
<p>Tyrion: What would we do in Pentos?</p>
<p>Shae: Eat, drink, fuck, live.</p>
<p>Tyrion: I want to go with you.</p>
<p>Shae: So do it. Your father, your sister, all these bad people, they
can't stop you. Forget about them. Come with me.</p>
<p>Tyrion: <strong>I can't. I do belong here.</strong> These bad people are what I'm good
at. Outtalking them, outthinking them. It's what I am. And I like it.
I like it more than anything I've ever done. <strong>Are you going to leave</strong>?</p>
<p>Shae: You have a shit memory. <strong>I am yours and you are mine</strong>.<br><sub><em><strong>Season 2 Episode 10 - Valar Morghulis</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Then Why betray him?</h3>
<p>They started drifting apart in Season 3. Shae already suspected that Tyrion found Sansa attractive. Tyrion found the notion absurd. And apparently Shae seemed content with his denials.</p>
<p>But The drift cemented when Sansa and Tyrion were about to be forcibly married. Tyrion wanted to speak to both Sansa and Shae separately but Shae refused to leave and Sansa refused to dismiss her. Tyrion was forced to inform Sansa of his father's plan in front of Shae. He did pass a code worded apology to Shae, but she either didn't understand it or was too furious to consider it. For her, it was Tyrion who betrayed her for a highborn girl.</p>
<p>The significant blow came before Tyrion's marriage. Shae still harbored hopes that Tyrion might choose exile for her but he refused and Shae realized that she always was and always will be just another whore for Tyrion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shae: So, am I invited to your wedding?</p>
<p>Tyrion: I didn't ask for this marriage. I didn't want it.</p>
<p>Shae: No? She's a beautiful girl. You said so yourself.</p>
<p>Tyrion: That doesn't mean that, this is duty, not desire.</p>
<p>Shae: Is that what you will tell yourself when you fuck her?</p>
<p>Tyrion: I don't have a choice. My father</p>
<p>Shae: Does not rule the world. <strong>We can still go across the Narrow Sea.</strong></p>
<p>Tyrion: <strong>What would I do there? Juggle?</strong> I am a Lannister of Casterly
Rock.</p>
<p>Shae: And I'm Shae the funny whore.</p>
<p>Tyrion: My feelings for you have not changed. I will marry Sansa Stark
and do my duty by her.</p>
<p>Shae: While I empty her chamber pot and lick your cock when you're
bored?</p>
<p>Tyrion: I swear to you it will not be like that.</p>
<p>Shae: No? What will it be like?</p>
<p>Tyrion: I will buy you a good home somewhere in the city. You will
have fine clothes, guards to keep you safe, servants. Any children we
might have will be well provided for.</p>
<p>Shae: Children? You think I want children who can never see their
father? Who would be killed in their sleep if their grandfather found
out about them?</p>
<p>Tyrion: Listen. Listen to me, my lady.</p>
<p>Shae: I'm not your lady.</p>
<p>Tyrion: You are. You'll always be my lady.</p>
<p>Shae: <strong>I'm your whore. And when you are tired of fucking me, I will be</strong>
<strong>nothing</strong>.<br><sub><em><strong>Season 3 Episode 7 - The bear and the maiden fair</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later Varys tried to pay her for leaving, she rejected the bag of diamonds and said if Tyrion wants her to leave, he can bloody well ask her himself.</p>
<p>Shae still harbored hopes and tried to seduce Tyrion at number of occasions, Tyrion always made some excuse, which only deepened the rift.</p>
<p>By that time, Shae's presence had been noted by Cersei. Growing anxious for Shae's safety, given Tywin's threat that he'd hang the next whore he found in Tyrion's bed, Tyrion decided it was time to break up for good and have Shae ferried to safety, whatever the cost. Tyrion was very cruel to her, even though he was just pretending to have her leave King's Landing, but it broke Shae's heart.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shae: What's wrong, my lion?</p>
<p>Tyrion: Don't call me that.</p>
<p>Shae: What should I call you?</p>
<p>Tyrion: I'm afraid our friendship can't continue.</p>
<p>Shae: Our friendship?</p>
<p>Tyrion: There's a ship waiting in the harbor bound for Pentos.</p>
<p>Shae: What?</p>
<p>Tyrion: You'll have your own cabin, of course, and across the Narrow
Sea a house, servants.</p>
<p>Shae: What is this?</p>
<p>Tyrion: I'm a married man. My wife has suffered a great deal, as you
well know. I don't want her to suffer anymore on my account. I need to
uphold my vows.</p>
<p>Shae: She doesn't want you.</p>
<p>Tyrion: I need to do right by her.</p>
<p>Shae: You don't want her.</p>
<p>Tyrion: By our children.</p>
<p>Shae: What are you afraid of?</p>
<p>Tyrion: I'm not afraid.</p>
<p>Shae: You are. You are afraid of your father and your sister. You're
going to run from them all your life?</p>
<p>Tyrion: I need you to leave.</p>
<p>Shae: I'm not afraid of them. I'm not going to run.</p>
<p>Tyrion: Shae.</p>
<p>Shae: We will fight them together. It's like you said, I am yours and
you are mine.</p>
<p>Tyrion: <strong>You're a whore! Sansa is fit to bear my children and you are</strong>
<strong>not</strong>. I can't be in love with a whore. I can't have children with a
whore. How many men have you been with?</p>
<p>Shae: How many whores have you been with?</p>
<p>Tyrion: I have enjoyed my time with all of them and I have enjoyed my
time with you most of all. But now that time is over. You'll have a
comfortable life in Pentos. Bronn will escort you to your ship.<br><sub><em><strong>Season 4 Episode 2 - The Lion and the Rose</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that was it, Tyrion confirmed it that for him she was just a whore and everything he said before was a lie and he was now going to enjoy his life with his new wife and sire children on her, which Shae was unfit for. Shae was now going to be what Tyrion thought she was, a whore. So she sold out.</p>
<p>Later, At Tyrion's trial, she scathingly threw it in Tyrion's teeth when he pleaded for her to stop.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tyrion: Shae. Please don't.</p>
<p>Shae: <strong>I am a whore. Remember?</strong><br><sub><em><strong>Season 4 Episode 6 - The laws of Gods and Men</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<ol>
<li>Shae did love Tyrion with all her heart.</li>
<li>Tyrion crushed her heart by calling her a whore and unfit to be the mother of his children.</li>
<li>Shae paid back, by selling out and being a whore.</li>
<li>It is a twisted, sad story. Both of them loved each other but both of them thought the other had betrayed them. Both tried to kill the other (Shae at trial, Tyrion in his father's chambers), Tyrion succeeded.</li>

"168466","Does Tyrion despise the women he is romantically involved with?","<p>In Tysha's case,  Tyrion witnessed a gang rape scene, but it seems his (usually excellent) analytical abilities failed him and he readily believed that his lover betrayed him and was seduced by gold.</p>

<p>In Shae's case, it seems after a few months of trying to convince her what a danger she would be from Tywin and Cersei, he is deeply hurt when in an orchestrated trial Shae falsely accuses him.<br>
It seems at this point he is fully convinced that the only reason she betrayed him was money, and he 'punishes' her by killing her, without even giving her a chance to explain the circumstances she was in.</p>

<p>It seems the thought that Shae made a deal with Tyrion's powerful and intimidating relatives to ensure her safety or that she was coerced into giving a false testimony never occurred to him.</p>

<p>Can it be that Tyrion has such a low self-esteem that he is convinced no women can love him and he'd readily believes they're all out to betray him?</p>

<p>Or does he simply despises women from the lower classes and think them automatically guilty and acting out of self-interest, therefore he is not interested to hear out their side?</p>

<p>First of all I would like to thank you for asking a really good question, it's been a long time since I thoroughly enjoyed writing an answer. </p>

<p>Since this question is about a certain aspect of Tyrion's personality, I think we need to discuss which events affected the growth of that certain aspect of his personality first.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Tyrion's insecurities</h2>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ViFecm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ViFecm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Tyrion was more than aware of his short-comings. He was born in a family famed for beauty, wealth and strength. He lacked two of them and had wealth only thanks to his father. To make matters even worse, his father was a cold man who had an ideal about what Lannisters should be like, which was perfection. Anyone who didn't meet that ideal was beneath him. And sadly for Tyrion, he didn't quite manage to pass on that criteria. </p>

<p>For the outside world, Tyrion learnt long ago that while cruel words can hurt, it hurts even more to let people know that they got to you. So he was most accomplished at wearing a facade, a mask which didn't let slip that he was hurt by names such as imp etc and other cruel japes. </p>

<p>But that Facade never helped him when he was in front of his father. Whenever his father's piercing gaze was upon him, Tyrion suddenly became hyper-aware of all his short-coming. He could sense how his waddling was embarrassing, how his height was embarrassing, how his mismatched legs were embarrassing, how his mismatched eyes were embarrassing and how he was the very personification of Embarrassment. </p>

<p>That sort of up-bringing crushed his self-esteem but the kindness of his uncles, Aunt and his brother saw him through that and ensured that the poor lad didn't commit suicide. They however could not lift his own sense of self-worth (His uncles did try, for example Gerion Lannister used to make him recite 16 wonders of the world in front of entire West whenever there was a feast, when Tyrion was a child. Tyrion felt very proud of his accomplishments. His aunt Genna, who took up a maternal role for the Lannister orphans after Joanna died, also recognized Tyrion's intelligence and used to favor him instead of Cersei apparently), at least not around his father. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Tyrion's Love Life</h2>

<p>With that done, now we have to discuss the cases of the Women he has been romantically involved with and those who want to be romantically involved with him. </p>

<h3>Tysha</h3>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HB7olm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/HB7olm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Tyrion's first and for almost a certainty, only love, comes first. She's the only girl who ever truly and unconditionally loved Tyrion for what he was, Tyrion reciprocated with same if not deeper feelings. </p>

<p>She was an orphan, daughter of a Crofter, on her way to nowhere really as she lost her place when her father died. He met her on road while she was running from two men who were trying to rape her. Jaime chased the men and went back to the Rock to get more help as it offended him that Outlaws would dare strike on innocent travelers this close to the Rock. Tyrion on the other hand escorted Tysha to an inn, fed her and before they knew it, they were sharing a bed. Tyrion recalls that she was very lovely. She was a virgin and by morning, Tyrion was in love with her.</p>

<p>Tyrion married her by bribing a drunk septon. But he was very well aware that his father would never accept a Crofter's daughter as his daughter-in-law, wed to second in line to the throne of the ancient Kings of the Rock. So he found a way but it didn't work out very well. He set her up in a cottage and they played on being husband and wife for few weeks until the Septon he had bribed to marry them told Lord Tywin.</p>

<p>Then Tywin crushed him. He made Jaime confess that he had hired a virgin whore to make a man out of Tyrion. Then he gave her up to his garrison and bid Tyrion watch. Then he had Tyrion take her as well. </p>

<p>Tyrion hated his father for that. It crushed Tyrion, made him think that no normal woman would ever love a creature as hideous as him. It was all for his money, all a ploy. </p>

<p>He was still hurt by it, it's his POV, he thinks that smoke was stinging his eyes when he was retelling the tale to Bronn, when in fact was on verge of crying. </p>

<p>But it all made sense, right? He only had to look at himself. Why would a girl like Tysha want to be with a hideous malformed dwarf like him? He only had his money, yes that's what it was all about. His father was right. She was a gold-digger. </p>

<p>Except that she wasn't. She was just an innocent girl who truly loved Tyrion, who saved her from rapists, made her laugh, reassured her. Lord Tywin forced Jaime to confess that she was a whore, he told him that she only wanted Tyrion's gold so she was no better than a whore. And that Tyrion would thank him in future for getting him rid of this low-born whore. </p>

<p>This belief was cemented even further as he saw his father trying desperately to find a match for him among the nobles. He got so desperate by the end that he even offered to take soiled daughters of minor Lords as his daughter in law. And even they rejected the proposal. </p>

<p>Tyrion was now sure, why would any woman ever want him unless he paid her? So he started seeking solace among whores, as they were the only women who'd ever want to be with him, even if it was just for his gold.</p>

<p>But the ghost of Tysha never left him. It kept haunting him. He kept telling himself he was free of Tysha, yet he never was. Even as he was on brink of death in the aftermath of Battle of Blackwater, he was subconsciously dreaming about the brief happy married life he had with Tysha. </p>

<p>He was never free of her. He always loved her. Whatever hatred he felt towards her turned into enormous guilt as Jaime told him the truth. He had watched his wife getting raped and he actually took a part in the rape.</p>

<p>He went to his father to get the truth. When his father kept referring to her as a whore, he shot him. And now he goes around, wondering, Where do the whores go? So that he could find Tysha again<sup><strong>1</strong></sup>.</p>

<h3>Shae</h3>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WVGeHm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/WVGeHm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Shae is another one. While some part of Tyrion always kept telling him that you fool, she is just a whore, he couldn't help but fall for her. </p>

<p>Shae was however only interested in his money. And as soon as Tyrion was arrested on charges of regicide, she went to the camp of the highest bidder, which was Cersei. On promises of a wealth and a good marriage, Shae provided a false testimony in the trial, incriminating both Tyrion and his wife Sansa. </p>

<p>Tyrion was hurt but he knew what she was and he demanded a trial by combat instead. </p>

<h3>Sansa</h3>

<p>Even though Tyrion thought the match was cruel, he agreed to it as he thought it was best to have Walls of Winterfell around him as he had Cersei for an enemy and his own power was dwindling day by day. Especially as Tywin made it clear to him that he would never let Tyrion inherit the Rock.</p>

<p>Tyrion discovered that he actually wanted Sansa, romantically. He wanted her to love him and he wanted to love her. But Sansa was always cold and distant. Tyrion thought if he was kind to her, she might come around. Everyone moves on, right? </p>

<p>That didn't happen. Sansa made it clear to Tyrion while she was willing to obey her Lord husband, she will never want a sexual relation with him out of her own will. That left a bitter taste in his mouth, further reaffirming his earlier conviction that he will never have someone who could love him for what he was. He told her as much, that that's why gods made whores for people like him. </p>

<h3>Penny</h3>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0icnGm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/0icnGm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Then there's case of Penny. Another lowborn dwarf girl. Tyrion thinks of her as both ugly and beautiful but by the time he met her, he was very much damaged goods. He was searching for Wherever the whores go, remember? The girl however was innocent and she began to like Tyrion.</p>

<p>Tyrion however failed to return the feelings as he didn't feel that way. But he was never cruel to her, he comforted her and rejected her advances by sympathetically lying that he was saving himself for his wife Sansa even though it's Tysha he is looking for. Lies we tell for love!</p>

<p>But then Shae came to haunt him. Young Penny expressed her sincere admiration for Tyrion, how he was brave. But that reminded him of Shae and her lies. Which enraged him. </p>

<p>Yet Tyrion doesn't hate her. He pities her rather, or feels sympathetic towards her. </p>

<p>Her raw innocent emotion and desire to find love reminds him of his own young self, when he was in love with Tysha. He doesn't want to crush that. </p>

<p>Penny is Tyrion's test. She is innocence, goodness and sincerity. Where as Tyrion now is hate, vengeance and indifference. </p>

<p>He doesn't want to break her heart but he can't find it in him to give her what she wants. He doesn't desire her sexually and he knows full well that she doesn't want him in a lustful way either, she's too innocent for lust yet.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Only time Tyrion was ever capable of loving someone was when he met Tysha. She was the only one and she has always been the one for him even though he kept telling himself otherwise for years until Jaime told him the truth. </p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Does Tyrion have such a low self-esteem?</strong></p>

<p>Yes he does. He has had a rather dim view of his worth ever since he was an ugly child in Casterly Rock. If not for his uncles, Aunt and brother, he probably would have ended his life a lot earlier. He let himself believe that he could be loved when he met Tysha but he was reminded by his father that its not true. He kept believing it till Jaime told him the truth. </p>

<p>His teenage, his youth are formed based on that experience. He had accepted that as his fate. If its his fate to be accepted only by whores, then so be it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Does he simply despise women of lower-classes?</strong></p>

<p>No he doesn't. His only true love is low-born, the one who still haunts him and is driving him mad. He is capable of kindness to them, as he showed kindness to Robert's whores and Penny. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>But why does he so quickly judge them guilty?</strong></p>

<p>Take it case by case.</p>

<p>In case of Tysha, he just had to look at himself. Why would a beautiful girl like her want to be with him? Jaime was kind to him always, it was not out of character for him to hire a whore to make a man out of him. And why would his father lie about it? If he didn't like the marriage, he could just say that. Why would he want to lie? Tyrion had no reason to suspect that it wasn't true and the lie actually made sense to him.</p>

<p>In case of Shae, a woman who on numerous occasions reminded you that she was a whore indeed, lied in court to get you condemned to death presumably on behest of your sister with promises of gold, is now lying naked in your father's bed who just had condemned you to death, calling him My Lion, what other proof do you need to judge her guilty? Did Cersei Threaten to kill her? If she had been threatened, she could just provide a simple testimony, why add the colorful description of their intimate relationship? Why tell about their personal things in the court? And why was she now so happily lying in Tyrion's father's bed? She never cared about him. </p>

<p>In case of Sansa, she again proved he was not someone who could be loved, no matter how hard he tried, no matter what he did, no matter how kind he was. He fought with a King for her honor, fought with his father for her chastity but she wouldn't ever consider letting him touch her, she wouldn't ever confide in him, she wouldn't ever consider him her life partner. And when he was arrested, she was first to fled, betraying her husband. But still Tyrion to defended her in the court as innocent.</p>

<p>In Case of Penny, he is damaged goods. He doesn't desire her. He doesn't want to tarnish her innocence either. But pities her, he sees himself in her but he doesn't love her. Nor does he hate her and would do what he can do to protect her. Goes without saying she is lower class. </p></li>

<p><sub><strong>1.</strong> There is a <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Sailor%27s_Wife/Theories"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fairly convincing theory</a> that Sailor's Wife, a whore in Braavos who only takes customers who marry her first, is Tysha. She has a 14 years old daughter named Lanna (Lanna is a Lannister/Westerlander name, feminine equivalent of Lann, founder of House Lannister) with long, fine golden hair, who could be Tyrion's daughter. So perhaps, there is some hope of a happy ending for Tyrion on that front. </sub></p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Team Jon decides to go north of the wall and capture a wight to show it to Team Cersei. They carry on with their plan and actually bring one to King's Landing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, in S06E10,</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Benjen said ""The Wall’s not just ice and stone, Ancient spells were carved into its foundation. Strong magic. To protect men from what lies beyond. And while it stands, the dead cannot pass. I cannot pass."". </p>
</blockquote>

<p>How could this plan even work?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","168474","<p>Jon answered it in Season 7 Episode 5, when they were planning the Wight expedition and someone questioned feasibility of the plan:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first wight I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond
  the Wall.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So from that precedence, he was certain they could do it again. The first wight mentioned here are the ones Jeor Mormont brought in Season 1. </p>

<p>This is inconsistent however. Show adapted book scenes for Season 1 but in Season 7 they are making their own story. Doubt it will happen that way in the books. </p>

<p>Anyways, a speculation can be, as long as a Night's Watch man accompanies a Wight, it can cross. But then the question is, Why did Benjen think he couldn't cross with Sam? </p>

<p>The spells on the Wall seem to be tied to spells on Three Eyed Raven's cave as pointed out by Edlothiad, so it is possible that Bran rendered them useless. But then again, Wights did cross the Wall in Season 1, Long before Night's King touched Bran.</p>

<p>Also they had a ship, so they could load the Wight on the ship and circumvent the Wall.</p>

<p>As it happened however, they had air-support when Dany answered Jon's call. But Jon didn't know she would come when he was planning so it could not have impacted his planning. </p>

"168488","Why was Aegon the first Dragonlord to conquer Westeros?","<p>Aegon the Conqueror manage to conquer six of the seven kingdoms, with just three dragons and a small army, with no more than 1600 men, according to this dialogue from <em>A Storm of Swords - Davos V</em> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Power?"" The king snorted. ""I have thirteen hundred men on Dragonstone, another three hundred at Storm's End."" His hand swept over the Painted Table. ""The rest of Westeros is in the hands of my foes. I have no fleet but Salladhor Saan's. No coin to hire sellswords. No prospect of plunder or glory to lure freeriders to my cause.""
  ""Lord husband,"" said Queen Selyse, ""you have more men than Aegon did three hundred years ago. All you lack are dragons.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He only failed to conquer Dorne because they used a guerilla-like strategy, making dragons useless.</p>

<p>But I wonder why Aegon was the first to conquer Westeros. The Valyrian Freehold extended pretty well in Essos, but never attempted to conquer Westeros. </p>

<p>Even if it was for political reasons (too busy with wars, would be too hard to administer, etc.), that does not prevent any Dragonlord conquering Westeros to make his own independent state.</p>

<p>So, why was Aegon the first to conquer Westeros with dragons, when others could have done it before?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","168511","<p>According to <em><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/The_World_of_Ice_%26_Fire"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The World of Ice &amp; Fire</a></em>, Valyrians only established an outpost in Westeros at the location that will be then called Dragonstone before the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Doom_of_Valyria"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Doom</a> hit them:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perhaps in preparation for their crossing of the narrow sea, <strong>the Valyrians also established their westernmost outpost on the isle that would come to be known as Dragonstone</strong> some two hundred years before the Doom.<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice &amp; Fire, <em>The Doom of Valyria</em> chapter</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apparently they were content to keep just this single stronghold without expandig further because their main interests were still in Essos:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Valyria felt its outpost was secured, and the dragonlords thus continued their schemes and intrigues on their native continent.</strong><br>
  And then, unexpected to all (save perhaps Aenar Targaryen and his maiden daughter Daenys the Dreamer), the Doom came to Valyria.<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice &amp; Fire, <em>The Doom of Valyria</em> chapter</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While they were busy with their plans for Essos, the Doom struck, killing all the dragonlords except the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Targaryens</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The dragonlords had been gathered in Valyria as was their wont... except for Aenar Targaryen, his children, and his dragons, who had fled to Dragonstone and so escaped the Doom</strong>.<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice &amp; Fire, <em>The Doom of Valyria</em> chapter</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Twelve years before the Doom of Valyria (114 BC), Aenar Targaryen</strong> sold his holdings in the Freehold and the Lands of the Long Summer and <strong>moved with all his wives, wealth, slaves, dragons, siblings, kin, and children to Dragonstone</strong>, a bleak island citadel beneath a smoking mountain in the narrow sea.<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice &amp; Fire, <em>The Reign of the Dragons: The Conquest</em> chapter</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Targaryens left Valyria before the Doom because of a vision of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daenys_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Aenar's daughter</a> of the imminent destruction of Valirya:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Targaryens were far from the most powerful of the dragonlords, and their rivals saw their flight to Dragonstone as an act of surrender, as cowardice. <strong>But Lord Aenar’s maiden daughter Daenys, known forever afterward as Daenys the Dreamer, had foreseen the destruction of Valyria by fire. And when the Doom came twelve years later, the Targaryens were the only dragonlords to survive.</strong><br>
  <sub>The World of Ice &amp; Fire, <em>The Reign of the Dragons: The Conquest</em> chapter</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even after the Doom, and until the reign of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon_I_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Aegon the Conqueror</a> more than a century after, Targaryens kept looking at Essos as their main sphere of interest:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Yet even so, <strong>for the best part of a hundred years after the Doom of Valyria (the rightly named Century of Blood), House Targaryen looked east, not west</strong>, and took little interest in the affairs of Westeros.<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice &amp; Fire, <em>The Reign of the Dragons: The Conquest</em> chapter</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As we have seen, Essos as the main priority for Targaryens was a habit rooted in a more general way on the whole Valyrian culture; more to the point of your question, there are a couple of speculations by <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Maesters"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Maesters</a> living after the Doom that had limited access to Valyrian texts that try to give an answer to this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Barth"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Septon Barth</a> speculated on the matter [of the contacts between Valyrians and the Westerlands], referring to a Valyrian text that has since been lost, <strong>suggesting that the Freehold's sorcerers foretold that the gold of Casterly Rock would destroy them.</strong> <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Perestan"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Archmaester Perestan</a> has put forward a different, more plausible speculation, <strong>suggesting that the Valyrians had in ancient days reached as far as Oldtown but suffered some great reverse or tragedy there that caused them to shun all of Westeros thereafter.</strong><br>
  <sub>The World of Ice &amp; Fire, <em>The Westerlands</em> chapter</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Summarizing, all of this basically explains mostly why were the Targaryens to conquer the Western continent, not why no one did it before, but I think that we can safely assume these things:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Valyrian_Freehold"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Valyrians</a> were most interested in the lands of Essos, where resided the most ancient and most refined civilizations (like Ancient Greece and Rome), instead of the rather uncivilized Westeros (comparable, I think, to the pre-feudal germanic kingdoms), that evidently was not a priority: they conquered a large part of the East, but only established a single stronghold in the West (Dragonstone).</li>
<li>Probably the Valyrians planned to conquer Westeros later, when they thought that their business in Essos was completed, but at some point the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Doom_of_Valyria"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Doom</a> occured, and they suddenly stopped to plan conquests. Or to do anything else.</li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aenar_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Aenar Targaryen</a> and his family were already on Dragonstone, so they escaped the Doom, but even then, the priority resided in the East (the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Century_of_Blood"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wars between the Free Cities</a> that suddenly were free from Valyrian rule).</li>
<li>When <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon_I_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Aegon Targaryen</a> finally took interest in the West, there were no other Valyrian Dragonlords that could beat him on this race to <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon%27s_Conquest"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">conquest</a> it: so it was extremely easy for him to be the first one.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Like I said, this mostly explain why Aegon was the first Dragonlord to conquer Westeros, not why nobody preceded him.</em></p>

<p>We also have two possible theories, that are in themselves just mere speculations, that try to answer why the conquer of Westeros was not a priority for Valyria:</p>

<ul>
<li>The most mythological one tells that they believed in a prophecy that viewed Westeros as the source of their future destruction.</li>
<li>Another most rational view was that they somehow encountered great difficulties in their exploration of Westeros that made them consider that it wasn't worth the effort.</li>
</ul>

<p>But it should be noted that this general indifference towards Westeros was not an strict rule or a self-imposed limitation for all Valyrians: we know that some minor families like the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Velaryon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Velaryon</a> and the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Celtigar"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Celtigar</a> (that were not Dragonlord families) had settled on Westeros, always near Dragonstone, even before the Targaryen's own flight from Valyria.</p>

<p>Back to your question </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, why was Aegon the first to conquer Westeros with dragons, when others could have done it before?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that the simplest and truest answer is that<br>
<strong>Others could have done it before, but no one actually did it because they were not interested, so he was the one to do it</strong>;<br>
or, in other words<br>
<strong>No one did it first because no one did it first</strong>.</p>

"168551","Did Mirri Maz Dur tell Dany she can't get pregnant in the show?","<p>Ok, there's a very well known part of the story in the books canon where <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Mirri_Maz_Duur"" rel=""noreferrer"">Mirri Maz Dur</a> tells <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daenerys_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Daenerys</a> that she is now barren, or at least that's how Dany interprets Mirri's line:</p>

<p>Now in the show, <em>Game of Thrones</em>, Dany tells Jon Snow (in the episode <em>The Dragon and the Wolf</em>) that she can't get pregnant, to which Jon says ""challenge accepted"".</p>

<p>The problem is that I don't recall Mirri actually saying the pregnant part to Dany on the show, so <strong>Did Mirri Maz Dur tell Dany she can't have children on the show?</strong> If so, when/where?</p>

<p>If not, then it's time for another question.</p>

  like leaves.” <strong>In the books, she adds one more line, the most crucial
  line in this fertility crisis: “When your womb quickens again, and you
  bear a living child.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Business Insider <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/game-of-thrones-is-daenerys-infertile-barren-mother-dragons-2017-8"" rel=""noreferrer"">also spotted the hole</a>:</p>

  like leaves.""</p>
  
  <p>However, <strong>""Game of Thrones"" omitted a significant portion of Duur's
  warning.</strong> Here's what she said in the books:</p>
  
  <p>When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east When the seas go

<p>It seems that Lyanna did not truly love Robert, and Rhaegar was not the evil man who Robert made him out to be.</p>

<p>In this two quotes:</p>

<p>Lyanna is mentioned to have loved the winter rose and it's a laurel of these Rhaegar leaves in her lap. This is suggestive in itself. Also, Dany in the house of the undying sees a vision in which a blue rose grows out of the wall. This is almost certainly Jon Snow.</p>

<p>I would conclude that Lyanna and Rhaegar are the most likely parents as of yet. Of course George could always write it to be something else but at this time the evidence is overwhelming. </p>

<p>After the Deadly Feast, she pulls off her mask and tells Frey's wife,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When people ask what happened here, tell them the North remembers. Tell them Winter came for House Frey.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then she walks out and <strong>nobody stops her</strong>.</p>

<p>Wouldn't the castle guards rush in to capture her? None of the handful of women standing around the feast hall rushed out to call for guards.</p>

<p>Wouldn't she have to get past dozens of guards? Guards at the entrance to the feast fall. Guards at the castle door. Guards at the castle walls and castle gate. Guards in the field. How could she get more than a mile without guards chasing after her?</p>

<p>How did she escape?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","168611","<p>Apart from the handful of female servants, who we have seen be mistreated by the Freys, all witnesses died of poisoning. The guards do not know they need to chase anyone and we do not see any of the servants move to alert them. </p>

<p>Even if the guards were alerted, Arya has faces, including the one she used to get close to Walder Frey in the first place. The Freys and their soldiers are routinely shown as being highly incompetent, so it does not seem likely that Arya would have trouble outsmarting them.</p>

<p>Having said all that, we don't really know how she got out as it wasn't shown. We just know she did escape. Perhaps she simply walked out with her own face and wasn't challenged.</p>

"168615","Is Jon Snow immune to fire?","<p>We've seen his aunt survive all fire and I even remember she almost enjoyed the scalding bath.</p>

<p>Jon was resurrected by the fire god. Is Jon now immune to fire, and just doesn't know it? </p>
","<game-of-thrones><jon-snow>","168616","<p>As far as the books go, GRRM has said that even Daenerys is not immune to fire and surviving the pyre was a one-time thing related to the dragons.</p>

<p>In the show, Daenerys appears to be permanently immune, however we actually see Jon burned by the lamp that he uses to burn the wight in the Lord Commander's quarters -</p>

<p>So it would appear that he is not immune to fire as Daenerys is.</p>

<p>Edit: As for being a fire wight, we don't know much about what abilities this potentially comes with. We do know that Beric Dondarrion uses blood to light his sword, as seen when he fights the Hound. This may be because he is a fire wight, or he may be using some sort of blood magic. </p>

<p>It could be easy to assume that a fire wight would have fire immunity - after all, the definition given by GRRM is ""a wight animated by fire,"" as opposed to ice. However this has not been confirmed in the show or in the books.</p>

<p>If being a fire wight does give you fire immunity, it could even be possible that Daenerys is a fire wight. After all, if she is not immune to fire because she is a Targaryen, why is she? This is all just speculation, so until they actually show Jon or Beric consumed by flame and left unscathed we really don't know.</p>

"168624","Did Lyanna Stark know about the sack of King's Landing and the death of Rhaegar's children?","<p>After reading this question: <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/168222/why-are-there-two-characters-named-aegon"">Why are there two characters named Aegon?</a> , it occurred to me that <strong>Lyanna Stark could have already known about her step children's deaths</strong> at the hand of the Mountain during the sack of King's Landing by Tywin Lannister and company.</p>

<p><strong>Using evidence from the books or the show, is it possible to establish a timeline of events that could allow for that possibility?</strong> <sup>1</sup></p>

<p><sub>1. Assuming that she did know about the death of the first-born son of Rhaegar Targaryan (also named Aegon Targaryan), it would adequately explain why she named her son Aegon as well in my mind...</sub></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit for clarity:</strong></p>

<p>I am aware of the FAegon story-line from the books, and it looks like that story-line has probably been dropped from the show (although who knows? Maybe Cercei's Golden Company will end up being led by FAegon in season 8... What a twist!). Even so, if there are book passages which lend credence to the theory that Lyanna Stark knew of the death of Rhaegar's children, that's more than good enough for me.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","168637","<p>We certainly know that since the fall of King's Landing, the siege of Storm's End was lifted by Ned Stark (evidence in following quote soon). Ned went to Storm's End after arguing with Robert Baratheon over the killing of Rhaegar's children. We can assume that news of the fall of King's Landing was flowing across the realm in the meantime (ravens, refugees, people, etc.). Certainly the new King would be informing Lords at castles, either to celebrate victory, or demand the bending of the knee.</p>
<p>The Tower of Joy is near Nightsong and Kingsgrave. Kingsgrave is the seat of House Manwoody. Nightsong is the seat of House Caron. Castles such as this would be the source of supplies, and news. As long as we assume the airspeed velocity of a laden raven is greater than that an army (or a band of 7 people on horseback), it is certainly possible for news to have reached the Tower of Joy with the events of King's Landing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I looked for you on the Trident,” Ned said to them.</p>
<p>“We were not there,” Ser Gerold answered.</p>
<p>“Woe to the Usurper if we had been,” added Ser Oswell.</p>
<p>“When King’s Landing fell, Ser Jaime slew your king with a golden sword, and I wondered where you were.”</p>
<p>“Far away,” Ser Gerold said, “or Aerys would yet sit the Iron Throne, and our false brother would burn in seven hells.”</p>
<p>“I came down on Storm’s End to lift the siege,” Ned told them, “and the Lords Tyrell and Redwyne dipped their banners, and all their knights bent the knee to pledge us fealty. I was certain you would be among them.”</p>
<p>”Our knees do not bend easily,” said Ser Arthur Dayne.</p>
<p>“Ser Willem Darry is fled to Dragonstone with your queen and Prince Viserys. I thought you might have sailed with him.”</p>
<p>“Ser Willem is a good man, and true,” said Ser Oswell.</p>
<p>“But not of the Kingsguard,” Ser Gerold pointed out. “The Kingsguard does not flee.”</p>
<p>“Then, or now,” said Ser Arthur. He donned his helm.</p>
<p>”We swore a vow,” explained old Ser Gerold.</p>
<p>Ned’s wraiths moved up beside him, shadow swords in their hands. They were seven against three. “And now it begins,” said Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. He unsheathed Dawn and held it with both hands. The blade was pale as milkglass, alive with light.</p>
<p>“No,” said Ned with sadness in his voice. “Now it ends.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Kingsguard are clearly aware of the fall of King's Landing. Although to be fair, they only respond of that knowledge after Ned Stark's first comment regarding King's Landing's fall, and Jaime Lannister's betrayal. They don't betray any knowledge aside from that already mentioned by Ned Stark. So as far as actual proof whether Lyanna Stark knew of the specific events of Aegon's fate, is unclear.</p>
<p>That said, there is also no book evidence that Lyanna Stark named her son Aegon, or would have in any way done something with the knowledge of the death of Aegon Targaryen in King's Landing. It is entirely possible that a show writer figured Aegon was a cool name, and a cool reference to the removed storyline of Aegon Targaryen in the books, without thinking of the implications.</p>

<p>There is not a doubt that Arthur was considered to be the best swordsman of at least the past 100 years, if not ever.</p>
<p>From The World of Ice and Fire:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At five-and-ten, Ser Jaime Lannister was already a knight—an honor he had received from the hand of Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, <strong>whom many considered to be the realm’s most chivalrous warrior</strong>.<br /><sub>-<em>The World of Ice and Fire</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prince Rhaegar’s support came from the younger men at court, including Lord Jon Connington, Ser Myles Mooton of Maidenpool, and Ser Richard Lonmouth. The Dornishmen who had come to court with the Princess Elia were in the prince’s confidence as well, particularly Prince Lewyn Martell, Elia’s uncle and a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard. <strong>But the most formidable of all Rhaegar’s friends and allies in King’s Landing was surely Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning</strong>.<br />
<sub>-<em>The World of Ice and Fire</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the Swords of the Morning are all famous throughout the Seven Kingdoms. There are boys who secretly dream of being a son of Starfall so they might claim that storied sword and its title. Most famous of all was Ser Arthur Dayne, the deadliest of King Aerys II's Kingsguard.<br />
<sub>-<em>The World of Ice and Fire</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even Jaime Lannister remarks at Arthur's reputation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>when Ser Arthur Dayne broke the Kingswood Brotherhood. He had saved Lord Sumner's life as Big Belly Ben was about to smash his head in, though the outlaw had escaped him. And he'd held his own against the Smiling Knight, though it was Ser Arthur who slew him. What a fight that was, and what a foe. The Smiling Knight was a madman, cruelty and chivalry all jumbled up together, but he did not know the meaning of fear. And Dayne, with Dawn in hand . . . The outlaw's longsword had so many notches by the end that Ser Arthur had stopped to let him fetch a new one. &quot;It's that white sword of yours I want,&quot; the robber knight told him as they resumed, though he was bleeding from a dozen wounds by then. &quot;Then you shall have it, ser,&quot; the Sword of the Morning replied, and made an end of it.<br />

</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I learned from the White Bull and Barristan the Bold,&quot; Jaime snapped. &quot;I learned from Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, who could have slain all five of you<sup>1</sup> with his left hand while he was taking with a piss with the right<sup>2.</sup>.<br />

<p>Listen, if you don't believe me, or Jaime, or Archmaester Yandel, then believe the words of our mate, Ned Stark:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Bran]:&quot;Was there one who was best of all?&quot;<br />
[Ned]: &quot;The finest knight I ever saw was Ser Arthur Dayne, who fought with a blade called Dawn, forged from the heart of a fallen star. They called him the Sword of the Morning, and he would have killed me [at the Tower of Joy] but for Howland Reed.&quot;.<br />

</blockquote>
<hr />
A Caveat on being the 'best': George R. R. Martin is intelligent enough to realise that there is no real 'best' swordsman, or at least not one that is the best by far. So here, we're only talking about reputation. In fact, he goes on to say:
<blockquote>
<p>[Interviewer]: Who would win in a fight, Barristan Selmy or Arthur Dayne (in their best days)?<br />
[Martin]: Dayne... if he was armed with Dawn.<br />
If both men had equivalent weaponry, it might be a toss-up.<br />
-So Spake Martin: <em><a href=""https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/The_Sword_of_the_Morning_vs._Barristan_the_Bold"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">THE SWORD OF THE MORNING VS. BARRISTAN THE BOLD</a></em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that also informs of the importance of the tools that the swordsman uses, Arthur had the advantage of having literally the best sword in all of Westeros, <strong><a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dawn"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dawn</a></strong>.

<p>&quot;I was just . . . remembering.&quot; Her throat was dry. <strong>&quot;You are a good friend, Taena. I have not had a true friend in . . .&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Well, he has a strong wife. It was a pity Taena could not serve as Hand. She was thrice the man her husband was, and far more amusing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Throughout <em>A Feast for Crows</em> Taena serves as Cersei's close ally, confidant, and even informant. Cersei considers her to be the only person she can truly trust and rely upon. This is particularly remarkable given that Cersei knows that Taena is spying on her for Lady Margery Tyrell--a situation that Cersei not only allows to continue, but tries to twist to her advantage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If you know she is a spy, why take her on?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Margaery is not half so clever as she thinks. She has no notion what a sweet serpent she has in that Myrish slut. I use Taena to feed the little queen what I want her to know. Some of it is even true.&quot; Cersei's eyes were bright with mischief. &quot;And Taena tells me everything Maid Margaery is doing.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At one point Cersei even makes sexual advances upon her, but despite Taena's apparent willingness to &quot;serve her Queen&quot; this aspect of their relationship is limited to a single night.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was still no good.</p>
<p>It had never been any good with anyone but Jaime.</p>
<p>When she tried to take her hand away, Taena caught it and kissed her fingers. &quot;Sweet queen, how shall I pleasure you?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally I believe their &quot;friendship&quot; was very one-sided, with Taena in fact expertly <em>manipulating</em> her way into Cersei's good graces. We have no idea how she really feels about her Queen, considering how abysmal a judge of character Cersei proves herself to be. Taena has yet to reappear in the books following her flight from King's Landing during Cersei's imprisonment by the Faith.</p>

"168645","Why didn't Tyrion have Littlefinger arrested?","<p>Lord Petyr Baelish tells Catelyn Stark that the Valyrian steel dagger is Tyrion's, thus getting him arrested. I don't think Tyrion Lannister would have really appreciated his little journey to the Vale. So, why did he do nothing against Littlefinger once he returned to King's Landing?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","168647","<p><strong>Short answer : he wanted to but he couldn't</strong></p>

<p><strong>Long answer :</strong></p>

<p>Petyr Baelish was quite powerful in King's Landing, and once Tyrion got more influence, Littlefinger became Lord of Harrenhal and went to the Vale, so too powerful and too far from the influence of Tyrion.</p>

<p>He really didn't appreciate his journey in the Vale, but didn't know how to confront Littlefinger : </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Indeed."" Jowly, balding Janos Slynt looked rather like a frog, a smug frog who had gotten rather above himself. ""We have sore need of you, my lord. Rebellion everywhere, this grim omen in the sky, rioting in the city streets . . ."" <br>
  ""And whose fault is that, Lord Janos?"" Cersei lashed out. ""Your gold cloaks are charged with keeping order. As to you, Tyrion, you could better serve us on the field of battle.""<br>
  He laughed. ""No, I'm done with fields of battle, thank you. I sit a chair better than a horse, and I'd sooner hold a wine goblet than a battle-axe. All that about the thunder of the drums, sunlight flashing on armor, magnificent destriers snorting and prancing? Well, the drums gave me headaches, the sunlight flashing on my armor cooked me up like a harvest day goose, and those magnificent destriers shit everywhere. Not that I am complaining. Compared to the hospitality I enjoyed in the Vale of Arryn, drums, horseshit, and fly bites are my favorite things.""<br>
  Littlefinger laughed. ""Well said, Lannister. A man after my own heart.""<br>
  Tyrion smiled at him, remembering a certain dagger with a dragonbone hilt and a Valyrian steel blade. We must have a talk about that, and soon. He wondered if Lord Petyr would find that subject amusing as well. <br /><sub>-<em>A Clash of Kings - Tyrion I</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later, both have an interesting dialogue</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""That's a handsome knife as well.""
  ""Is it?"" There was mischief in Littlefinger's eyes. He drew the knife and glanced at it casually, as if he had never seen it before. ""Valyrian steel, and a dragonbone hilt. A trifle plain, though. It's yours, if you would like it.""
  ""Mine?"" Tyrion gave him a long look. ""No. I think not. Never mine."" He knows, the insolent wretch. He knows and he knows that I know, and he thinks that I cannot touch him.. <br /><sub>-<em>A Clash of Kings - Tyrion IV</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, this quote resumes Tyrion's thought about harming Littlefinger</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No one had ever thought to question the appointments, and why should they? Littlefinger was no threat to anyone. A clever, smiling, genial man, everyone's friend, always able to find whatever gold the king or his Hand required, and yet of such undistinguished birth, one step up from a hedge knight, he was not a man to fear. He had no banners to call, no army of retainers, no great stronghold, no holdings to speak of, no prospects of a great marriage.
  But do I dare touch him? Tyrion wondered. Even if he is a traitor? He was not at all certain he could, least of all now, while the war raged. Given time, he could replace Littlefinger's men with his own in key positions, but . . . <br /><sub>-<em>A Clash of Kings - Tyrion IV</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keep in mind that Tyrion was not powerful in King's Landing, and they are preparing for war against Stannis : Littlefinger even leaves King's Landing o negotiate a Lannister-Tyrell alliance, and returns only for the battle of the Blackwater. Tyrion was injured in the battle, and he takes few weeks to recover. After that, Littlefinger becomes Lord of Harrenhal, and goes to the Vale, where Tyrion could do nothing to Littlefinger.</p>

<p>To summarize: </p>

<ul>
<li>He understands that Littlefinger is much more powerful and dangerous than he thought</li>
<li>He decides to replace Littlefinger's men with his own men, a strategy for the long term</li>
<li>They don't spend a lot of time together in King's Landing</li>
<li>Petyr is out of reach of Tyrion's power before Tyrion got enough power to do anything</li>
</ul>

(and why would they have ravens that are primed to some minor castle in, say, the Reach?)</p>

<p>Instead, he sends a raven to the central information hub, the Citadel of Oldtown, in the hope that they will distribute the message to all maesters, and thus all lords, in the realm. They also have much more authority in this question then he has. To the southern lords, he is just another rebel king in the North and they probably would not believe him about such an outrageous claim.</p>

<p>Additionally, he tries to convince the two queens, which would have much more effect than him asking the minor lords personally as well. The lords are bound by their oaths to fight for their respective queen, so they can't just abandon them in the middle of that war to fight in the North, or they'd be traitors - unless the queen gives that order herself.</p>

"238508","Did Lyanna Stark ever love Robert Baratheon?","<p>At the time of the famed tourney of Harrenhall, Lady Lyanna Stark was betrothed to Eddard Stark's best friend, Lord Robert Baratheon, while Prince Rhaegar Targaryen was married to Princess Elia Martell of Dorne. Rhaegar eventually won the tourney and the right to name the tourney's queen of love and beauty. Tradition required him to name his wife to the title, but instead he gave the title to Lyanna Stark causing a great scandal. Sometime later Lyanna is spirited away by Rhaegar, an event that would eventually spark the Baratheon/Stark rebellion against the Targaryens.</p>
<p>It is heavily hinted by several characters that Rhaegar and Lyanna shared a mutual attraction, and that the two of them eventually eloped.</p>
<p>Lyanna Stark could have been betrothed by her father, Rickard Stark, to Robert Baratheon <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/169133/did-lyannas-consent-even-matter"">against her wishes</a> and then rebelled against her father's decision by choosing a man more to her liking. Or maybe she was attracted to Robert Baratheon, but then switched allegiance to Rhaegar Targaryen.</p>
<p><strong>Did Lyanna Stark ever love (or was attracted to or even interested in) Robert Baratheon?</strong></p>
<p>Please provide answers from the books, but if the books don't answer that, I would accept answers based on the TV series.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","238510","<p><strong>Probably Not.</strong></p>
<p>We do not hear much of Lyanna's side of things because... well... she is dead. Most of the information we get about her is from Robert or Ned. Obviously Robert is not a reliable source of information and Ned is haunted by the promise he made to her.</p>
<p>The only insight we have is one of Ned's memories when he is tracking down Robert's bastards...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Robert will never keep to one bed,&quot; Lyanna had told him at Winterfell, on the night long ago when their father had promised her hand to the young Lord of Storm's End. &quot;I hear he has gotten a child on some girl in the Vale.&quot; Ned had held the babe in his arms; he could scarcely deny her, nor would he lie to his sister, but he had assured her that what Robert did before their betrothal was of no matter, that he was a good man and true who would love her with all his heart. Lyanna had only smiled. &quot;Love is sweet, dearest Ned, but it cannot change a man's nature.&quot;</p>
<p><sup>A Game of Thrones - Eddard IX</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now it is technically possible that Lyanna did love Robert and was just concerned that he would stop or loving her or that even if he did love her she could not appease his sexual appetite.</p>
<p>However, I highly doubt this. Lyanna is described as fierce and strong natured. I doubt she could love a man who would not be fully devoted to her.</p>

<p>Wouldn't it be more profitable if the three (Sansa, Arya, Bran) considered this character guilty on their own (in private), and order Arya to execute him and at the same time take his face?</p>

<p>SANSA: How do you answer these charges, Lord Baelish?</p>
<p><em>Littlefinger stiffens, as everyone in the room looks at him.</em></p>

<hr />
<p>By doing it in trial they expose Littlefinger for who he was to everyone, not just those who already knew it. Though to be fair most people already knew and those that didn't were told before the trial as per the official script.</p>
<p>What can they gain from doing it in secret?</p>
<ul>
<li>Vale? They already have its support with or without Littlefinger due to being cousins. Lord Royce seems to support the Starks and with Littlefinger gone he will most likely become Lord protector until Robin comes of age.</li>
<li>Littlefinger's contacts? How will they know now? After someone dies you don't magically learn everything about them.</li>
<li>Influence? They are already the ruling family in the North and essentially the Vale, what other influence do they need?</li>
</ul>
<p>What can they lose from doing it in secret? Trust, power, support, etc.</p>
<p>Another good point raised by @Odin1806 is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition they also show that the Starks are a unified front once again. While some may have believed (and rightly so) that the house Stark was in shambles holding a trial and making everything public shows that the Starks are all home, they are back on top, and they are not to be trifled with.</p>

<p>As to why Arya didn't take Lord Baelish's face, well we don't know if she did or not. For all we know her and Sansa are having a lot of fun with it.</p>

<p>This answer uses an out of universe information about how trial by combat works, but I think it may give some idea.</p>

<p>Trial by combat is a way to determine the guilt, not if the accused can walk free even if he was guilty.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_by_combat"" rel=""noreferrer"">Trial by combat</a> was a method to settle accusations in the absence of witnesses or a confession in which two parties in dispute fought in single combat; the winner of the fight was proclaimed to be right. In essence, it was a judicially sanctioned duel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we applied this to the show, we'll see it matches. </p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>In both Tyrion's trials, no one knew for sure if he was guilty or not, so he was able to demand it.</li>
</ul>

<p>In other cases when there was enough evidence:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Jon executing Ser Alliser: Ser Alliser Thorne couldn't because the ruler (Jon) was certain of his guilt. </p></li>
<li><p>The same when Rob executed Rickard Karstark. </p></li>
<li><p>The same when Ned sentenced The Mountain to death, he listened to the villager testimony and because he believed it, he passed the sentence.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Someone like The Mountain can't just go around killing people then demand a trial by combat every time, as long there are witnesses, confession or a way to make the ruler certain of the guilt, he'll pass the sentence and the accused can't demand a trial by combat.</p>

<p>The ruler in this case was Sansa, if she witnessed the crime herself, or believed Bran, she can just pass the sentence.</p>

","<game-of-thrones>","168741","<p>Source: <a href=""https://www.quora.com/How-can-Jon-Snow-be-a-Targaryen-if-he-burnt-his-hand-in-the-book-Game-of-Thrones-while-saving-the-commander-from-the-white-walker"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Quora</a></p>

<p>Targaryens are not immune to fire. What happened to Daenerys on the funeral pyre was a one-time event (or rather two-time - recall episode 4 of season 6), according to the author, who's discussed it at fan events. So Daenerys herself isn't immune to fire either (and the thing with the eggs, where she isn't burned, IS NOT in the books). Plenty of Targaryens have been killed because of fire or extreme heat: Viserys, Aerion Brightflame who drank wildfire, Aegon V and his son Prince Duncan who died in a fire at Summerhall, and Rhaenyra Targaryen who was fed to her brother's dragon. So it's not that Viserys should have been fireproof, it's that NO Targ is inherently fireproof.</p>

"32526","Is archery underestimated in the wars of a Song of Ice and Fire","<p>It seems to me that archery is very underestimated in Westeros and Essos in the tactics/strategy point of view.</p>

<p>Below are ALL the references I remember of the mentions of marksmanship:</p>

<ul>
<li>Bran and Arya training archery in Game of Thrones</li>
<li>Theon says (to Bran I think) the ironmen are skilled archers (and lovers)</li>
<li>Some countrymen and rebels seems to use bow and arrow, or sometimes crossbow (in the travels of Arya and Jaime)</li>
<li>I think I read somewhere the Kingswood Brotherhood user bows, here rebels again</li>
<li>The summer islanders are mentioned to have pretty good longbows for distance</li>
<li>Jon and the black brothers at the wall use some archers on the to defend against the wildlings</li>
</ul>

<p>I thinks among the five books that's all I can remember, still it is very little use in war and tactics, the guards who escort the highborn characters never use bows, the kingsguard has no archers, archers are not mentioned in Blackwater battle, or among the mercenary companies, nor even on the raids by Victarion/Ironmen, whose kin are supposed good at archery...</p>

<p>Am I missing or overseeing it? Is it a fact archery are little used in Westeros and Essos?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><game-of-thrones>","32527","<p>Archery was actually rather undervalued in our real history, particularly in medieval Europe, so it isn't terribly surprising for it to be undervalued in the relatively close parallels of Westeros, which was deliberately based in many ways on medieval Europe.</p>

<p>In the feudal systems of Europe, knights, the backbone of medieval armies, were the elite nobility who could afford heavy armor and good steel weapons.</p>

<p>Archery was relegated to low paid professional soldiers or peasant conscripts for centuries.  Many knights disdained archery as ""beneath their station"" or ""unchivalric"".</p>

<p>It wasn't until relatively late in the history of feudal Europe that longbows became recognized as an important strategic asset in warfare.  </p>

<p>One of the most famous early battles where longbows featured heavily was the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Agincourt"" rel=""noreferrer"">Battle of Agincourt</a>.  During the battle, the English forces were outnumbered somewhere between 4-3 and 6-1.  However, the vast majority of the English forces (5/6th of the total troops) were archer units.</p>

<p>This was seen by many as a crippling shortcoming at the time, as evaluations of comparative strength were frequently based on the number of armed knights on either side.</p>

<p>In fact, one account overestimated the already severe imbalance of troop ratios up to ""ten French nobles against one English"", dismissing the archers altogether.</p>

<p>Yet the archers were incredibly decisive during that battle, resulting in thousands of deaths and prisoners on the French side, and scant hundreds of English casualties (possibly as few as 113).</p>

<p>One of the problems with archery in feudal society was that the relatively heavy armor used by the knighted nobility required use of heavy longbows in order for archery to be effective in piercing the targets.</p>

<p>Archers required <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_longbow#Training"" rel=""noreferrer"">extensive training</a> in order for these heavy war longbows to become effective in warfare scenarios.  </p>

<p>Given this, it makes sense that most of the use of bows you list involve targets who are primarily unarmored (wildlings, victims of the Ironborn raids), or are used by those who may not be able to afford steel (countrymen and rebels) or who employ hit-and-run tactics (rebels).</p>

<p>Bran and Arya, and other members of the high nobility, likely trained primarily for hunting and for tournaments (although knowing Ned Stark, it is entirely possible he wanted them proficient for more practical reasons).</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.</em> - Cersei Lannister</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why does Cersei call it <em>Game of Thrones</em> (and why did G.R.R. Martin name it that way)?</p>

<p>In my understanding of the books and the TV show, multiple characters, families and houses play <em>multiple</em> games (mustering, battling, intrigues etc.) to be seated on <em>the</em> Iron Throne. </p>

<p><a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/127794"">This question about the titles of the book</a> also noted that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A Game of Thrones refers to the eponymous ""game"" of politics and treason characters play to claim the iron throne and the power that comes with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But then, the throne should be singular because it refers to the game to claim the Iron Throne, and not multiple Thrones.</p>

<p>Therefore, wouldn't it make more sense to call it <em>Games of Throne</em>?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><title-explanation>","168857","<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> It is meant in the metaphorical sense to gain more power.</p>
<p>Not all thrones are the physical one, the Iron Throne. It is meant in a metaphorical sense i.e. &quot;The way you act to gain more power&quot; but that doesn't quite have the same ring to it.</p>
<p>Think of it like Lord Baelish would:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Ladder</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each rung is more power and another metaphorical throne you've won in the game to get more power.</p>
<p>Take another example, The Warden of the North isn't technically a throne but it is a position of major power in the Game of Thrones world. The position is thought over by the Stark's and Bolton's and lately Littlefinger though we eventually see the Stark's prevail, for now.</p>
<hr />
<p>I did find this <a href=""https://english.stackexchange.com/a/63139"">English SE answer</a> that appears to have the same theory as me on the language behind the name. (Emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think part of the confusion is: if there is only one Iron Throne (as there is in the series), why is &quot;thrones&quot; plural in A Game of Thrones. The answer is that &quot;A Game of Throne&quot;, &quot;A Game of a Throne&quot;, and &quot;A Game of the Throne&quot; all sound really terrible to native English speakers.</p>
<p>Here you should interpret &quot;thrones&quot; as a generic noun, <strong>meaning thrones as an abstract concept rather than referring to any particular one</strong>. In English, if you have a countable noun, the generic must be expressed as plural (with no article). Possibly, the translation into Czech should have been a game in which one might win the (only) throne, if that phrase can be expressed reasonably succinctly in Czech.</p>

"168864","What is going on at Wall fortifications other than Castle Black?","<p>I've only seen the TV series, but it seems that even though Night's Watch has got multiple castles situated on and near the wall and there might be patrols going between them on the wall, Castle Black is the only Night's Watch's location that is shown there. Did I miss any coverage of other Night's Watch's fortifications? Is there any action happening in the books?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","168866","<p>There were originally 19 castles or fortifications on the wall<sup>1</sup>, however as numbers waned the Night's Watch became fewer and fewer. This left just Three Castles manned. <em>Castle Black</em>, which you mentioned is located towards the centre of the wall and is effectively Night's Watch HQ. The other two are <em>Eastwatch-by-the-Sea</em> and <em>The Shadow Tower</em>.</p>
<p>Let's start with the easier of the two.</p>
<h2>The Shadow Tower</h2>
<h3>Game of Thrones</h3>
<p>The Shadow Tower got only few mentions in the series. It first made an appearance when Qhorin Halfhand and some other Rangers joined Jon Snow in scouting out the Wildling Army. Qhorin, Stonesnake, Borba and Harker all died in that scouting after Jon was taken.</p>
<p>It's second appearance was after the death of the Old Bear, when the Commander of The Shadow Tower, Denys Mallister came to the elections of the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. Although he was experienced, he ended up losing to Jon Snow.</p>
<h3>A Song of Ice and Fire</h3>
<p>Qhorin Halfhand leads a ranging from the Shadow Tower in <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, he is however unsuccessful in finding Benjen Stark, First Ranger of the Night's Watch. In the book series, Jeor Mormont considers repopulating Stonedoor with men from the Shadow Tower. Another difference is that the Rangers with Qhorin during the scouting that die are Ebben, Dalbridge and Stonesnake. The men from the Shadow Tower travelling to Castle Black pick up Sam and Gilly en-route, taking them to Castle Black. Regular raids are also discussed at the Shadow Tower.</p>
<h2>Eastwatch-by-the-Sea</h2>
<h3>Game of Thrones</h3>
<p>Eastwatch made a bigger appearance in Season 7, after the Fellowship of the Wights met there to make there ranging into the North. This is where Jon and co. met before they went North to capture a wight and bring it South. It was also the castle destroyed by the Night King. In Season 7 Tormund and his wildlings manned Eastwatch.</p>
<p>It had minor mentions before Season 7, such as Tywin send Janos Slynt there, and Stannis advising Jon to send Alliser Thorne there, Jon however ends up deciding he wants to keep Alliser close.</p>
<h3>A Song of Ice and Fire</h3>
<p>Like at the Shadow Tower, Jeor Mormont considers repopulating Long Barrow with men from Eastwatch, Alliser Thorne is also made Master-at-arms at Eastwatch. Stannis lands at Eastwatch to save Castle Black, and Sam and Gilly set off from Eastwatch with Maester Aemon.</p>
<p>Cotter Pyke takes 11 ships to save the people at Hardhome on a rescue mission. The Giants trying to cross the wall with their mammoths are also sent East to round the wall at Eastwatch as the mammoths are too large to cross the wall.</p>
<p>So although they're very minor, they did have mentions.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> From West to East they are as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Westwatch-by-the-Bridge</li>
<li>The Shadow Tower, commanded by Ser Denys Mallister</li>
<li>Sentinel Stand</li>
<li>Greyguard (mentioned in show)</li>
<li>Stonedoor</li>
<li>Hoarfrost Hill</li>
<li>Icemark</li>
<li>The Nightfort (mentioned in show)</li>
<li>Deep Lake (mentioned in show)</li>
<li>Queensgate</li>
<li>Castle Black, commanded by the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch</li>
<li>Oakenshield</li>
<li>Woodswatch-by-the-Pool</li>
<li>Sable Hall</li>
<li>Rimegate</li>

<p>The title says it all, really.</p>

<p>We see that the Night's Watch has to vote to elect a new Lord Commander, but in the show we see (I think?) only those stationed in Castle Black having the possibility to vote.</p>

<p>Is that really the case? Even when all castles were manned?</p>

<p>This also takes into account people who are absent from the voting, even if they are still at Castle Black, as they can't afford to have no one manning the Wall.</p>

"168885","What are the limits of Brandon Stark's greensight abilities?","<p>Is there any suggestions or evidence of limits to Brandon Stark's greensight abilities scrolling back and forward in time and 'jumping' in space in the TV series?</p>

<p>Can he, for example as the newly appointed Three Eyed Raven, witness past and future events such as the doom of Valyria or uncover the secrets of creation or see the outcome of a war?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","168904","<h1>He seems to be limited to the near past</h1>
<p>As far as we've seen, without the Three-eyed Raven, Bran has been able to Warg as he wants, but has never mentioned anything further back than Lyanna's wedding (if I remember correctly). However with the fully &quot;trained&quot; Three-eyed Raven, they were able to go all the way back to the Age of Heroes (to witness the creation of the first White Walker).</p>
<p>One thing that we need to notice is the more recent ones Bran has done without the presence of a Weirwood right next to him. The travels with the Three-eyed raven, and others on his way south, always took place next to a Weirwood. It would seem in the show canon, up until late in season 7, he wasn't shown being able do any form of greensight/time travel without a Weirwood. This trend is broken when he is sat in his room and sees the wedding between Lyanna and Rhaegar after Sam mentions it.</p>
<p>Another &quot;missing Weirwood&quot; is in the memories he's visiting. At the Tower of Joy, although Bran might be by a Weirwood in the present, there's no distinct Weirwoods in the Tower of Joy scene and I believe in the book canon there are no Weirwood trees that far south (in Dorne). Furthermore, in the Throne Room, there is again no Weirwood, yet Bran was able to witness Petyr talk about ladders and their chaos.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it seems at the height of his power, the Three-eyed Raven is unlimited by how far he can travel back, however as far as we know requires a Weirwood to see the distant past, both in the present and in the past. The nearer past Bran seems to be able to see regardless of proximity to a Weirwood (such as Petyr's scheming and the Tower of Joy scenes).</p>

"168929","How did Sansa and Theon survive the jump?","<p>We could see that Theon Greyjoy helped Sansa Stark escape from Winterfell which was under Ramsay's control by jumping off the wall. The outer wall is said to be about 80 feet high. How did both of them survive jumping from that height? It is highly unlikely to survive that jump even if there was snow.</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","168940","<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Characters survive their falls from heights due to plot armour.</p>

<hr>

<p>Looking back over the scene it isn't clear at all how they actually survive the jump. The snow at the bottom of the wall doesn't actually look that deep and you never see them land. The following image is of the look down the wall to the ground before they jump:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/826b8.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/826b8.png"" alt=""View from the top of the wall""></a></p>

<p>The snow also looks quite compact. The two could have injuries but ignore them due to adrenaline taking over. Here's the scene for reference:</p>

<p><div class=""youtube-embed""><div>
                <iframe width=""640px"" height=""395px"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/fdxVX1RRKO0?start=0""></iframe>
            </div></div></p>

<p>Note that in the above scene Theon pushes Myranda from the wall that is less high and has no snow and she is killed on impact. Though she doesn't land feet first but on her side/back.</p>

<p>We next see them in Season 6 Episode 1 with them both still hurriedly running through the snow and it doesn't look much more than ankle deep at best.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/V2Sbm.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/V2Sbm.jpg"" alt=""Sansa and Theon in the snow""></a></p>

<p>Obviously they are further away from Winterfell so the snow won't be exactly the same but they're still hurrying and looking worried so they can't be too far away.</p>

<p>Here's the scene of them running through the forests:</p>

<p><div class=""youtube-embed""><div>
                <iframe width=""640px"" height=""395px"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/rN_qdyJfUq4?start=0""></iframe>
            </div></div></p>

<p>The snow at Winterfell below the walls will be deeper as snow collects at walls so should help soften the impact.</p>

<p>So it appears they could survive the fall with the snow cushioning it but the amount of snow needed doesn't seem to tally up with what we see on screen.</p>

<p>All the way back in Season 1 Episode 1 we see Bran fall from a tower, of taller height, straight onto his back after being pushed by Jaime.</p>

<p><div class=""youtube-embed""><div>

            </div></div></p>

<p>He is paralysed and put into a coma by this fall but does survive it. So it appears it is possible. Credit to @Flater for this point.</p>

<p>Another character that dies from his fall is Tommen Baratheon though he appears to fall from a much taller height.</p>

<p>From the books the perspective is a little differently. Though in the show the snow doesn't appear to be forty feet high at all.</p>

"168953","Do the women of westeros change their surnames upon marriage?","<p>I think not, but I may be mistaken. I've seen Ned's wife, Catelin being called Catelyn Tully several times.</p>

<p>What is the custom in Westeros, of married noblewomen surnames? Do they change, or not?</p>

<p>Example: when Sansa was forced to marry (twice), did she became Sansa Lannister or Sansa Bolton? Or did she remain Sansa Stark?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","168954","<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> It appears that woman do change their names upon marriage though there are some caveats.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure this won't be answered from the show so I'll use the books.</p>

<p>Catelyn Stark is referred to as Catelyn Stark at least once in the books, after a very brief search and it is in her own POV chapter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Catelyn Stark</strong> stared at the eunuch in stunned disbelief. He was a spider, she thought wildly, an enchanter or worse. He knew things no one could possibly know, unless … ""What have you done to Ser Rodrik?"" she demanded.
  <br><sup>A Game of Thrones - Catelyn IV</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it would appear that woman do change their names upon marriage just like in our world.</p>

<p>However, Jon appears to call her by both names from his POV chapter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Something cold moved in her eyes. ""I told you to leave,"" she said. ""We don't want you here.""
  Once that would have sent him running. Once that might even have made him cry. Now it only made him angry. He would be a Sworn Brother of the Night's Watch soon, and face worse dangers than <strong>Catelyn Tully Stark</strong>. ""He's my brother,"" he said.
  <br><sup>A Game of Thrones - Jon II</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Littlefinger also calls her Tully but he wants her for his own and so probably does it to try and weaken her marriage to Ned in his own eyes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Just what it appears,"" Littlefinger said, easing himself onto a window seat. ""A brothel. Can you think of a less likely place to find a <strong>Catelyn Tully</strong>?"" He smiled. ""As it chances, I own this particular establishment, so arrangements were easily made. I am most anxious to keep the Lannisters from learning that Cat is here in King's Landing.""
  <br><sup>A Game of Thrones - Eddard IV</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also note this quote from the books which seems to imply that she has changed her name:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""<strong>Lady … Stark?</strong>"" Masha Heddle said thickly.
  <br>""<strong>I was still Catelyn Tully</strong> the last time I bedded here,"" she told the innkeep. She could hear the muttering, feel the eyes upon her. Catelyn glanced around the room, at the faces of the knights and sworn swords, and took a deep breath to slow the frantic beating of her heart. Did she dare take the risk? There was no time to think it through, only the moment and the sound of her own voice ringing in her ears. ""You in the corner,"" she said to an older man she had not noticed until now. ""Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your surcoat, ser?""
  <br>The man got to his feet. ""It is, my lady.""
  <br><sup>A Game of Thrones - Catelyn V</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>On further inspection the show seems to back this up. Here's a quote from I believe Tyrion, though I'd have to re-watch to find out:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What happened here? Where is <strong>Lady Stark</strong>? Why didn't she receive me?
  <br>She wasn't feeling well.
  <br><sup>Game of Thrones, S01 E04, ""Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things""</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is also this quote from when Cat arrives at Kings Landing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Welcome to King's Landing, <strong>Lady Stark</strong>.
  <br>Would you mind following us?
  <br>I would.
  <br>We've done nothing wrong.
  <br>We've been instructed to escort you into the city.
  <br>Instructed?
  <br>I don't know who's providing your instructions, but Follow me, <strong>Lady Stark</strong>.
  <br><sup>Game of Thrones, S01 E03, ""Lord Snow""</sup></p>

<p>And every other reference I've found about Cat in show she has been called Stark.</p>

<p>Further down it seems to imply that Sansa did not become Sansa Lannister upon her marriage to Tyrion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given that the Starks and Lannisters were both Great Houses of equal social rank, both former royal houses, it therefore isn't automatically assumed that Sansa would switch to being known as ""Sansa Lannister"".</p>

"168959","Why is The Wall still manned?","<p>My understanding is that The Wall was built a long time ago -- on the order of thousands of years -- to keep all the nasty stuff from invading the more-developed parts of Westeros. It's also my understanding that nothing has really happened there for a similarly long time.</p>

<p>1,000+ years is a very long time, in human terms. Can you imagine <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian%27s_Wall"" rel=""noreferrer"">Hadrian's Wall</a> or <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Great Wall of China</a> still being patrolled? The time span is so long that several empires would have been-and-gone and whatever threat originally existed has long since faded into legend. Even if patrolling the wall didn't naturally diminish through complacency, it seems like ""Military Strategy 101"" and basic economics <em>not</em> to man hundreds of miles of wall, in bad conditions, against no obvious threat.</p>

<p>Enough time has passed such that any patrols would have dried up years ago.

"169052","Why didn't Ned Stark support this claim to the throne?","<p>Spoilers for the Season 7 finale of <em>Game of Thrones</em>, ""The Dragon and the Wolf"".</p>

<p>Given Ned Stark knew this information why did he choose to support Stannis' claim to the throne instead of revealing the truth about his nephew and supporting him as the heir?</p>

<p>Doing so would essentially invalidate the rebellion which Ned spent years fighting. But this seems less important considering one of the main causes of the rebellion was based on a lie (as Ned knew). </p>

<p>It certainly seems <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diZPm20DdLM"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ned was ready to tell Jon the truth</a> and not having Robert alive anymore would have certainly helped in this.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","169055","<p>There's a few problems with this.</p>

<p><strong>Night's Watch</strong></p>

<p>Jon had already gone off to the Night's Watch and sworn his vows. This means he legally could not claim the throne even if he knew about his birth right and wanted to. He swore an oath that he would spend his life at the wall with no titles, and it should be a death sentence to break that oath.</p>

<p><strong>Bastard Inheritance</strong></p>

<p>Even thought Ned knew about Jon's true father, it's likely he did not know about the marriage. This means that in Ned's eyes he is still a bastard regardless and would have very little to no claim for the throne.</p>

<p><em>Edit</em>: With regards to Warlord099's comment, yes Ned should believe that Jon is legitimate with Lyanna telling Ned his name is ""Aegon <em>Targaryen</em>"". But! There is an issue of proof then. Even if Ned wants to claim Jon as a true Targaryen he has to prove it which leads to complications that are better left detailed <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/133161/is-there-any-tangible-proof-of-jon-snows-lineage"">here</a>. Not to mention that even with having testimony or evidence of a marriage, it could be disputed or claimed fake. As we know, the true parentage of a character can be falsely claimed and people can believe it such as Robert's ""legitimate"" children.</p>

<p><strong>He made a promise</strong></p>

<p>When Ned took baby Jon from his sister he made a promise to protect him from being killed for his father's blood in him. This was mostly to protect him from the new King Robert. But even with Robert out of the picture declaring Jon as King because he is a Targaryen would put him in severe danger from those that don't wish to give up the throne and those that hate the Targaryens and don't want them in power.</p>

<p><strong>Baratheon Line</strong></p>

<p>With Robert's rebellion the line of succession has changed. Robert claimed the throne with a direct line connecting him to the Targaryen dynasty but mainly through right of conquest. This means that the original Targaryen line of succession has changed and is now following Robert's line the same as it did with Aegon after his conquest. This means that even a ""known"" true born son such as Aegon Targaryen VI from the books or Jon (Aegon Targaryen) Snow of the show would not have a claim without reconquering the kingdom in the name of the Targaryens.</p>

<p><strong>Mix of 1 and 3</strong></p>

<p>As they were both leaving Winterfell for King's Landing and Castle Black, Ned told Jon he was going to tell him the truth the next time they met. This would've been long after Jon had taken his vows and forsaken any claims he could make to the Targaryen house. We can infer that means Ned would be willing to have the truth be known but only when Jon would be safe. For even a true born Targaryen heir at the wall wasn't a threat as Maester Aemon had been there for years. If Ned was insisting on waiting for Jon to be protected by his vows then he would never have gone out of his way to put Jon in direct danger by declaring him the rightful king.</p>

<p>I know books have not gone that far but it will be fine if answer can provide context from the books.</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","169125","<p>Expanding on Edlothiad's answer, The War never was about Lyanna's abduction! I blame the singers for making out that it was fought as such because fighting for love is better for songs than fighting for your life. </p>

<p>See the timeline of these events.</p>

<p>Tourney of Harrenhal happened in 281 AC in which Rhaegar crowned Lyanna as Queen of Love and Beauty. When the Starks were on their way to Riverrun afterwards for Brandon's marriage, Rhaegar <em>abducted</em> Lyanna. </p>

<p>Brandon went to King's Landing to challenge Prince Rhaegar to ""Come out and die"". There he got himself imprisoned, the fool along with his friends Elbert Arryn, Jeffory Mallister, Kyle Royce and his squire Ethan Glover. Royal summons went to fathers of the captives, including but not exclusively, Rickard Stark. </p>

<p>Rickard travelled all the way to King's Landing as did fathers of the other captives. Aerys had them all killed (Except Ethan Glover).</p>

<p>How long do you think it took for them to travel? The captives and their fathers, all of them? Months presumably? Or at least Weeks?</p>

<p>Nobody raised any banners for Lyanna, nobody called their sworn swords. Everyone was just watching. </p>

<p>With all the prisoners executed, still no one lifted a finger.  However we must note that we do not know how much time did pass between the execution of prisoners and Royal edict calling for deaths of Ned and Bobby B. It could be that they received the word from the same bird that brought the royal command for execution of the young Lords. Still, the realm did nothing in the months of prelude before the war broke out. </p>

<p>The factor which actually started the war was Aerys' orders to have the young Lords Robert and Eddard executed. That's when Jon Arryn called his banners. Not for rescuing Lyanna and returning her back to her betrothed, but to save the lives of his foster sons. This was the year 282 AC.</p>

<p>As you can see, if Robert's Rebellion was indeed built on rescuing Lyanna, why didn't it break out as soon as Lyanna was abducted? Or as soon as Brandon was arrested as the monarch didn't appear to be in the mood to legally return the abducted girl? Brave Lord Robert did nothing till then, remarkable for someone whose words are ""Ours is the Fury"", no Fury was seen at all. Brave Lord Eddard didn't either even though Winter had come for House Stark. Neither did the honorable Lord Jon Arryn whose words were ""As High as Honor"". Nor did Lord Hoster Tully who boasted ""Family, Duty, Honor"". The Silence of the Lions of the Rock who proudly carved ""Hear me Roar"" on their gates and sigil was deafening. Lord Reaver of Pyke was pretending he wasn't even there. There are your Rebels, such as they are, the Glorious Honorable Lords who supposedly fought against the grave injustice done to Poor Robert Baratheon when bad Dragonprince stole away his Wolf-love. </p>

<p>Robert's Rebellion was based on only one thing, which was the lives and safety of the Young Lords Stark and Baratheon. It was never about Lyanna even though Robert personally wanted Lyanna more than he wanted a crown. But since he never rose until the alternative was his death, We can assume that he wanted his life more than Lyanna. </p>

<p>So Robert's Rebellion wasn't based on a lie. It was based on a truth, the sole truth which is the survival instinct of every living thing. It's just that Bran has been fed the lies that it was to rescue Lyanna.</p>

"169133","Did Lyanna's consent even matter?","<p>In the Westerosi society can <strong>an unmarried female of a noble house who has older male relatives</strong> even own property and get married <strong>without the consent of the patriarch of the family</strong>? </p>

<p>It seems that the marriages of daughters of other great houses, Cersei of house Lannister and Catelyn of house Tully were both decided and arranged by their relatives, and we also know that Lyanna herself was less than enthusiastic about her upcoming marriage with Robert Baratheon, and she shared her negative opinion with her brother Ned.</p>

<p>Could it be that when Lyanna's father Rickard Stark and older brother Brandon Stark demanded from the king that the 'kidnapped' Lyanna be returned it was simply because they had other plans for her and the 14-15 year old girl's decision (whether she was coerced, charmed or mutually in love with Rheagar) was irrelevant, as it was not hers to make? 
Could it be that Rhaegar's insult to the Starks was stealing their 'property', a female meant to strengthen their alliance with house Baratheon?
Could it be that they regarded an elopement of a young girl as kidnapping regardless of her opinions of 'silly romantic love', and put all the blame on Rhaegar who, in their opinion, should have known better and therefore was responsible? </p>

<p>Isn't it possible that when they went to negotiate with the king, the plan was either demand Lyanna's return, or if she was 'ruined' by Rheagar, then demand a solution, such as a divorce from Elia Martell or some such?</p>

<p>Was Lyanna the Westerosi equivalent of <a href=""https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Helen/helen.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Helen of Troy</a> who ran away with Paris of her own free will but still was the <s>cause</s> excuse for a war as no one cared what she wanted?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","169151","<p>TL;DR Yes, Noble Women in Westeros can and have defied wishes of the heads of their dynasties, when it comes to marriage. No one can be forced to marry someone without their consent. But in practice, there are numerous instances of people forcing other people to marry someone they do not desire.</p>
<h3>Culture</h3>
<p>The first thing that we have to consider is the Westerosi culture.</p>
<p>Westeros is based on medieval Europe where noble marriages were mostly, if not always, arranged for the political needs of the family. Women are not given equal status as men anywhere except Dorne. We see its manifestation in the succession practices of Westeros. Males always come before females everywhere except Dorne where they inherit on an equal basis primarily because of the Rhoynar influence on the Dornish people. And even in Dorne, marriage pacts are made by the patriarchs/matriarchs, not the women concerned.</p>
<h3>Laws</h3>
<p>Patriarchs apparently consider it their right to make a match for members of their house, regardless to gender. The chief example would be Blackfish: his brother Lord Hoster Tully considered it his legal right to make a match for him, even against his wishes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I told him … commanded him. Marry! <strong>I was his lord. He knows. My
right, to make his match</strong>. A good match. A Redwyne. Old House. Sweet
girl, pretty … freckles … Bethany, yes. Poor child. Still waiting.
Yes. Still …&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bethany Redwyne wed Lord Rowan years ago,&quot; Catelyn reminded him. &quot;She
has three children by him.&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>AGOT - Catelyn XI</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another Westerosi law is that if someone is Ward of the Crown, the Crown has the right to make their match, if the head of the Ward's dynasty is attainted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; Sansa blurted. &quot;No.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. You are a ward of the crown. <strong>The king stands in your father's
place, since your brother is an attainted traitor. That means he has
every right to dispose of your hand.</strong> You are to marry my brother
Tyrion.&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>ASOS - Sansa III</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>Marriages are done in religious ceremonies in Westeros and are governed by religious laws.</p>
<p>In the Faith of Seven, the most prevalent faith in Westeros, there is no compulsion in marriage. No one can be pronounced married if they refuse to say the vows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will tell my aunt that I don't want to marry Robert. <strong>Not even the
High Septon himself could declare a woman married if she refused to
say the vows</strong>.<br><sub><em><strong>ASOS - Sansa VII</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the faith of the Old Gods as well, it appears that there can be no marriage unless the couple says the vows out of their own will. Moreover, vows sworn at sword-point are not binding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The monster has tied us a thorny knot,&quot; the old knight told Maester
Luwin. &quot;<strong>Like it or no, Lady Hornwood was his wife. He made her say the</strong>
<strong>vows before both septon and heart tree, and bedded her that very night</strong>
<strong>before witnesses</strong>. She signed a will naming him as heir and fixed her
seal to it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Vows made at sword point are not valid</strong>,&quot; the maester argued.</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Roose Bolton may not agree.</strong> Not with land at issue.&quot; Ser Rodrik
looked unhappy.<br><sub><em><strong>ACOK - Bran V</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, as noted by Ser Rodrik, as long as one party says the vow, people can always object that since vows were sworn, the wedding was binding. There can always be a debate on whether or not the vows were sworn under duress.</p>
<p>So it appears that men and women can withhold their consent and refuse to get married if they want to.</p>
<h3>In Practice</h3>
<p>While it's all good and dandy in religion and laws, in practice these things do not matter.</p>
<p>We know people can force others into marrying against their wishes e.g. Sansa and Tyrion and Tywin's rejected proposal to Wed Cersei to Willas Tyrell. Similarly, Lysa Tully was forced to wed Jon Arryn (Although she was pressurized by Lord Hoster, she consented under the impression that Jon would die soon enough, given his advanced age) and Jon Arryn was forced to wed her. Lady Ermisande, an infant, was married to Tyrek Lannister and no one cared if she couldn't say the vows.</p>
<h3>So Spake Martin</h3>
<p>I have found a relevant Citadel Post. A fan asked GRRM for an explanation of Hoster Tully's declaration that it was his right as Blackfish's Lord to make his match. Does that mean Lords/Patriarchs can force anyone under their rule, regardless to their gender, to marry where they desire? <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Some_Questions/"" rel=""noreferrer"">GRRM's answer</a> was that the concerned people can refuse to say the vows but they can expect dire consequences from their patriarch, which are presumably exile, disinheritance and other forms of punishment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> &quot;I was his lord...My right, to make his match&quot; says Lord Hoster about Brynden. Does it mean that the lord can force anyone
under his rule to marry whomever he wishes? Can the people in question
legally break the commitments made for them by the lord (i.e.
promises, betrothals) and what penalty can the lord visit on them for
this? What if they just refuse to exchange the marriage vows, etc?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> They can indeed refuse to take the vows, as the Blackfish did, but there are often severe consequences to this. The lord is
certainly expected to arrange the matches for his own children and
unmarried younger siblings. He does not necessarily arrange marriages
for his vassal lords or household knights... but they would be wise to
consult with him and respect his feelings. It would not be prudent for
a vassal to marry one of his liege lord's enemies, for instance.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Precedent of women refusing to marry someone</h3>
<p>Alysanne Targaryen would be the first example when she rejected the match made by her mother and step-father. For context, King Jaehaerys had become King after a destructive war between Crown and the Faith during reigns of his father and uncle. The war was sparked by the issue of Targaryen custom of incest, given how it was seen as an affront to the gods by the Faith. Since the King was 14, his mother Alyssa Velaryon served as Queen Regent while her new husband Lord Rogar Baratheon served as the Hand and Lord Protector. Soon enough, The regency council set to find suitable matches for the King and his younger sister. While the council was aware that the young princelings would choose each other if given the choice, they had no intention to wed them given how much blood and grief had the custom of incest already caused. Notoriously ambitious, Lord Rogar proposed his brother Orryn Baratheon as groom for Princess Alysanne and the council assented (Choosing the King's bride proved more contentious and no consensus was found). Alysanne got the word of the council's plans, probably by her uncle Lord Daemon Velaryon, who may have resented the Baratheons for overreaching themselves and trying to replace Velaryons as the second House of the realm. Alysanne knew protests and pleading with her mother won't change anything so she immediately went to the King and urged him to pre-empt the council. The King shared her feelings and ordered his Kingsguards to sail for Dragonstone in secrecy right away. The King and his sister took wing for Dragonstone the same day without telling anyone. Once there, they were wed by Dragonstone's septon. Jaehaerys however decided not to consummate the wedding given Alysanne's young age. When the Lord Hand and Queen Regent came pursuing to Dragonstone a week later, they were horrified to find what had happened. Once Lord Hand realised that the wedding was not consummated, he tried to confine the King and his Queen to separate chambers until the wedding could be annulled. Kingsguards however threatened that if anyone laid hands on their King or Queen, he'd die. The Queen regent proclaimed she had seen enough blood and now they must all live with what had happened. King agreed and warned her that she should not assume that she'd be able to unmake their marriage. Alysanne concurred, to quote her:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Never,” his bride affirmed. “Send me to the ends of the earth and wed me to the King of Mossovy or the Lord of the Grey Waste, Silverwing will always bring me back to Jaehaerys.”<br><sub><em><strong>Fire and Blood</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then we have the case of Princess Daella Targaryen, daughter to the very same King Jaehaerys I and Queen Alysanne. She rejected a number of suitors suggested by her mother for variety of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The dashing grandson to Lord of Driftmark, Corlys Velaryon was rejected because the Princess believed he liked his ships better than her. He eventually married Daella's niece Rhaenys.</li>
<li>Denys Swann, son of the Lord of Stonehelm and Gerold Templeton, son of the Knight of Ninestars  were rejected because the Princess decided she hated them.</li>
<li>Simon Staunton, son of Lord of Rook's Rest was rejected because he tried to make her drink wine (She was 14).</li>
<li>Ellard Crane, son of the Lord of Red Lake was rejected because he kissed her without her leave.</li>
<li>Lord Blackwood's son Royce Blackwood was a close one. The Princess got along with him famously. Lord Blackwood and the Crown began discussing wedding dates and arrangements. It all fell apart when the Princess refused to marry him because she'd only just learnt that the Blackwoods kept the Old Gods and she didn't want to go to hell by marrying a heathen.</li>
</ol>
<p>The King despaired of her and flatly told the Queen to wed her quickly because he no longer cared who she chose as long as she picked someone, otherwise they'd have to send her to the Silent Sisters (Queen suggested that she should be made a Septa, the King rejected that because the Princess was not very gifted intellectually). Of course we must note that the King and the Queen didn't force her to marry until she rejected Blackwood boy. The Queen offered her a final choice of three great Lords which included the Queen's half-brother Lord Boremund Baratheon, Ser Tymond Lannister (Heir to Casterly Rock) and Lord Rodrik Arryn. The Princess chose Rodrik Arryn who already had four children and was close to her father's age.</p>
<p>Another unsuccessful example would be Princess Rhaenyra. Her father wanted her to marry Laenor Velaryon. The princess refused given Laenor's reputation for preferring the company of men. The King couldn't force her so instead he pleaded, reasoned, begged her to consent. The Princess wouldn't budge. It wasn't until Viserys threatened to disinherit her that the Princess finally gave her consent. While unsuccessful, it shows us that a woman can refuse the match made by the head of her dynasty. The best the head can do is threaten her with consequences. For someone prepared to face the consequences, it might not matter at all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>King and council had neglected to consult the princess, however, and Rhaenyra proved to be very much her father’s daughter, with her own
notions about whom she wished to wed</strong>. The princess knew much and
more about Laenor Velaryon and had no wish to be his bride. “My half
brothers would be more to his taste,” she told the king (the princess
always took care to refer to Queen Alicent’s sons as half brothers,
never as brothers). And though <strong>His Grace reasoned with her, pleaded
with her, shouted at her, and called her an ungrateful daughter, no
words of his could budge her</strong> … until the <strong>king brought up the
question of succession</strong>. What a king had done, a king could undo,
Viserys pointed out. <strong>She would wed as he commanded, or he would make
her half brother Aegon his heir in place of her. At this the
princess’s will gave way.</strong><br><sub><em><strong>The Rogue Prince</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also the case of Baela Targaryen. She was the heir of her brother King Aegon III during his minority. Since House Targaryen was nearly extinguished except King Aegon and his sisters (his brother Prince Viserys was missing and presumed dead), the regents wanted to secure the royal line in case some ill befell the King. As the King was a minor, it had to be his sisters who would have to wed and give birth to more Targaryens.</p>
<p>Unlike her courteous and gentle twin sister Rhaena, Baela was wild and daring. As she continued to consort with comely hedge knights, mummers, singers and other unsuitable people, the Regency council feared that she might <em>dishonour</em> her brother and the Crown if she weren't wed soon. A number of great Lords or their heirs were discussed and rejected by the council because they feared that a strong man might usurp the rule from Baela if she ever sat the throne. Then Thaddeus Rowan's name was suggested. Lord Rowan was well liked, respected and of a high and noble bloodline, he was the perfect match due to his content and amiable nature. Except that he was forty years older than the Princess and already had children (Two of whom she claimed to have bedded - which may have been a lie because she often liked to provoke the regents), nor was he physically attractive.</p>
<p>Baela said as much and the Hand confined her to her rooms under guard and she was to stay there until the regents decided what to do. She went to the room as ordered but within a day, she escaped dressed as a washerwoman and before the Regents even noticed, she was half-way to Driftmark where her cousin the powerful Lord Alyn Velaryon ruled. 15 days later she was married to Lord Alyn defying the wishes of the regents who claimed to speak for her brother (The King was neither informed nor consulted on the matter).</p>
<p>Some on the council wished to appeal to the High Septon to annul the marriage but the Hand personally accepted it and issued a public statement that the marriage was arranged by the Council with the consent of the King. He believed the Princess' choice was sound, Lord Alyn was after-all of impeccable Valyrian blood, popular, a great lord in his own right and a celebrated admiral at such a young age. The scandal was not the marriage, but rather the fact that Baela had eloped so that was what they must hide.</p>
<p>So while the council was happy for the young couple as far as public image was concerned, Baela's daring cost her her place as the heir apparent. The council quietly agreed that Baela must be passed over and Rhaena should be considered the heir. Baela's defiance however produced some positive results too, when considering Rhaena's prospective husband, the council included her in their sessions. Charming and courteous as usual Rhaena reassured the council that she would wed whoever the council deemed suitable but the Hand still sought her own thoughts on the matter. Rhaena immediately confessed she liked Ser Corwyn Corbray. As a second son of a not <em>that great</em> house, he was not ideal but the regents accepted Rhaena's choice and had them married (In part because Corwyn's elder brother was an important member of the council). One could say that Baela pulled <em>a Lyanna</em> (Or rather Lyanna pulled a Baela), but Baela's marriage proved to be much happier than Lyanna's.</p>
<p>Another xample would be Princess Shaera Targaryen. She was betrothed to Lord Luthor Tyrell but it was her brother Jaehaerys whom she desired. She knew their father, Aegon V, who disliked the Targaryen custom of incest, would never approve of it. So instead of taking it up with the King, the Princess and the Prince eloped. In doing so, Shaera ended her betrothal to Lord Tyrell and her brother's betrothal to Celia Tully. She didn't refuse as such, as she knew the futility of such refusals, she instead took matters into her own hands.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Prince Jaehaerys was of a more traditional bent, for from a very early age he had loved his sister Shaera</strong> and dreamed of wedding her
in the old Targaryen fashion. Once aware of his desires, <strong>King Aegon
and Queen Betha had done their best to separate the two</strong>, yet somehow
distance only seemed to inflame the mutual passion of this prince and
princess.</p>
<p>Prince Jaehaerys was not as forceful as his brother, but when Duncan
defied his father to follow his own heart, and the king and court
yielded to his desire, the younger prince did not fail to take note.
In 240 AC, a year after Prince Duncan's marriage, <strong>Prince Jaehaerys
and Princess Shaera each eluded their guardians and were secretly
married</strong>. Jaehaerys was fifteen and Shaera fourteen at the time of
their wedding. <strong>By the time the king and queen learned what had
happened, the marriage had already been consummated. Aegon felt he had
no choice but to accept it.</strong><br><sub><em><strong>TWOIAF - Targaryen Kings:
Aegon V</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Olenna Redwyne was betrothed to Prince Daeron Targaryen. There are however conflicting accounts of how the betrothal ended. Olenna Tyrell says she put an end to it herself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Her grandmother snorted. &quot;Gallant, yes, and charming, and very clean.
He knew how to dress and he knew how to smile and he knew how to
bathe, and somehow he got the notion that this made him fit to be
king. The Baratheons have always had some queer notions, to be sure.
It comes from their Targaryen blood, I should think.&quot; She sniffed.
&quot;<strong>They tried to marry me to a Targaryen once, but I soon put an end
to that.</strong>&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>ASOS - Sansa I</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She doesn't mention how she put an end to it. Did she refuse explicitly? Or did she ask the prince to call off the wedding?</p>
<p>In the TV show, she said that she had actually seduced Lord Tyrell who was betrothed to her sister, who then asked to marry her instead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I wasn't originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor</strong>, you know. <strong>He was engaged to my sister</strong>, your great-aunt Viola.</p>
<p><strong>I was to be given to some Targaryen</strong> or other. Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then. But <strong>the moment I saw my intended, with
his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he
wouldn't do</strong>.</p>
<p>So <strong>the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister, I got lost
on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his
chamber</strong>. How absentminded of me.</p>
<p>The following morning, <strong>Luthor never made it down the stairs to
propose to my sister</strong> 'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk.</p>
<p>And once he could, <strong>the only thing he wanted was what I'd given him
the night before</strong>. I was good. I was very, very good.<br><sub><em><strong>Season 4 -
Oathkeeper</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that is in contrast with the books as Luthor Tyrell himself was betrothed to the above mentioned Princess Shaera Targaryen, sister to Prince Daeron. But in any case, Olenna didn't get married to Daeron Targaryen and got married to Luthor Tyrell instead.</p>
<p>The World of Ice and Fire however suggests that it was Prince Daeron who called off the wedding as he was homosexual and had no interest in women.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Corrupted by the example of his brothers, even King Aegon's youngest
son Prince Daeron vexed his father in like manner. <strong>Though betrothed
to Lady Olenna Redwyne of the Arbor when both of them were nine,
Prince Daeron repudiated the match in 246 AC, when he was
eighteen</strong>...though in his case, there appears to have been no other
woman, for <strong>Daeron remained unwed</strong> throughout the remainder of his
short life. A born soldier who rejoiced in tournament and battle, <strong>he
preferred the companionship of Ser Jeremy Norridge</strong><br><sub><em><strong>TWOIAF - Targaryen Kings: Aegon V</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is possible that Olenna and Daeron worked together to call off their wedding. Daeron grew up in Highgarden after all, where he was sent as a squire. Olenna Redwyne's father was a chief vassal of Highgarden so she would have had ample opportunities of meeting her betrothed and plotting to call off the wedding.</p>
<p>In more recent events, Princess Arianne Martell rejected all the suitors her father Prince Doran Martell presented her. She wanted a young handsome man of powerful background instead of old men but her father always presented her with Old men. When Renly Baratheon came to Dorne, Arianne tried her best to <em>seduce</em> him, in hopes of him asking for her hand. King's handsome youngest brother however seemed only bemused, rather than aroused by her antics (Arianne blames herself for the failure, thinking it was her young age which failed her. We know it was rather Renly's sexual orientation.) Then Hoster Tully sent proposal of his heir Ser Edmure Tully, Princess Arianne lit a candle in sept to thank the gods but her father promptly refused the offer. She got so desperate that she was willing to accept even Willas Tyrell, the crippled heir to Highgarden. She went as far as fleeing towards Highgarden without her father's leave to meet Willas, she was however intercepted by her uncle Prince Oberyn on the way and brought back to Sunspear. Her father was unwilling to let any young, handsome highborn man be her suitor and the princess was unwilling to accept any of the old men her Father presented her. Her father even presented her with Lord Walder Frey, it wasn't until Walder married elsewhere that she was truly safe from him. She rejected them all. But we know why her father behaved as he did. That's another story. What matters is, she rejected them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Prince Doran did not mean for her to wed a Dornishman.</p>
<p>Arianne had accepted that as well. One year King <strong>Robert's brother
came to visit and she did her best to seduce him, but she was half a
girl and Lord Renly seemed more bemused</strong> than inflamed by her
overtures. Later, when <strong>Hoster Tully asked her to come to Riverrun
and meet his heir</strong>, she lit candles to the Maid in thanks, but Prince
Doran had declined the invitation. <strong>The princess might even have
considered Willas Tyrell, crippled leg and all, but her father refused
to send her to Highgarden to meet him</strong>. She tried to go despite him,
with Tyene's help . . . but Prince Oberyn caught them at Vaith and
brought them back.</p>
<p>That same year, Prince Doran tried to betroth her to Ben Beesbury, a
minor lordling who was eighty if he was a day, and as blind as he was
toothless. Beesbury died a few years later. That gave her some small
comfort in her present pass; she could not be forced to marry him if
he was dead. And the Lord of the Crossing had wed again, so she was
safe from him as well. Elden Estermont is still alive and unwed,
though. Lord Rosby and Lord Grandison as well. Grandison was called
the Greybeard, but by the time she'd met him his beard had gone snow
white. At the welcoming feast, he had gone to sleep between the fish
course and the meat. Drey called that apt, since his sigil was a
sleeping lion. Garin challenged her to see if she could tie a knot in
his beard without waking him, but Arianne refrained. Grandison had
seemed a pleasant fellow, less querulous than Estermont and more
robust than Rosby. <strong>She would never marry him, however. Not even if
Hotah stands behind me with his axe</strong>.<br><sub><em><strong>AFFC - The Princess in the Tower</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In theory Lyanna's consent mattered. She could refuse to say the vows and make her own destiny if she was brave enough which, as it happened, she was. But Lord Rickard could force Lyanna to marry Robert in practice.</p>

<p>Why did he say that? Did he imply that since his son refused to obey him he will no longer help him or that since he decided to remain in the Kingsguard, he will be heir no more and by extension, be no part of the family?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","169191","<h3>Show</h3>
<p>Tywin actually disowned Jaime there. He wanted Jaime to do his duty to his family, Jaime refused. Tywin noted that he has tried for forty years to teach him and if Jaime has not learnt by now, he never will. Kingsguard only forsake their claims, not their family names like Maesters do. His vows don't make him any less part of House Lannister. Its his insistence that his duty as KG comes above his duty as a Lannister that made Tywin disown him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tywin: You can't serve in the Kingsguard with one hand.</p>
<p>Jaime: Where's that written? I can and I will. The Kingsguard oath is

<p>Jaime: Home?</p>

<p>Turned out Cersei was right. Tywin accepted Jaime's offer to become heir to Casterly Rock if he let Tyrion live afterwards.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Books</h3>
<p>This is how it happened in the books, it was more clear that Tywin had disowned Jaime after he refused to do service for his house and when Tywin said he was his son, Jaime said he was a Knight of Kingsguard. So one can say, it was Jaime who burnt the bridges.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“You cannot serve in the Kingsguard without a sword hand -”</strong></p>
<p>“<strong>I can</strong>,” he interrupted. “And I will. There’s precedent. I’ll look
in the White Book and find it, if you like. <strong>Crippled or whole, a
knight of the Kingsguard serves for life.</strong>”</p>
<p>“<strong>Cersei ended that when she replaced Ser Barristan</strong> on grounds of
age. A suitable gift to the Faith will persuade the High Septon to
release you from your vows. Your sister was foolish to dismiss Selmy,
admittedly, but now that <strong>she has opened the gates</strong> -”</p>
<p>“- <strong>someone needs to close them again</strong>.” Jaime stood. “I am tired of
having highborn women kicking pails of shit at me, Father. No one ever
asked me if I wanted to be Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, but it
seems I am. <strong>I have a duty</strong> -”</p>
<p>“<strong>You do.</strong>” Lord Tywin rose as well. “<strong>A duty to House Lannister.
You are the heir to Casterly Rock.</strong> That is where you should be.
Tommen should accompany you, as your ward and squire. The Rock is
where he’ll learn to be a Lannister, and I want him away from his
mother. I mean to find a new husband for Cersei. Oberyn Martell
perhaps, once I convince Lord Tyrell that the match does not threaten
Highgarden. And it is past time you were wed. The Tyrells are now
insisting that Margaery be wed to Tommen, but if I were to offer you
instead -”</p>
<p>“NO!” Jaime had heard all that he could stand. No, more than he could
stand. He was sick of it, sick of lords and lies, sick of his father,
his sister, sick of the whole bloody business. “<strong>No. No. No. No. No.
How many times must I say no before you’ll hear it?</strong> Oberyn Martell?
The man’s infamous, and not just for poisoning his sword. He has more
bastards than Robert, and beds with boys as well. And if you think for
one misbegotten moment that I would wed Joffrey’s widow...”</p>
<p>“Lord Tyrell swears the girl’s still maiden.”</p>
<p>“She can die a maiden as far as I’m concerned. I don’t want her, and I
don’t want your Rock!”</p>
<p>“<strong>You are my son</strong> -”</p>
<p>“<strong>I am a knight of the Kingsguard. The Lord Commander of the

<p>Firelight gleamed golden in the stiff whiskers that framed Lord
Tywin’s face. A vein pulsed in his neck, but he did not speak. And did
not speak. And did not speak.</p>
<p>The strained silence went on until it was more than Jaime could
endure.</p>
<p>“Father...” he began. <br><br>“<strong>You are not my son</strong>.” Lord Tywin turned his face

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","169203","<h2>Their previous lives are NOT wiped away.</h2>
<p>Lord Commander Mormont is not saying you must give up your houses, as that is not the case for the Night's Watch. As TheLethalCoder said, he is merely saying that everyone comes as equal.</p>

<p>Some of you bear the names of proud Houses, others only bastard names or no names at all. It does not matter. <strong>All that is in the past. Here on the Wall we are all one House.</strong></p>

<p>Outside the wall, those with the names of proud Houses would be considered superior to bastards which would be considered superior to those without any names. At the wall however, none of this matters, they are all equal regardless of previous rank.</p>
<p>As for why Jon was given a hard time for not giving Lord Slynt his proper title, those who have been knighted or given Lordship before swearing their vows at the Wall keep their titles. Lord Mormont was Lord Mormont at the wall before he became Lord Commander, similarly, Ser Alliser Thorne was knighted during the Targaryen rule and fought along side the Royalists during Robert's Rebellion</p>

<p>Ser Alliser Thorne did not lose his title when he came to the wall, just like Lord Slynt didn't.</p>
<p>As for the words in the oath quoted by TheLethalCoder,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I shall wear no crowns and win no glory.</p>

<p>This simply means that they will not take any more crowns. They forsake their right to be the heir of their house or the Seven Kingdoms when they come to the wall. They can no longer return to their houses and take up the Lordship of their house. As for win no glory. They will not be raised for their glory in battle, they will gain no lands and no titles. They live to serve the Night's Watch and will die serving the Night's Watch.</p>
<p>The only orders where your House is removed his with the Maesters and the Faith, they only retain their first name, this led Maester Aemon to lead a forgotten life as the Last Targaryen living in Westeros.

","<game-of-thrones>","169414","<h1>We Don't Know</h1>

<p>It would seem that all life we know of north of the Wall is dead:</p>

<li>Children of the Forest: Died during the attack on the Three-eyed Raven's lair.</li>
<li>Benjen Stark: Was already dead but was re-killed in the merry men's attempt to capture a wight.</li>
<li>Craster's lot: Presumably all dead.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, the North is a large place and we don't know exactly how many White Walkers there are that can turn the dead. So it would appear to us, the viewer, that all are dead. However, it is also very possible that some people have managed to survive and evade the White Walkers. The north is a large place.</p>

<p>Also remember that the White Walker's, although have been taking their time, seem to have made their moment to attack the 7 kingdoms. When the time is now you don't wait to pick up a few surviving stragglers you go for it with all your might.</p>

<p>As @Flater mentions in a comment it also seems likely that animals can still be alive beyond the Wall:</p>

<ul>
<li>We see a bear wight, presumably it was living beyond the wall before it was killed.</li>
<li>The Three-eyed Raven's ravens can live north of the Wall.</li>
<li>Animals that wildlings used to eat had to live beyond the Wall, same goes for whatever Craster and his lot ate.</li>
</ul>

<p>It would make sense, as we don't see too many wight animals, that some of these are still alive.</p>

<p>White Walker's seem to be another species and are alive in their own right. As per the Season 7 finale we only saw a couple cross the Wall. Even though we don't know the exact amount we know there are at least more than that so it makes sense to state that not everything is dead beyond the Wall... at the moment.</p>

","<game-of-thrones>","169564","<p>The Faceless Men obviously have access to some kind of magic:</p>

<ul>
<li>When they wear a face their physique/body and voice changes as well.</li>

<p>With that in mind it is easy to assume that a fully trained Faceless Man could have a stronger connection to the magic and be able to use faces of those that are still alive. As @Skooba puts it so well on <a href=""https://movies.stackexchange.com/a/55425/45378"">his answer to a related question on MTVSE</a> I'll quote some of it here:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jaqen seems to be the leader of the group. This would imply he has a greater or direct interaction with the many faced (similar to how R'hollor will ""speak"" through the Red Priests). While the extent of this is not fully defined, I believe this example proves this point.</p>

<p>We could also speculate that because of this it appears he may even be able to use any face he wants and not just those of the dead.</p>

<p>A few other speculations as to how it worked:</p>

<ul>
<li>Arya was ""drugged"" and so it was actually just an hallucination.</li>

<p>After re-taking the Night's Watch, getting the Wildlings south of the Wall, re-taking Winterfell, being crowned King in the North and subsequently swearing fealty to Daenerys, we learn that Jon is in fact the trueborn (somehow) son of Rhaegar and Lyanna, and that his real name his Aegon Targaryen.</p>

"169616","Why didn't Robb Stark give Rickard Karstark the option to take the black?","<p>In Game of Thrones, it is common to offer people the option to 'take the black' as a punishment for serious offenses, that is, to join the Night's Watch rather than face execution or imprisonment.  Furthermore, as Wardens of the North, the Starks feel a particular responsibility to keep the Night's Watch strong.  </p>

<p>So how come Robb Stark chose to simply execute Lord Rickard Karstark as punishment for murdering the Lannister hostages?  Did Robb not feel the same responsibility to the Night's Watch?  Would this option have been considered and then rejected for some reason?  Would his counsellors have advised him to consider this course of action?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","169617","<h1>A Song of Ice and Fire</h1>
<p>Leniency does not come with disrespect, it requires remorse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Has Your Grace forgotten that we are at war with Casterly Rock? In war you kill your enemies. Didn’t your father teach you that, boy?”<br />
“Boy?” The Greatjon dealt Rickard Karstark a buffet with a mailed fist that sent the other lord to his knees.<br />
“Leave him!” Robb’s voice rang with command. Umber stepped back away from the captive.<br />
Lord Karstark spit out a broken tooth. “Yes, Lord Umber, leave me to the king. He means to give me a scolding before he forgives me. That’s how he deals with treason, our King in the North.” He smiled a wet red smile. “or should I call you the King Who Lost the North, Your Grace?”<br />
<sub>A Storm of Swords - Catelyn III</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This evidently shows that Karstark has no respect for Robb, thinking of him as weak for losing the North and for going on this fools plight to &quot;rescue&quot; his sisters and avenge his father. Even the Greatjon is enraged by the disrespect and beats Lord Karstark.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Pardon him, then,” urged Edmure Tully.<br />
Robb stared at him in frank disbelief.<br />
Under that gaze, Edmure’s face reddened. “Spare his life, I mean. I don’t like the taste of it any more than you, sire. He slew my men as well. Poor Delp had only just recovered from the wound Ser Jaime gave him. Karstark must be punished, certainly. Keep him in chains, say.”<br />
“A hostage?” said Catelyn. It might be best...<br />
“Yes, a hostage!” Her brother seized on her musing as agreement. “Tell the son that so long as he remains loyal, his father will not be harmed. Otherwise... we have no hope of the Freys now, not if I offered to marry all Lord Walder’s daughters and carry his litter besides. If we should lose the Karstarks as well, what hope is there?”<br />
<sub>ibid.</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Robb had evidently given this though, with both his mother and uncle pleading with him, Robb had some reason to be defiant, something led him to his decision for execution and not a pardoning.</p>
<p>Robb later states clear and true why he had to execute the Lord.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I know what I said, Uncle. It does not change what I must do.” The swords in his crown stood stark and black against his brow. “In battle I might have slain Tion and Willem myself, but this was no battle. They were asleep in their beds, naked and unarmed, in a cell where I put them. Rickard Karstark killed more than a Frey and a Lannister. He killed my honor. I shall deal with him at dawn.”<br />

</blockquote>
<p>Robb's honour had been tainted for that Lord Karstark must be executed.<br />
Not only that but Robb could not look weak in front of his men. Any common sellsword would've been executed for the act, he had to portray the same strength for those of greater lineage. Showing weakness would cause his army to lose faith in him. He had to remain strong and fair, he passed the sentence, and he had to swing the sword.</p>
<h1>Game Of Thrones</h1>
<p>In the TV Show, Rickard Karstark repeatedly insults Robb before his death. Not only did Rickard betray Robb's trust. He broke his honour. Killing two boys in their cell while they slep.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It's treason to free your enemies! In war, you kill your enemies! Did your father not teach you that, boy!?&quot;<br />

</blockquote>
<p>Rickard clearly does not value Robb's decision. Again, leniency doesn't come with disrespect, it comes with contrition. Of which Rickard showed non.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Leave me to the King. He wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free. That's how he deals with treason. Our King in the North. Or should I call him 'the King who lost the North'?&quot;<br />
<sub>Rickard to Brynden Tully</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again Rickard calls Robb a craven, saying he won't be able to kill him, mocking the King, his King. Not only that but he also gives up on Robb's cause. After the Iron Islanders had taken the North while they were in the Riverlands, claiming he &quot;lost the North&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rickard Karstark: &quot;The blood of the First Men flows in my veins as much as yours, boy. I fought the Mad King for your father. I fought Joffrey for you. We are kin, Stark and Karstark.&quot;<br />
Robb Stark: &quot;That didn't stop you from betraying me, and it won't save you now.&quot;<br />
Rickard Karstark: &quot;I don't want it to save me. I want it to haunt you to the end of your days.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, Karstark expresses his disdain. He continues to mock Robb.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Kill me and be cursed! You are no King of mine!&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, Karstark gives up on the King entirely. He shows no respect even at his death.</p>

"169622","Are the Faceless Men and the Iron Bank connected?","<p>It occurred to me that both the Iron Bank and the Faceless Men hail from the city of Braavos. </p>

<p>It is mentioned once or twice in the books that the Iron bank has funded wars for Kings and Queens in past struggles for power. </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>This is further recently acknowledged in Season 7 of the show with Cersei's hire of the Golden Company with money borrowed from the Iron Bank.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The assassins known as the Faceless Men have also been used for various political reasons. They are even considered for the assassination of Daenerys. One of the primary reasons they were not used was due to the cost.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""On Braavos there is a society called the Faceless Men,"" Grand Maester Pycelle offered.</p>
  
  <p>""Do you have any idea how costly they are?"" Littlefinger complained. ""You could hire an army of common sellswords for half the price, and that's for a merchant. I don't dare think what they might ask for a princess.""</p>
  
  <p><sub>A Game of Thrones - Eddard VIII</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>With both of these things in mind, is there anything that suggests that the Iron Bank and the Faceless Men are connected in any way? I suspect that the Iron Bank may have gained their wealth through the earnings of the Faceless Men and enforce the debts they are owed through them.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","169628","<p><strong>There is no evidence that supports this theory, both in the books or in the show.</strong></p>

<p>These two organizations without a doubt are based on the same Free City, but besides that, there is nothing that could suggest a direct involvement of one in the activities of the other.</p>

<p>The simple fact that their businesses, directly or indirectly, concern large sums of gold, is not a proof that they share common interests or that they are associates an any way: other banks are known to exist in the other Free Cities as well, and even some Great Houses in Westeros, mainly the Lannisters of course, but also the Tyrells, are known to be very wealty.<br>
This does not mean that the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Iron_Bank_of_Braavos"" rel=""noreferrer"">Iron Bank</a>, all the other banks, the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Faceless_Men"" rel=""noreferrer"">Faceless Men</a>, the Lannisters and the Tyrells all together are something of a single ""cartel"", just because they are rich.</p>

<p>Of course nothing prevents any of these parties to do business with the other (like in example, Lannisters borrowing money from the Iron Bank), so it is <em>possible</em> that the Iron Bank employs the service of the Faceless Men on the more desperate cases, but it seems that a usually it is sufficient for them to act against their debtors by supporting their enemies:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tycho Nestoris had impressed him as cultured and courteous, but the Iron Bank of Braavos had a fearsome reputation when collecting debts. Each of the Nine Free Cities had its bank, and some had more than one, fighting over every coin like dogs over a bone, but the Iron Bank was richer and more powerful than all the rest combined. <strong>When princes defaulted on their debts to lesser banks, ruined bankers sold their wives and children into slavery and opened their own veins. When princes failed to repay the Iron Bank, new princes sprang up from nowhere and took their thrones.</strong><br>

</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/The_World_of_Ice_%26_Fire"" rel=""noreferrer"">The World of Ice &amp; Fire</a> give more details about the birth of the Iron Bank, ruling out any involvement of the Faceless Men:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Braavos is also home to one of the most powerful banks in the world, whose roots stretch back to the beginnings of the city, when a few of the fugitives took to <strong>hiding such valuables as they had in an abandoned iron mine to keep them safe from thieves and pirates. As the city grew and prospered, the shafts and chambers of the mine began to fill. Rather than let their treasure sit idle in the earth, the wealthier Braavosi began to make loans to their less fortunate brethren.</strong><br>
  Thus was born the Iron Bank of Braavos, whose renown (or infamy, to hear some tell it) now extends to every corner of the known world. Kings, princes, archons, triarchs, and merchants beyond count travel from the ends of the earth to seek loans from the heavily guarded vaults of the Iron Bank.<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice and Fire - The Free Cities: Braavos</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are also details of the current management:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Archmaester Matthar's The Origins of the Iron Bank and Braavos provides one of the more detailed accounts of the bank's history and dealings, so far as they can be discovered; the bank is famous for its discretion and its secrecy. <strong>Matthar recounts that the founders of the Iron Bank numbered three-and-twenty; sixteen men and seven women, each of whom possessed a key to bank's great subterranean vaults. Their descendants, whose numbers now exceed one thousand, are known as keyholders to this day, though the keys they display proudly on formal occasions are now entirely ceremonial.</strong> Certain of the founding families of Braavos have declined over the centuries, and a few have lost their wealth entirely, yet even the meanest still cling to their keys and the honors that go with them.<br>
  <strong>The Iron Bank is not ruled by the keyholders alone, however. Some of the wealthiest and most powerful families in Braavos today are of more recent vintage, yet the heads of these houses own shares in the bank, sit on its secret councils, and have a voice in selecting the men who lead it. In Braavos, as many an outsider has observed, golden coins count for more than iron keys.</strong> The bank's envoys cross the world, oft upon the bank's own ships, and merchants, lords, and even kings treat with them almost as equals.<br>

"169868","Population of Iron Islands?","<p>We know that Iron Islands has a huge navy. It is their main strength. We also know that Iron Islands are barren land, very small and even if they fish extensively, it should not support a population as great as the North. In fact, it was one of their motives when they waged war against the North, to obtain <em>Lebensraum</em> for their people.</p>

<p>I am not really shocked with their ship building efficiency. They might steal the wood easily from many unprotected forests in the North or in the Riverlands. The Iron Fleet should already have around 500 ships in total. Building 500 more in one or two years for a seafarer nation should not be the greatest challenge.</p>

<p>However, for such a small nation to man even 500 ships efficiently puzzles me. In a world where the North can muster 20000 men (if they took their time it would at most be 40000), how did Iron Islands man 1000 ships? What would be the crew per ship?</p>

<p>One of the best comparisons I could find is the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Taking_of_Deepwood_Motte"" rel=""noreferrer"">taking of Deepwood Motte</a>, where Asha Greyjoy commaned 30 longships and about 1000 men, making it about 30 men per ship. <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Fight_by_Deepwood_Motte"" rel=""noreferrer"">Battle for Deepwood Motte</a> is another possible reference point, where it is claimed that Asha Greyjoy had 4 longships and 200 men. This makes 50 men per longship.</p>

<p>So, how can Iron Islands support a fighting population of 30000 while the best North can do is 40000?</p>

<p>Book answers are preferred but TV show answers are also welcome.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","169880","<p>The true answer is we do not know the exact size of the Iron Islands population and so it seems appropriate to use @Aegon's image here:</p>

<p>However, the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Iron_Islands"" rel=""noreferrer"">awoiaf page on the Iron Islands</a> cites that they have 20,000 men and 500 longships which in turn is cited from ""A Game of Thrones: d20-based Open Gaming RPG."" which is a semi-canon source. </p>

<p>We can also get a figure of 15,000 fighting men from <a href=""https://atlasoficeandfireblog.wordpress.com/2016/03/06/the-population-of-the-seven-kingdoms/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this post on atlasoficeandfireblog</a> which is cited from this video by Elio Garcia:</p>

            </div></div></p>

<p>From there the article extrapolates that the Iron Islands has a population of 1.5 million but that is using a basis that the fighters make up 1% of the population which seems low for a nation such as the Ironborn. Using a figure more around 10% we get 150,000 which seems more reasonable. This isn't exactly unfeasible as in WWII many nations managed to get around 10% fighting population although it isn't sustainable but these are times of war for Westeros.</p>

<p>So using both figures for fighting men and a rough estimate of between 1-10% of the population being fighters we get a population between 150,000 and 2,000,000 though it seems likely to be on the lower side of things.</p>

<p>However, in my opinion (especially as they rely on raiding), the percentage of fighting men is likely around 3-5% maybe a bit higher which gives a total population of between 450,000 and 1,000,000.</p>

The reason, probably, is that nearly all the main characters are of noble birth, and, considering the strong influences of our own Medieval History on this series, this is not surprising: the sword is the main weapon of a knight and a noble, and even a symbol of knighthood itself.</p>

<p>Even the <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Military_strength"" rel=""noreferrer"">composition of armies</a> seems to be described more on terms of knights and footsoldiers, we hear relatively less about archers.</p>

<p>The Raven's teeth are the largest regiment of archers we come to meet. Being loyal to the crown and Bloodraven's personal escort, they were based in King's Landing in the Crownlands. The extent to which their makeup was from the Crownlands is unknown, but we can guess that many would be from lesser houses in the Crownlands, and not necessarily from other realms (as those Lord would likely keep good archers to themselves). This force was 500 men strong during the First Blackfyre Rebellion at the Redgrass field. At the Second Blackfyre rebellion, Bloodraven only took part of his escort to Whitewalls, which consisted of 300 Raven's Teeth. And finally as noted below, a portion of the Raven's Teeth went with Brynden Rivers when he was sent to the wall, this group included 200 men.</p></li>
<li><p>The Wall</p>

<p>As we see from some of the men listed below, the wall had many bowmen and some of particularly great renown (at least amongst the Black Brothers). We know that bowmen are useful from shooting down off the top of the wall. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They'd hung a target on the granary doors, so they could seem to be honing their skills as archers, but he knew lurkers when he saw them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of these archers were most likely trained at the Wall, as in later years most recruits were: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a pack of thieves, killers, and baseborn churls.<br>
  <sub>A Storm of Swords - Tyrion IV</sub></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>The Lannisters</p>

<p>They're said to have foot archers (3 lines worth) led by Kevan Lannister. What types of bows they used is unknown.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>His uncle would lead the center. Ser Kevan had raised his standards above the kingsroad. Quivers hanging from their belts, the foot archers arrayed themselves into three long lines, to east and west of the road, and stood calmly stringing their bows.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>The Golden Company</p>

<p>I won't go into extensive detail here as I don't want to be accused for stealing an answer that was posted below. (Although the relevant quotes can be found under ""Black Balaq"") The Golden company contained 1000 archers led by Black Balaq, a third of which were Westerosi born. Although they are currently in the Stormlands and as of <em>The Winds of Winter</em> have taken Storm's End, they were trained in the Free Cities and not in Westeros and therefore can't be counted amongst the best ""trained"" archers of a realm in Westeros.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Quality of equipment</h2>

<p>The longest range bows in <em>Planetos</em> are Dragonbone, ""greatly prized by the Dothraki"" followed by those of the Goldenheart tree, used by the Summer Islanders.</p>

<p>However we care about westeros, where the only bows that seems to get mentioned are Dornish yew Longbows, used by the Westerosi in the Golden Company, and those made of Weirwood, as used by Bryden Rivers and Ygritte. Dorne and the North therefore seem to be the most equipt for making the best bows.</p>

<p><hr>
What we do know is there were some great archers (in the Seven Kingdoms), and we know where they were from. Since we don't know for a fact which realm was the best, I've decided to look at individual archers (of great renown or skill) and see where they came from and how those add up.</p>

  <p>That afternoon a boy named Anguy, an unheralded commoner from the Dornish Marches, won the archery competition, outshooting Ser Balon Swann and Jalabhar Xho at a hundred paces after all the other bowmen had been eliminated at the shorter distances. Ned sent Alyn to seek him out and offer him a position with the Hand's guard, but the boy was flush with wine and victory and riches undreamed of, and he refused.<br>

Ronnel Harclay is of House Harclay in the North. </p>

</ul></li>
<li><strong>Planetos</strong>

<ul>
<li>Summer Islands (4)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>From the above tables. We can see that the Stormlands has produced the most talent, of which the Dornish Marches (part of the Stormlands and the Reach) were the key provider of skill. Dorne proper, however only produced one renowned archer, as did various other realms. Considering we have 4 unknowns, any of the realms could take the top spot and be the greatest. So I'm going to conclude with a bit of conjecture, but considering the Summer Islanders did trade with Westeros from before the first men, and Landed at Old Town and King's Landing, it is likely their trade was taught around nearby southern ports. Leading on to my additional bit.</p>

<p>Finally, the Summer Islands are infamous for their archery, although they are not part of Westeros and the Seven Kingdoms, they are known for their great skill with a goldenheart bow and producing bows which are second only in range to those made of dragonbone.</p>

<p>List of things I plan to work on:
 - More on Lannister forces, the Night's Watch and the Bog Devils.
 - Possibly revised list of Archers and a better explanation of what it means.
 - Evaluating the history of Archery (if any) in Westeros.
 - More on the Summer Islanders, Ghiscari, Dothraki and other Essosi and Sothyrosi archers.</p>

<p>Why are they afraid of white walkers? I don't know that they are. Where did you get that impression? I think actually that most people of Westeros consider the Others mythical creatures that don't really exist. The white walkers have not been seen for thousands of years, and people have forgotten. </p>

<p>That is not to say, of course, that people do not fear them, because they appear in mythology and ""ghost stories"", such as those told by Old Nan from Winterfell. But of course, grown-ups don't believe in ghosts, so there you have it.</p>

  <p>She had been born on Dragonstone nine moons after their flight, while a raging summer storm threatened to rip the island fastness apart. They said that storm was terrible. The Targaryen fleet was smashed while it lay at anchor, and huge stone blocks were ripped from the parapets and sent hurtling into the wild waters of the narrow sea. <strong>Her mother had died birthing her, and for that her brother Viserys had never forgiven her.</strong><br>

<p>As for why there are such large age gaps well Rhaella had a lot of trouble giving birth with some stillborns and some dying not long after being born. Also Aerys is said to have slept around a lot so his <em>attention</em> was not always on his wife which may have caused problems.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sadly, the marriage between Aerys II Targaryen and his sister, Rhaella, was not as happy; though she turned a blind eye to most of the king's infidelities, the queen did not approve of his ""turning my ladies into his whores."" (Joanna Lannister was not the first lady to be dismissed abruptly from Her Grace's service, nor was she the last). Relations between the king and queen grew even more strained when <strong>Rhaella proved unable to give Aerys any further children.

<p>Aemon Steelsong was son of Mance Rayder and his Queen Dalla. Mance was a deserter from Night's Watch so their son would fall under the category of children sired by Black brothers after taking their oath.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Iron Emmett grimaced. &quot;Men are men, vows are words, and words are
wind.&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>ADWD- Jon VII</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many of them frequent brothels such as Mole Town so naturally there would be a number of Black Bastards running around in Mole's Town although none are mentioned specifically IIRC. It's only logical that If a certain number of Black brothers are wenching, there's bound to be some fruits of that copulation. There's a proper term for it on the Wall, they call it &quot;digging for treasures&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ghost loped ahead of them. The grounds seemed deserted this morning,
with so <strong>many rangers off at the brothel in Mole's Town, digging for</strong>
<strong>buried treasure</strong> and drinking themselves blind. Grenn had gone with
them. Pyp and Halder and Toad had offered to buy him his first woman
to celebrate his first ranging. They'd wanted Jon and Sam to come as
well, but Sam was almost as frightened of whores as he was of the
haunted forest, and Jon had wanted no part of it. &quot;Do what you want,&quot;
he told Toad, &quot;I took a vow.&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>ACOK- Jon I</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it must be noted that Mole Town is frequented only by Castle Black men. It is unknown if their comrades stationed at Eastwatch or Shadow Tower have similar establishments nearby.</p>
<h3>Punishment for breaking the vows of celibacy</h3>
<p>You are correct they are breaking their vows. It is unknown what punishment did the Night's Watch of the old pass for such oath breakers but now, with the strength very much dwindled, it appears that Lord Commanders and Castle Commanders turn a blind eye to these minor breaches of their oath.</p>
<p>We have one example when Jon tried to desert his post to fight beside Robb but was brought back by his friends.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jon stood tall. He told himself that he would die well; that much he
could do, at the least. &quot;<strong>I know the penalty for desertion, my lord.
I'm not afraid to die.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nor live, I hope,&quot; Mormont said, cutting his ham with a dagger and
feeding a bite to the bird. &quot;You have not deserted—yet. Here you
stand. <strong>If we beheaded every boy who rode to Mole's Town in the
night, only ghosts would guard the Wall</strong>. Yet maybe you mean to flee
again on the morrow, or a fortnight from now. Is that it? Is that your
hope, boy?&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>AGOT- Jon IX</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now of course, Desertion is still a breach which is not dealt with kindness or benign negligence by the Watch, contrary to how they treat breach of celibacy vows. So here, it looks like Lord Commander was going to treat it as if Jon had gone to dig for the treasures. But it is not explicitly mentioned, this is just how you can interpret it. Alternatively, it could be just that Lord Commander was going to pretend that Jon had gone for ride to get some air.</p>
<p>Jon was however a firmer Lord Commander when his turn came. Few Black brothers mistook the Tower housing Wildling women for a brothel and Jon locked them in ice cells.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Hardin's Tower.&quot; Of the sixty-three who had come back with him from
Mole's Town, nineteen had been women and girls. Jon had housed them in
the same abandoned tower where he had once slept when he had been new
to the Wall. Twelve were spearwives, more than capable of defending
both themselves and the younger girls from the unwanted attentions of
black brothers. It was some of the men they'd turned away who'd given
Hardin's Tower its new, inflammatory name. Jon was not about to
condone the mockery. <strong>&quot;Three drunken fools mistook Hardin's for a
brothel, that's all. They are in the ice cells now, contemplating
their mistake.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Iron Emmett grimaced. &quot;Men are men, vows are words, and words are
wind. You should put guards around the women.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And who will guard the guards?&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>ADWD- Jon VII</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But admittedly Jon was dealing with attempted rape by the looks of it, something which even previous Lord Commanders wouldn't have tolerated. Mole's Town Women were different, it was consensual business between adults.</p>
<p>We however have example of punishment from a similar order with similar vows. The Kingsguard swear similar vows of celibacy. One of them, Ser Lucamore the Lusty was gelded and sent to the Wall for breaking his vows of celibacy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Yes, and what of Lucamore the Lusty, with his three wives and sixteen
children? The song always makes me laugh.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The truth is not so funny. He was never called Lucamore the Lusty
whilst he lived. His name was Ser Lucamore Strong, and his whole life
was a lie. <strong>When his deceit was discovered, his own Sworn Brothers</strong>
<strong>gelded him, and the Old King sent him to the Wall</strong>. Those sixteen
children were left weeping. He was no true knight, no more than
Terrence Toyne . . .&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>AFFC- The Soiled Knight</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another Ser Terrence Toyne was executed for breaking his vows with King's own mistress.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And Ser Terrence Toyne?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Bedded the king's mistress and died screaming</strong>. The lesson is, men who
wear white breeches need to keep them tightly laced.&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>AFFC- Jaime II</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that doesn't mean that Kingsguard is as perfect as Singers say. Many of them are no strangers to Street of Silk and some like Prince Lewyn had their own proper paramours. None were punished or tried.</p>
<p>So speculating, it appears that guilty members:</p>
<ol>
<li>May be gelded</li>
<li>May be executed</li>
<li>May be left alone</li>
</ol>
<p>All of these things depend on the temperament of the Commander and needs of the order.</p>

"170415","What happens to the animals in winter?","<p>I recognize that there are a few discussions on here already about how humans can properly survive a multi-year winter on Planetos, but I've not yet seen one about the animals. Note that my question is totally notwithstanding the possible conversion of animals into wight-imals.  </p>

<p>Specifically, thinking of the fact that even animals in our world end up often hibernating for a few months during the worst of the winter, and all the animals able to be active in the winter are specially adapted for doing so, I'm wondering how it is that common animals such as deer and birds which are not adapted for polar conditions can find enough food and warmth to get through multiple years of winter (especially the ones that last a decade or more).  </p>

<p>Carnivores would probably have it good for a while, but I don't see herbivores lasting long without ample plant life, and carnivores won't last long without herbivores.  </p>

<p>I've read the whole series several times, and am aware of no real discussion of how wild animals manage. Perhaps something in a world book or interview? I'd prefer a book answer, but if this was mentioned in the TV show then I suppose that would be interesting as well.  </p>

<p>So we see that during the long winters that people must move south to survive or starve. This would be because the animals (the food source) has done the same.

Knowing only the TV show, such behaviour seems a little bit ""jumpy"".</p>
","<game-of-thrones><character-development>","34508","<p>My view is that I don't think he is easily convinced as such - but instead arrives at his most of his actions through a combination of emotion (that overrides reason), a sense of entitlement and his own selfish desires. His character is motivated primarily by bis own pride and ambition as the heir apparent of the Iron Islands. But just as importantly, he is ignorant of his own people (the Ironborn) and The Old Ways by which they live. This is clearly shown by the scene in which Theon meets his father for the first time since he was taken away to live with the Starks; Balon is disgusted by what his son has become - he denigrates Theon for wearing gold jewellery that he has not paid ""the Iron Price"" for (i.e. seized by force/stolen). At this point, Balon essentially disinherited his son and wanted nothing to do with him. This ignorances pay a key part in the mistakes that Theon makes.</p>

<p>This is because Theon's upbringing with the Starks has instilled in him different values to the Ironborn, as such he not only does not follow the Old Ways but also believes firmly in his right by birth to rule the Iron Islands, an idyllic notion which does not reflect the harsh realities of life away from the mainlands. Confused by his father's repudiation of his only surviving son, Theon endeavours to prove himself and win back his favour in the only way he knows how - working against the Starks. The tragedy of Theon's situation is that he fails to see the consequences of his actions - that he has little to gain, and everything to lose - and as such sets himself down a path that can only bring him sorrow through the destruction of the North (which he feels conflicted about - as although his hosts may never have loved him, he is dimly aware that they did treat him well, and indeed he later has trouble with the idea of harming his foster brothers precisely because of this reason) and no joy, for the people of the Iron Islands do not (and cannot, given Theon's years as a hostage) respect him and he can never hope to overcome the obstacles to his fulfilling what he sees as his right to rule them. </p>

<p>As such, although Theon does despicable things, and his pride and selfishness is his downfall, it is not too hard to feel sorry for him in my opinion. As I say his situation is very tragic, his problems stemming largely from his conflicted emotions rather than any sense of cold cunning or reasoned planning, which sets him apart from most of the other villains of the series as I see it. </p>

"103477","Why did Stannis join the rebellion?","<p>We know that before the story of ASOIAF begins, Robert's Rebellion has toppled the Targaryen Dynasty and crowned Robert of House Baratheon to sit on the Iron Throne.</p>

<p>Stannis is described (more so in the books than in the tv-series) as having a strong sense of justice.  He even killed his younger brother Renly because he felt it was just and right for himself to become king over his younger brother.  It also goes to show family loyalty isn't high on his values but more likely, he sees family loyalty as a just and right thing to do, unless there is a more just and right thing.</p>

<p>So my question is <strong>Why did Stannis join the rebellion?</strong></p>

<p>Should he not have sided with the Targaryen because they were the rightful rulers of Westeros?  Even if he believed what Aerys II Targaryen (the Mad King) did to trigger the Rebellion was unjust, would he not have still supported Prince Rhaegar?  Or is it more important to stay loyal to his elder brother?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","103485","<p>Ser Davos actually asks Stannis this question directly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It is every man’s duty to remain loyal to his rightful king, even if

  brooked no argument.</p>
  
  <p>A desperate folly took hold of Davos, a
  recklessness akin to madness. “As you remained loyal to King Aerys
  when your brother raised his banners?” he blurted...</p>
  
  <p>“Aerys, If you
  only knew... that was a hard choosing. My blood or my liege. My
  brother or my king.” He grimaced. “Have you ever seen the Iron Throne?
  The barbs along the back, the ribbons of twisted steel, the jagged
  ends of swords and knives all tangled up and melted? It is not a
  comfortable seat, ser. Aerys cut himself so often men took to calling
  him King Scab, and Maegor the Cruel was murdered in that chair. By
  that chair, to hear some tell it. It is not a seat where a man can
  rest at ease. Ofttimes I wonder why my brothers wanted it so
  desperately.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see, he kind of trails off towards the end. But if we assume that his musing on the difficulty of ruling, Maegor's murder, and Aerys' incompetence wasn't random, I think it gives us our answer.</p>

<p>Stannis chose Robert because he believed, first and foremost, that his duty was to the realm. Aerys insanity and paranoia tore the realm apart by murdering lords on a whim and demanding Ned and Robert's heads. His brother was a strong charismatic young man who commanded the loyalty of all who met him. In Stannis' reckoning, his oaths to Robert and Aerys equaled out, but it was Robert who was best-suited to weather the hardness of the Iron Throne.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, Stannis says several times that he does not even want the Iron Throne. The reason he wages his war is he believes that the Others will soon attack the realm, and he is the only one who can lead the Seven Kingdoms to victory. If Stannis is willing to entertain kinslaying and black magic the good of the realm, is defying a Mad King for the same reason so dishonorable?</p>

<p>Other than what Mooz has answered, we have:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lord Luthor Tyrell's widow Lady Olenna Tyrell nee Redwyne</li>
<li>Lord Halys Hornwood's widow Lady Donella Hornwood nee Manderly</li>
<li>Lord Eddard's widow Lady Catelyn Stark nee Tully</li>
</ol>
<p>There are however no fixed rules about names of married women. We see some ladies who take their Lord Husbands' names and then we see some who retain their own names. <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/129717/54887"">Queens as a rule, never take their husband's name</a>. Of course in case of widows, it appears they may carry their dead Lord's name as long as they do not marry again. For example, Catelyn would be Catelyn Frey had she married Lord Frey after Ned's death.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It must happen,&quot; said Catelyn, though not gladly. &quot;I have no more
wish to suffer Walder Frey's insults and complaints than you do,
Brother, but I see little choice here. Without this wedding, Robb's
cause is lost. Edmure, we must accept.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We must accept?&quot; he echoed peevishly. &quot;<strong>I don't see you offering to
become the ninth Lady Frey, Cat.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>The eighth Lady Frey is still alive and well, so far as I know</strong>,&quot;
she replied. Thankfully. Otherwise it might well have come to that,
knowing Lord Walder.<br><sub><em><strong>ASOS - Catelyn IV</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Donella Hornwood would become Donella Manderly if she married one of the Manderlys:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Midday came and went. Maester Luwin sent Poxy Tym down to the
kitchens, and they dined in the solar on cheese, capons, and brown
oatbread. While tearing apart a bird with fat fingers, <strong>Lord Wyman
made polite inquiry after Lady Hornwood, who was a cousin of his. &quot;She
was born a Manderly, you know. Perhaps, when her grief has run its
course, she would like to be a Manderly again, eh?&quot;</strong> He took a bite
from a wing, and smiled broadly. &quot;As it happens, I am a widower these
past eight years. Past time I took another wife, don't you agree, my
lords? A man does get lonely.&quot; Tossing the bones aside, he reached for
a leg. &quot;Or if the lady fancies a younger lad, well, my son Wendel is
unwed as well. He is off south guarding Lady Catelyn, but no doubt he
will wish to take a bride on his return. A valiant boy, and jolly.
Just the man to teach her to laugh again, eh?&quot; He wiped a bit of
grease off his chin with the sleeve of his tunic.<br><sub><em><strong>ACOK - Bran II</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Matrilineal Marriages</h3>
<p>There is no such thing as a matrilineal marriage in Westeros.</p>
<p>Children born of a marriage can take name of either one of their parents, overwhelming majority prefers their father's name. However if it's the mother who is a landed noble and father who's a mere consort, Children take name of their mother e.g. Princes of Dornes.</p>
<p>A man can change his surname to another dynasty's if:</p>
<ol>
<li>He is married to a woman of that dynasty</li>
<li>He is descended from a woman of that dynasty</li>
</ol>
<p>For point #1, we see King Joffrey Lannister, born as Joffrey Lydden. His wife was the only daughter of King Gerold III Lannister. When Gerold died, it was Joffrey who took the throne as Joffrey Lannister by right of marriage. That's when House Lannister changed from First-Man stock to Andal stock.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In time, Lannister kings wed their children to Andals as well; indeed,
<strong>when Gerold III died without male issues, a council crowned his only daughter's husband, Ser Joffery Lydden, who took the Lannister name</strong>
and became the first Andal to rule the Rock.<br><sub><em><strong>TWOIAF - The Westerlands</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Point #2, we see examples of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Beren_Tallhart"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Beren Tallhart</a>. Beren was son of Berena Hornwood, sister to late Lord Halys Hornwood. When Lord Halys died with heir and only son therefore extinguishing House Hornwood in male line, Beren's father proposed to Winterfell that if Beren is named heir to Hornwood lands, he will take Hornwood name so that the house could continue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I will, ser,&quot; said Leobald, and only then raised the matter of Lady
Hornwood. Poor thing, with no husband to defend her lands nor son to
inherit. <strong>His own lady wife was a Hornwood, sister to the late Lord
Halys</strong>, doubtless they recalled. &quot;An empty hall is a sad one. I had a
thought to send my younger son to Lady Donella to foster as her own.
<strong>Beren is near ten, a likely lad, and her own nephew. He would cheer her, I am certain, and perhaps he would even take the name Hornwood</strong>
. . .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If he were named heir?&quot; suggested Maester Luwin.</p>
<p>&quot;. . . so the House might continue,&quot; finished Leobald.<br><sub><em><strong>ACOK - Bran II</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other than facts, there are also Wilding traditions suggesting that House Stark's senior male line died long ago and current Starks are descended from a female Stark and a wildling King Bael the Bard. As per their story,  Lord <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Brandon_Stark_(the_daughterless)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Brandon Stark</a> fathered no children except a daughter. The daughter was supposedly abducted by King Beyond the Wall, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bael_the_Bard"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bael the Bard</a>. Brandon was distraught because this meant extinction of House Stark. But later the girl was found with a child fathered by Bael. That child was brought up as a Stark and succeeded his grandfather upon his death. For details, click <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/134179/54887"">here</a>.</p>

"170728","What was written in the book Sam was reading with the Valyrian steel dagger?","<p>In Game of Thrones Season 07 Episode 01, ""Dragonstone"", Sam finds out that there is a mountain of Dragonglass underneath Dragonstone. Whilst searching through the book one of the pages has a picture of the Valyrian steel dagger that the Catspaw used to try and kill Bran with.</p>

<p>What is written on that page? Does any of it have any relevance to that particular dagger?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><object-identification>","170729","<p>I have found an image that shows the page quite clearly:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7RzoO.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/7RzoO.jpg"" alt=""Image page""></a></p>

<p>The text appears to say, I have taken this off of the <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Valyrian_steel_dagger"" rel=""noreferrer"">wikia</a> but it does appear to be accurate:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Valyrians were familiar with dragonglass long before they came to Westeros. They called it ""zīrtys perzys"" which translated to “frozen fire” in Valyrian and eastern tales tell of how their dragons would thaw the stone with dragonflame until it became molten and malleable. The Valyrians then used it to build their strange monuments and building without seams and joints of our modern castles.
  <br>When Aegon the conqueror forged his Seven Kingdoms, he and his descendants would often <strong>decorate their blades with dragonglass</strong> feeling a kinship with the stone. The royal fashion for dragonglass ornamentation soon spread throughout the Seven Kingdoms to those wealthy enough to afford it. <strong>Hilts and pommels were and are the most common decoration for dragonglass</strong> if too brittle to make a useful crossguard. Indeed, its very brittleness is what relegate it to the great houses and the most successful merchants.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the only significance appears to be that it was once a Targaryen blade as it seems to be decorated in the same fashion as described in the book.</p>

<p>However, there may be more to it than that as apparently <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-star-confirms-the-show-wanted-you-to-notice-something_us_596e1595e4b010d77673da05"" rel=""noreferrer"">John Bradley, Sam, was told to linger on that page</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I was told very little about that. When we were shooting that scene, I was literally told make sure that you linger on this page. They were shooting over my shoulder and said make sure to linger on this page. Make sure we get a good shot of this page before you turn the page over,” Bradley said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s all part of the same universe,” Bradley told HuffPost about that moment, “and all of these storylines, no matter how spread out they feel sometimes, they are a lot of the same storyline and in the equation ... and if you think you saw something you probably did see something. It may not be what you thought you saw, but it just kind of feeds into this idea that [showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss] have a plan, and they are playing the long game, and they are gonna plant the seeds.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The blade Joff chose was <strong>nice and plain. No goldwork, no jewels in the hilt, no silver inlay on the blade</strong>. King Robert never wore it, had likely forgotten he owned it. Yet the Valyrian steel was deadly sharp . . . sharp enough to slice through skin, flesh, and muscle in one quick stroke. I am no stranger to Valyrian steel. But he had been, hadn't he? Else he would never have been so foolish as to pick Littlefinger's knife.

<p>However, in the show the blade is obviously fancy and goes against this description.</p>

<p><div class=""youtube-embed""><div>
                <iframe width=""640px"" height=""395px"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/4nWeC2tmrHw?start=0""></iframe>
            </div></div></p>

<p>In the paragraph above Tyrion describes Joff's own dagger:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <strong>prince's own dagger had a jeweled pommel and inlaid goldwork on the blade</strong>, Tyrion seemed to recall. At least Joff had not been stupid enough to use that. Instead he went poking among his father's weapons. Robert Baratheon was a man of careless generosity, and would have given his son any dagger he wanted . . . but Tyrion guessed that the boy had just taken it. Robert had come to Winterfell with a long tail of knights and retainers, a huge wheelhouse, and a baggage train. No doubt some diligent servant had made certain that the king's weapons went with him, in case he should desire any of them.

</blockquote>

<p>Note that <a href=""http://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2013/06/02/swords-for-sale/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GRRM also thinks the dagger is different in the show</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A handsome blade, I think. Though rather completely different from the dagger in the books, which was far plainer (though made of Valryian steel, with a dragonbone grip).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did the show intend for the Catspaw dagger to actually be Joffery's or did they make a mistake in the props department?</p>

<p>The question is essentially: why was the dagger in the show fancy when in the books it is plain?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><adaptation-comparison>","170742","<p>I would imagine that it was simply to distinguish it from other, regular daggers.</p>

<p>The Valyrian Steel dagger is referenced many times in the first book/ season, and is the catalyst for almost every major political thing that happens until Ned's death.</p>

<p>It is used when attempting to assassinate Bran, it is used as the justification for Catelyn arresting Tyrion, Littlefinger puts it to Ned's throat just as he betrays him.</p>

<p>In the books, it is easy to describe it as a ""Valyrian Steel"" dagger, which immediately makes it special without us having to see it, yet it being plain allows for the excuse of Joffrey selecting it to order Bran's death.</p>

<p>But for these occurrences to have as much significance in the show, it really can't appear as a dagger that is just a regular dagger unless inspected closely. Otherwise it would be much harder to justify to the audience how it is so recognizable, or have as much of an emotional impact for each of these moments.</p>

<p>If I remember correctly (though I might be wrong), the issue of Tyrion tracing it back to Joffrey is not done in the same way in the show as it was in the book, i.e. realizing that it was Robert's knife and assuming that Joffrey chose it mistaking it for a normal weapon.</p>

"103692","What methods to reproduce/copy books are available in the world of Game of Thrones / ASOIAF?","<p>I am wondering what methods to reproduce or copy books are available on the work of Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire).</p>

<p>I been trying to do some research (Google, Game of Thrones wikis, this site), but with keywords like ""books"" and ""copy"" I only get results about number of copies of the series sold or printed or the like. I haven't been able to find anything reading about <em>maesters</em> or <em>The Citadel</em> on the Internet.</p>

<p>I haven't read the books, only watched the show. I wonder if this is ever addressed in the books, since George R.R. Martin's worlds tend to be pretty detailed and consistent. In the tv show this is of course not addressed at all, and apart from Sam's love for books, or Ser Davos learning to read the only other reference I can recall about books is Tyrion giving a very special tome to Joffrey for his wedding. This was supposed to be a very expensive and unique book. I don't know it if was so due to its content or due to how difficult it was to reproduce such tome.</p>

<p>Is it known (mentioned or referenced in the novels) how are all these books (re)produced? Does anything like Gutenberg's print exist in Westeros (or anywhere in the world of A Song of Ice and Fire)? Are all books copied ""by hand"" by certain people (at <em>The Citadel</em> or wherever)?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","103830","<p>Since there are no photocopiers in the world of a song of ice and fire. We can assume that copies were created by hand. There are couple of quote which indicate the same:</p>

"170911","Do we ever find out who sent the catspaw after Bran in the show?","<p><a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/181067/58193"">In the books</a> we learn that Joffery Baratheon, most likely, sent the catspaw to kill Bran Stark in an attempt to impress his ""father"", Robert Baratheon. This is first worked out by Tyrion Lannister:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He remembered a cold morning when he'd climbed down the steep exterior steps from Winterfell's library to find <strong>Prince Joffrey jesting with the Hound about killing wolves</strong>. Send a dog to kill a wolf, he said. Even Joffrey was not so foolish as to command Sandor Clegane to slay a son of Eddard Stark, however; the Hound would have gone to Cersei. Instead the boy found his catspaw among the unsavory lot of freeriders, merchants, and camp followers who'd attached themselves to the king's party as they made their way north. Some poxy lackwit willing to risk his life for a prince's favor and a little coin. Tyrion wondered whose idea it had been to wait until Robert left Winterfell before opening Bran's throat. <strong>Joff's, most like</strong>. No doubt he thought it was the height of cunning.
  <br>...
  <br>The blade Joff chose was nice and plain. No goldwork, no jewels in the hilt, no silver inlay on the blade. King Robert never wore it, had likely forgotten he owned it. Yet the Valyrian steel was deadly sharp . . . sharp enough to slice through skin, flesh, and muscle in one quick stroke. <strong>I am no stranger to Valyrian steel. But he had been, hadn't he?</strong> Else he would never have been so foolish as to pick Littlefinger's knife. 
  <br>The why of it still eluded him. Simple cruelty, perhaps? His nephew had that in abundance. It was all Tyrion could do not to retch up all the wine he'd drunk, piss in his breeches, or both. He squirmed uncomfortably. He ought to have held his tongue at breakfast. The boy knows I know now. My big mouth will be the death of me, I swear it.
  <br><sub>A Storm of Swords, Tyrion VIII</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the books, as quoted above, we also learn that Joffery hadn't really known about Valyrian steel at the point he sent the catspaw. The only quote I can find in the show that resembles this, and it is a bit far-fetched, is the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Careful, Your Grace. Nothing cuts like Valyrian steel.
  <br>So they say.
  <br><sub>Game of Thrones, S04 E02, ""The Lion and the Rose""</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>With Joffery's cocky attitude it could imply that he already knows about Valyrian steel at this point although not really having come into contact with it before. Except Ice when it was taken from Ned Stark but I interpret that comment to be more aimed towards the dagger in a backward kind of way to reference the quote from Tyrion in the books.</p>

<p>Later on Jaime and Cersei Lannister also appear to come to the same conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robert? Jaime had guarded the king long enough to know that Robert Baratheon said things in his cups that he would have denied angrily the next day. ""Were you alone when Robert said this?""
  <br>""You don't think he said it to Ned Stark, I hope? Of course we were alone. Us and the children."" Cersei removed her hairnet and draped it over a bedpost, then shook out her golden curls. ""Perhaps Myrcella sent this man with the dagger, do you think so?""
  <br>It was meant as mockery, but she'd cut right to the heart of it, <strong>Jaime saw at once. ""Not Myrcella. Joffrey.""</strong>
  <br>Cersei frowned. ""Joffrey had no love for Robb Stark, but the younger boy was nothing to him. He was only a child himself.""
  <br>""A child hungry for a pat on the head from that sot you let him believe was his father."" He had an uncomfortable thought. ""Tyrion almost died because of this bloody dagger. If he knew the whole thing was Joffrey's work, that might be why . . .""
  <br><sub>A Storm of Swords, Jaime IX</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, the <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Valyrian_steel_dagger"" rel=""noreferrer"">wikia for the show</a> seems to suggest that Petyr Baelish was the one who sent the assassin:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During the trial, it is deduced that the dagger did in fact belong to Baelish all along, suggesting that he was the one who sent the catspaw assassin to kill Bran in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The quote this appears to go off of is the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You told our mother this knife belonged to Tyrion Lannister. But that was another one of your lies. <strong>It was yours.</strong>
  <br><sub>Game of Thrones, S07 E07, ""The Dragon and the Wolf""</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This appears to be a bit of a stretch and there's no actual evidence that Petyr owned the dagger beforehand, the wikia doesn't even state him in the list of owners before the catspaw. It appears as if Sansa is saying it as too add to the ""evidence"" for why Petyr is going to be given the sentence he is given. Even if the dagger was Petyr's it doesn't even mean that he sent the catspaw too.</p>

<p>So, do we ever learn who sent the catspaw?</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>Note: I've tagged with the books as my question uses evidence from the books but I am interested in show only answers.</sup></p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","171059","<p>It appears as though the show has left it ambiguous on purpose and hasn't explicitly stated who it was so far.</p>

"103769","What was the Night's Watch protecting before the White Walkers?","<p>So we know from <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/91731/53573"">this excellent answer</a> that the <strong>Night's King</strong> was the 13th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, and that he fell in love with an Other/White Walker female, and somehow (yet to be told) transformed into an Other as well and became their King.</p>

<p>What I'm not understanding is this: why was there even a ""Night's Watch"" in the first place, before the Night's King and before the threat of Others/White Walkers was even known?</p>

<p><strong>What were the earliest Night's Watchmen protecting the realms from before the Night's King?</strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones>","103774","<p>There was no Night's Watch before the White Walkers.</p>

<p>The chronology of the days when the White Walkers first appeared is a bit murky, but we know that the Nights Watch was formed <em>in response</em> to them; Bran also built the Wall specifically to keep them out.</p>

<p>The First Men and the Children of the Forest initially joined forces to fight off The Others, including forming the Night's Watch to keep them at bay. Once the Others had been driven back far enough North, Bran the Builder built the Wall, with the Children's help, and set the Watch to guard it.</p>

<p>It was only later, after the Wall was built, that the Night's King came along. (Also, to be technical, we don't <em>know</em> that he fell in love with an Other, we're making that assumption based on the strong similarities in her description. There's another in-universe theory that she was the daughter of one of the Barrowmen). Eventually, he declared himself king, and was defeated by the Kings south of the Wall. As far as I know, he was never considered a ""leader"" of The Others (he was working with them in secret, similar to how Crastor was). That information only came out after his death.</p>

<hr>

<p>I should mention that the leader of the White Walkers is referred to as ""the Night King"" in the show, that's <em>not</em> the same character as ""the Night's King"". Both appear to exist in the TV continuity, as Ygritte recites the following story of the Free Folk on one of the DVD extras from the Second Season DVD:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>About how one of your king crows found something cold in the woods... with bright blue eyes. How he brought her home, through your wall, and declared himself ""Night's King"". [...] With the help of the Starks, we killed the demon and cleansed your precious watch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the show, the ""Night King"" is the name given to the first White Walker, who now leads them. In the novels, the Others have only appeared rarely, and there's no mention yet of any command structure, leader, etc.</p>

<p>Why did he think so? I know Robb was supposed to marry one of Walder Frey's daughters, but what did he <em>really</em> lose by marrying Talisa? </p>

<p>He was promised to one of the Frey girls in exchange for crossing the bridge, but now that's irrelevant. </p>

<p>It also doesn't look like he had many of Frey's men to begin with, since in Season 3 Episode 5, ""Kissed by Fire"", he considers asking for their help to replace a chunk of his army. Additionally, it doesn't look like Frey's army is that large; Robb's army outnumbered Frey's five to one when they crossed Twins.</p>

<p>So why did Karstark believe the war was lost when Robb married Talisa?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","34853","<p>It's more than that. Supply lines, and 3000 troops were also on the line. Robb was far from home, and needed all the help he could get, especially as far as troops and supplies. In addition, no one could fully trust him after he broke the treaty. </p>

<p>The Twins was one of the most powerful strongholds in Westeros, and overall was a very powerful location. Their leader, Walder Frey, is a powerful man, with a quick temper, and without much to lose, thus willing to do anything to get back against the perceived injustice. </p>

<p>Is there anything in either <em>Game of Thrones</em> or <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> that explains why Jeor left his family to join the Night's Watch, and when in his lifetime he did so?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","171075","<h2>Why</h2>
<p>We're not told when and why, but we can make a guess.</p>
<p>It's possible he wanted to give his seat to his son, Jorah, and handed his blade Longclaw to him before his departure. After Jorah shamed himself and his house, he sent Longclaw back to his father in the Night's Watch.</p>

<p>&quot;The Watch has no shortage of stableboys,&quot; Lord Mormont grumbled. &quot;That seems to be all they send us these days.

<p>From the above, it's worth noting that Jon was born at the end of Robert's Rebellion and was not brought back to Winterfell till <em>after</em> the Rebellion.</p>
<p>So we know he was in the Night's Watch from at least around 14 years before the events of ASOS, and we know he'd left after Jorah was wed and before the Greyjoy Rebellion.</p>

Seeing an opportunity both Houses Tarbeck and Reyne rose in rebellion against their liege lord. By then Tywin had had enough. He personally led the campaign against the rebels. He was so vicious that both houses were completely extinguished and their seats put to the torch.

<p>The politics of medieval Germany also strongly remind me of Westeros. It was a country splintered into many different houses just like in the series.</p>

<p>But was the marriage cancelled ? How is that possible ? Tysha surely wasn't a virgin, and nothing is said about her being dead.</p>

<p><strong>So, my question: Did they just divorce? Is that possible? Or maybe Sansa'a marriage with Tyrion is not valid?</strong></p>

This is not the same as divorce, since it is considered that the couple have never been properly married at all.</p>

<li>Valyrian Steel- This has been speculated, but never definitively proved. It was a discussion between Sam and Jon at the beginning of book 4 (And book 5) where this revelation came to play. <strong>Update</strong>: in episode ""Hardhome"" of season 5, it is shown that Valyrian steel can kill the White Walkers: Jon Snow kills one using his sword Longclaw.

<p>At the very end of the second season, Sam is surrounded by a bunch of wights, and the White Walker which looks at him doesn't kill him. It does not happen this way in the books. I can't explain this part. Maybe the White Walker looked at the rock which Sam was hiding behind, and not directly at Sam.</p>

  season of television. We have so many storylines to juggle, and they
  all need to ideally have a sense of a beginning, middle and end over
  the course of a season. Each character needs to feel like they're
  traveling a specific road in the course of a season, and coming out as
  a different person than they went in. It's never going to be about

"36300","Archery on the Wall [Spoilers]","<p>The wall in a song of ice and fire is roughly 700 feet tall. During the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_Castle_Black"">battle of castle Black</a>, Jon Snow and the other brothers of the Night's Watch exchange arrow fire with wildlings on the ground. The wildling archers repeatedly hit the straw-men Jon Snow puts up as a distraction. So my questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Would it be possible to accurately hit an enemy from the top of the wall, given its height?</p></li>
<li><p>Would it be possible to accurately hit an enemy on top of the wall from the ground, as the wildlings do?</p></li>
</ol>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><game-of-thrones>","36301","<p><strong>Yes. The Great Wall of Westeros is 700 feet or 213 meters tall. On the face of it, it seems within the realm of plausibility to shoot and hit targets at that range.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Looking at formulas for arrows and distance, the most important factor is the amount of force that can be applied to the arrow. Expect to see large bows (long bows, recurve bows) being used in such fight scenes because they are the only bows capable of generating the force required.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Most bow hunters shoot at targets averaging 35 to 75 meters away. Target archers can shoot at ranges of 100 -200 meters. These distances are considering negligible elevation. Shooting at elevate targets reduce range.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Using an advanced technology recurve bow might stretch target shooting to 225 to 250 meters. It takes an extraordinary archer to hit anything further than 200 meters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>So, is it possible to shoot from the top of the Wall of Westeros.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Yes. The archer shooting down has the advantage of gravity working in his favor... The archer on the ground is at a distinct disadvantage but if there are enough of them, that might not matter as much.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Is it possible to hit anything effectively at that distance? A highly-trained, well-equipped archer has a decent chance to hit anything from either position.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Are there examples of long range bow shooting?</strong></p>
<p>The longest arrow flight until recently was 350 meters. Arrows shot this distance are not trying to hit a target. They are trying to cross distances. In the news on Tuesday, August 24, 2010:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Zak Crawford, 14, who dreamed of being Robin Hood, shot an arrow nearly 500 metres — equal to the length of five football pitches — using a recurve bow, in the senior under-35lb class, at the Northern Counties Flight Championships - setting the new world record for the Longest bow and arrow shot. He broke the previous world record of 350 metres in senior category by using a recurve bow in the championship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why is this relevant?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>It shows that it is quite possible to launch arrows considerable distances. The limitations are in the strength of the bowman, the pull of the bow, the weight of the arrow, and the elevation of the target.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Elevation reduces range. Accuracy suffers for range but a range of 500 meters (1640 feet) gives credibility to the possibility of such archery being possible if a bit extraordinary.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_longbow#Range_and_penetration"" rel=""noreferrer"">The English Longbow</a> statistics (range and penetration) from Wikipedia:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>The range of the medieval weapon is not accurately known, with estimates from 165 to 228 m (180 to 249 yds). Modern longbows have a useful range up to 180 m (200 yd). A 667 N (150 lbf) Mary Rose replica longbow was able to shoot a 53.6 g (1.9 oz) arrow 328 m (360 yd) and a 95.9 g (3.3 oz) a distance of 249.9 m (272 yd).</p>
</li>
<li><p>A flight arrow of a professional archer of Edward III's time would reach 365 m (400 yd). It is also well known that no practice range was allowed to be less than 220 yds by order of Henry VIII.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The longbow was capable of long range, and was highly accurate at short range. Most of the longer-range shooting mentioned in stories was not marksmanship, but rather thousands of archers launching volleys of arrows at an army.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Longbowmen armies would shoot a rain of arrows landing indiscriminately in the target area. An archer could hit a person at 165 m (180 yards or 540 feet) &quot;part of the time&quot; and could always hit an army.</p>

<p>They have many commonalities.</p>
<p><strong>Royal Birth</strong></p>
<p>Both women were born into royal families.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleopatra the VII was born into the royal family of Philopator, one branch of which ruled Egypt as the Ptolemaic Dynasty.</li>
<li>Daenerys was born into the royal family of Targaryen, which ruled Westeros.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Foreign Origin of Family</strong></p>
<p>Both women's families were not from the nations they ruled.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleopatra's family was foreign to Egypt that came to rule the country after a conquest over 200 years earlier. Her ancestors founded the Ptolemaic dynasty. The Philopators were Greeks of Macedonian origin and ruled Egypt after Alexander the Great conquered Egypt.</li>
<li>Daenerys's family was foreign to Westeros that came to rule the country after a conquest over 200 years earlier. Her ancestors founded the Targaryen dynasty. They were of Valyrian origin.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sibling Marriage in Family</strong></p>
<p>Both women were from families that practiced sibling marriages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Brother-sister marriages were common in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_dynasty"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ptolemaic dynasty</a>. Seven of the 16 Ptolemaic kings married a sister. Another two kings each married two sisters. Cleopatra herself was married to not one, but two, of her brothers when she was a teenager. She later had armies fight against both of her co-ruling brother-husbands and conspired against each of them.</li>
<li>Brother-sister marriages were common in the Targaryen dynasty. Several Targaryen kings married their sisters, and the founder married two.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Death of Brother</strong></p>
<p>Both women were involved in the deaths of their brothers.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is believed that Cleopatra had <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_XIV_of_Egypt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">one of her brother-husbands</a> killed by poison for the benefit of her son, Caesarion.</li>
<li>Daenerys's brother, Viserys, was killed by her lover, Khal Drogo.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cruel Fathers</strong></p>
<p>Both women's fathers were known for cruelty towards their subjects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ancient Egyptians hated Cleopatra's father, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_XII_Auletes"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ptolemy XII</a>, for the cruelty he inflicted on them.</li>
<li>Daenerys's father, Aerys II, had people burnt alive.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Polyglot</strong></p>
<p>Both women spoke several languages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleopatra spoke nine languages fluently and rarely used an interpreter.</li>
<li>Daenerys speaks multiple languages (not sure how many), but used an interpreter to hide the fact that she understood what foreign rulers said about her.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exile</strong></p>
<p>Both women lived in exile.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleopatra was forced into exile as a teenager after military losses during the war against one of her brother-husbands.</li>
<li>Daenerys grew up in exile due to military losses against her father and brother before she was born.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conquest</strong></p>
<p>Both women returned from exile to conquer the kingdoms they were born to rule.</p>
<ul>
<li>At age 21, Cleopatra raised an army in exile and worked with foreign leaders to reconquer Egypt.</li>
<li>In her late teens or early 20's, Daenerys raised an army in exile and worked with foreign leaders in her attempt to reconquer Westeros.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In Battle</strong></p>
<p>Both women were present at important battles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleopatra was present at the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Actium"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Battle of Actium</a>, a decisive event that gave Rome supremacy over Egypt.</li>
<li>Daenerys participated in several battles using her dragons.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sexual Appeal</strong></p>
<p>Both women used their bodies to allure men to do their bidding.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cleopatra had herself smuggled into Julius Caesar's palace and then seduced him. She also seduced Marc Antony and several other powerful men.</li>
<li>Daenerys seduced several powerful men to further her political ambitions.</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems that the major differences between them are that one had dragons and the other did not, that one fought ice zombies and the other did not, and that one used blood magic, and the other did not.</p>
<p><strong>Did George R. R. Martin have Cleopatra in mind when he wrote chapters about Daenerys?</strong></p>
<p>I am looking for answers based on comments, writings, or interviews of the author.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><inspiration>","172281","<h1>Real Answer</h1>

<p>The answer is <strong>We do not know</strong>.</p>

<p>As far as I know, George has never talked about his inspiration behind Daenerys Targaryen, which of course we must note, there need not be any.</p>

<p>GRRM has however talked about what inspires him.</p>

<p>He has <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/950"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mentioned that</a> war of the Roses is one of the key influences on him:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The Wars of the Roses have always fascinated me, and certainly did influence A SONG OF ICE AND FIRE</strong>, but there's really no one-for-one
  character-for-character correspondence. I like to use history to
  flavor my fantasy, to add texture and versimillitude, but simply
  rewriting history with the names changed has no appeal for me. I
  prefer to reimagine it all, and take it in new and unexpected
  directions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And he also stated that It's the <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Historical_Influences/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">English and French history which are the core of his historical borrowings</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q: [Edited for clarity after this point. Ser Loras's (Ser Loras is the
  nickname of the fan) question concerning whether GRRM borrows from
  history, particularly Spanish history, received the reply below.]</p>
  
  <p>George: Well, yes and no. I have drawn on a great many influences for
  these books. I do use incidents from history, yes, although I try not
  to do a straight one-for-one transposition of fact into fiction. I
  prefer to mix and match, and to add in some imaginative elements as
  well.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Most of my borrowings, however, come from English and French medieval history, simply because I am more familiar with those than
  with the heroes, legends, and traditions of other countries.</strong> The
  Wars of the Roses, the Crusades, and the Hundred Years War have been
  my biggest influences... oh, and some Scottish history as well, such
  as the infamous Black Dinner that inspired my own Red Wedding. This
  isn't a matter of choice so much as it is one of necessity. <strong>I don't
  have any other language besides English, and there's a paucity of good
  popular English language histories about medieval Spain, medieval
  Germany, and the like</strong>. I was in Germany last fall, and looked
  everywhere for good reference books about the medieval Holy Roman
  Empire, which would be treasure trove, I suspect. There are a ton of
  them that looked likely... but all in German.</p>
  
  <p>And in about a week I will be travelling to Spain, coincidentally
  enough, where I plan to search for some good popular histories as
  well. Whether I will find any I can read, however... well, it's
  doubtful. </p>

<h1>Other similar historical characters</h1>

<p>There are however a number of similar historical characters other than  Cleopatra  who share something with Daenerys Targaryen.</p>

<h3><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VII_of_England"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Henry VII of England</a></h3>

<p>There are many who draw parallels between Henry VII Tudor and Daenerys I Targaryen. The core reasons are following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Both of them lived in Exile across the narrow sea (Or English channel).</li>
<li>Both lost their fathers in early age, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Tudor,_1st_Earl_of_Richmond"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Edmund</a> and Aerys.</li>
<li>Both of them are pitted against a usurper,  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_IV"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Edward IV</a> in Henry's case and Robert in Daenerys'.</li>
<li>Another usurper appears who removes the heirs of original usurper Edward IV/Robert Baratheon. That's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_III"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Richard III</a> and Joffrey Baratheon. </li>
<li>Both are the rightful heirs in eyes of some nobles. </li>
<li>Both used dragons on their banners.</li>
<li>Both had dissidents join them in exile.</li>
<li>Daenerys had Ser Barristan, Henry had <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_de_Vere,_13th_Earl_of_Oxford"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">John de Vere</a>, Earl of Oxford.</li>
<li>This fits with the author's area of historical expertise. GRRM has already stated that his core inspirations come from French and English history, particularly the war of Roses. </li>
</ol>

<h3><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abd_al-Rahman_I"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Abd el Rahman I ""The Falcon"" of Andalusia</a></h3>

<p>Personally, I see more of Abd el Rahman I Umayyad of Andalusia in her than Henry VII. </p>

<p>Here's why:</p>

<ol>
<li>Both were last scions of great dynasties, him the last of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banu_Umayya"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Umayyads</a> (At least he thought so at the time but later other members turned up like Aemon tried to reach Daenerys), her the last of the Targaryens. <br><br>🎶 <em>Oh I am the last of the Umayyads/Targaryens, my people are gone from the world. The last of the great Syrian/Westerosi Umayyads/Targaryens, who ruled half the world/Westeros at my birth.....They hunt me with dogs in the day light, they hunt me with torches by night. For these Abbasids/Baratheons who are small can never stand tall, whilst Umayyads/Targaryens still walk in the light.</em>🎶 <br><br></li>
<li>Both had their families ousted in popular rebellions.</li>
<li>Both lost their fathers early, He lost <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu%27awiya_ibn_Hisham"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Muawiyah</a>, she lost Aerys.</li>
<li>Both ran from their home with their brothers while their families were butchered.</li>
<li>Brothers of both Abd al-Rehman and Daenerys were killed.</li>
<li>Both ran for their lives, in fear.</li>
<li>Both then managed to carve themselves a Kingdom with no other strength than their own.</li>
<li>Both never forgot where they came from and always wanted to go back.
To go East (Damascus), Abd al-Rehman had to go West (Andalus). Daenerys was told by Quaithe that to go West (Westeros) she had to go east. He wanted to go East and fate kept taking him further and further West. She wants to go West but fate keeps taking her further and further East.</li>
<li>Both then decided to improve the affairs of their newly forged Kingdoms. So both of them stayed and ruled. Abd al-Rehman planted Date Palm trees, Daenerys planted olive trees.</li>
<li>Both were polyglots. </li>
</ol>

<p>On an unrelated note, regarding the Black Dinner being the inspiration for the Red Wedding, there's sort of a Black Dinner from this character's life too. After their rival family, Abbasids deposed the Umayyads, the new Caliph <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As-Saffah"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Abu al-Abbas</a> invited the members of the deposed dynasty who were still in the capital to a dinner. When the guests arrived, Abbasids had them all beaten to death with clubs before the first course. The table was set then on their corpses and Abu al-Abbas, henceforth known as As-Saffah (Blood-shedder) had dinner with his friends and Generals. </p>

<p>Abd el Rahman however never managed to return to take back his Grandfather's throne. He never managed to avenge his family. In the end he built a new Palace, named  and modeled after the Imperial Palace he was born in, al-Rusafa , and planted Palm Trees there so that he could give himself some solace that he was still home. </p>

<p>Here's a testimonial by one of his greatest enemies, the Caliph al-Mansur of Abbasid Empire, which should really summarise all the similarities between him and Daenerys.The Caliph asked his courtiers that who deserved the title of ""Falcon of Quraysh"" (Most capable man of the tribe of Quraysh). Courtiers replied that it would have to be the Caliph himself. He said no. Courtiers said then it would have to be Muawiya I (Founder of Umayyad Caliphate), the Caliph again said no. The courtiers then presented the name of Abd al-Malk (One of the greatest Umayyad Caliphs), the Caliph again said no. Courtiers asked then who might deserve the title? The Caliph replied:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The falcon of Quraysh is Abd al-Rahman, who escaped by his cunning the
  spearheads of the lances and the blades of the swords, who after
  wandering solitary through the deserts of Asia and Africa, had the
  boldness to seek his fortune without an army, in lands unknown to him
  beyond the sea. Having naught to rely upon save his own wits and
  perseverance, he nonetheless humiliated his proud foes, exterminated
  rebels, organized cities, mobilized armies, secured his frontiers
  against the Christians, founded a great empire and reunited under his
  scepter a realm that seemed already parcelled out among others. No man
  before him ever did such deeds. Mu'awiya rose to his stature through
  the support of Umar and Uthman, whose backing allowed him to overcome
  difficulties; Abd al-Malik, because of previous appointment; and the
  Commander of the Faithful [i.e. al-Mansur himself] through the
  struggle of his kin and the solidarity of his partisans. But Abd
  al-Rahman did it alone, with the support of none other than his own
  judgment, depending on no one but his own resolve.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He also wrote a beautiful poem for his trees. Translated version below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the midst of Rusafa</p>
  
  <p>Grows a palm-tree;</p>
  
  <p>Born in the West,</p>
  
  <p>Away from the country of palm-trees.   I cried: You are like me,</p>
  
  <p>For you resemble me</p>
  
  <p>In wandering and peregrination,</p>
  
  <p>And the long separation from kith and kin.   You also</p>
  
  <p>Grew up on a foreign soil;</p>
  
  <p>Like me,</p>
  
  <p>You are far from the country of your birth.   May the fertilizing
  clouds of morning</p>
  
  <p>Water you in exile,</p>
  
  <p>May the beneficent rains besought by the poor</p>
  
  <p>Never forsake you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And so ended the reign of Abd el-Rahman I of House Umayyad, called ""The Immigrant"" by his subjects and ""the Falcon"" by his foes. He built a realm that would be called ""Jewel of the World"", defeated his foes, provided a new home for his Kin where they would rule for centuries to come, crushed rebellions, united the Iberian peninsula, threw back invasions from North and South but he never got his heart's one true desire, Home!</p>

<h3><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boran"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pourandokht I of Persia</a></h3>

<p>The first woman to rule the Sassanian Empire had somethings in common with Daenerys as well, although not as much as the first two candidates:</p>

<ol>
<li>She lost her father and most of her family when a coup in favor of her brother Kavadh II ended in wholesale murder of the Imperial Family with the King and thirty of his sons being executed by the new King. </li>
<li>Kavadh died soon and Usurper <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahrbaraz"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Shahrbaraz</a> a Persian General then killed his minor son <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardashir_III"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ardeshir III</a> and claimed the throne for himself.</li>
<li>While it is unknown who was her mother, It is very possible that she was a product of incest as <a href=""http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/marriage-next-of-kin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">practice of Incest was considered holy by Zoroastrianism</a>. But if her mother was related to her father, then she'd be a proper wife, not a concubine and she would not have been unknown, as then she'd be a Persian Princess, not some random lowborn girl.</li>
</ol>

<p>Within forty days of the usurper's actions, the loyalists murdered him and crowned Princess Pourandokht as First Sassanian female Empress. She was then deposed in favor of her sister Azarmidokht, who was then murdered by another General. So Pourandokht was crowned for a second time. And then she was murdered herself.</p>

<h3><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yazdegerd_III"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Yazdegerd III of Persia</a></h3>

<p>Yezdegerd also bears some resemblence with Daenerys:</p>

<ol>

<p>So why didn't they take any raven with them ?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","172402","<h2>In Universe</h2>

<p>I can think of a couple of reasons why:</p>

<ul>
<li>Time: They were rushed, they needed to get a wight quickly to gain support of the Crown so they could prepare.</li>
<li>Resources: They were clearly low on resources as they had few men and weapons. They didn't appear to have much even for the men that survived.</li>
<li>Snatch and Grab: They were doing a snatch and grab mission a raven is not needed for such a scenario.</li>
<li>Stealth: They were going for stealth, kill a scouting party and capture one wight. You do not need a raven for such a mission. Also a raven could be noisy and give them away.</li>
<li>Didn't think they'd need it: In the above types of missions you wouldn't need a raven. They had no idea they'd face the full army so they didn't prepare for such an occasion.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another reason that they could have known is that they had no idea a raven would even work. Bran sent a group of ravens North to scout out the army of the dead. When the Night King looked at them they scattered. It's unclear if this was because of the Night King, the ravens getting scared or Bran getting scared.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ALLISER THRONE: I had a choice, Lord Commander. <strong>Betray you or betray the Night’s Watch.</strong> You brought an army of wildlings into our lands. An army of muderers and raiders. If I had to do it all over knowing where I’d end up, I pray I’d make the right choice again.

Martin: Why he wrote The Red Wedding -- EXCLUSIVE</a> GRRM is quoted as saying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve said in many interviews that I like my fiction to be
  unpredictable. I like there to be considerable suspense. I killed Ned
  in the first book and it shocked a lot of people. I killed Ned because
  everybody thinks he’s the hero and that, sure, he’s going to get into
  trouble, but then he’ll somehow get out of it. The next predictable
  thing is to think his eldest son is going to rise up and avenge his
  father. And everybody is going to expect that. So immediately [killing
  Robb] became the next thing I had to do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, in ASOIAF the death of key characters (on all 'sides') makes the work unpredictable to a reader lulled into a certain sense of security about the life and death of key characters in many other works (especially those that center on a single protagonist- e.g. Harry Potter). [I'm refraining from giving concrete examples to avoid spoilers.]</p>

<p>Is it possible that <em>Valar Morghulis</em> (all men must die) is a sort of meta-theme of ASOIAF and the nature of the world that GRRM has created as an author? </p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","36538","<p>(Spoilering things that haven't happened on TV yet, even though this is about the books.)</p>

<p>I think <em>valar morghulis</em> is actually a bit <em>too</em> morbid to be considered an overarching theme of Martin's world. It's more accurate to say that Martin's world is based on the idea that ""<em>any</em> man <em>could</em> die"".</p>

<p>I may regret saying this the minute the next book comes out, but I don't think that <em>every</em> character in the story is going to end up dying before the story ends. Some will need to survive to bring the story to its climax and resolution.</p>

<p>What Martin is trying to do, instead, is to intentionally subvert many of the standard tropes of medieval fantasy. Martin is removing the built-in invulnerability that often comes with certain character types, and clearly indicating that he is willing and able to kill off characters when it advanced his story. But he's also willing to let characters <em>survive</em> when it fits his story; for example: Tyrion, Beric Dondarrion, Sandor Clegane, and</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Catelyn Stark</p>
</blockquote>

<p>among others. These are people that were in situations where we expected them to and/or actually watched them die, yet Martin kept them alive/resurrected them because it made the story better.</p>

<p>People often express this as Martin striving for realism, or cynicism. I think both of those are true but missing the point. Martin's world is apathetic and brutal. The ""world"", such as it were, didn't care that Ned Stark was a really good guy. He made stupid decisions and he died. Same goes for Robb -- the fact that he betrayed the Freys ""for love"" did not make a difference in the end. But the same goes for the cynical or despicable characters that also met a bad end, e.g.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Joffrey and Tywin</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those characters didn't die because they were good or evil, they died because of a combination of specific actions they took, actions beyond their own control, and a bit of bad luck. That's how the natural world actually works, and Martin seems to be trying to remind us over and over that no one is immune to the whims of nature. But that doesn't mean nature ""has it out"" for anyone, it just has no particular preference for which characters end up suffering/dying and which don't.</p>

<h2>Longclaw</h2>
<p>Though not exactly the same when you look at the replicas the sword keeps the main spirit alive so I'd say it is faithful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pommel was a hunk of pale stone weighted with lead to balance the long blade. It had been carved into the likeness of a snarling wolf's head, with chips of garnet set into the eyes. The grip was virgin leather, soft and black, as yet unstained by sweat or blood. The blade itself was a good half foot longer than those Jon was used to, tapered to thrust as well as slash, with three fullers deeply incised in the metal. Where Ice was a true two-handed greatsword, this was a hand-and-a-halfer, sometimes named a &quot;bastard sword.&quot; Yet the wolf sword actually seemed lighter than the blades he had wielded before. When Jon turned it sideways, he could see the ripples in the dark steel where the metal had been folded back on itself again and again. &quot;This is Valyrian steel, my lord,&quot; he said wonderingly. His father had let him handle Ice often enough; he knew the look, the feel.</p>

<h1>Swords that aren't faithful</h1>
<p>For completeness sake I am also going to cover some of the main swords in the series. These are ones that are named and shown or belong to a main character (also mostly ones that Valyrian Steel have also created replicas for).</p>
<p>As a general comment I just want to repeat that Valyrian Steel is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your source of officially licensed replica weapons and armor from HBO® 's hit TV series Game of Thrones® , and George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire book series.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As such their depictions of the weapons should be pretty accurate, especially since apparently they work with GRRM to design them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We manufacture weapon and armor replicas from George R.R. Martin's bestselling book series. Each item is an individually serialized limited edition and comes with a certificate of authenticity personally autographed by Mr. Martin himself. <strong>Each item is designed while working closely with Mr. Martin to make sure they fit his vision.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also that their A Song of Ice and Fire swords come with the following notices, the following is for needle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the exclusive officially licensed Needle, Sword of Arya Stark, from &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire.&quot; All swords come with a <strong>certificate of authenticity personally autographed by George R.R. Martin.</strong> Each sword is a limited edition of 2500 pieces and the back of the blade has been laser etched in very fine print with the edition number and a copyright notice so you know it is authentic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As such it appears that GRRM agrees that these are the versions of the swords that are true to the books.</p>
<p>Each of the following blades are different in the show compared to the books:</p>
<h3>Ice</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Eddard Stark dismounted and his ward Theon Greyjoy brought forth the sword. &quot;Ice,&quot; that sword was called. It was as wide across as a man's hand, and taller even than Robb. The blade was Valyrian steel, spell-forged and dark as smoke. Nothing held an edge like Valyrian steel.</p>
<p><sub>A Game of Thrones, Bran I</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CfIwBm.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/CfIwBm.jpg"" alt=""Ned with Ice"" /></a> <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/afxVPm.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/afxVPm.jpg"" alt=""Ice - book version"" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see from the above pictures the hilt is completely different. The book version has a white grip with gold and silver decoration in the middle, it also appears to be made of suede. The crossguard is quite short to the sword width of has the words &quot;Winter is Coming&quot; written across it, lastly, it has a folded, patterned blade characteristic of Valyrian Steel. In the show however, the hilt has a large plain crossguard and a large brown grip. This grip also appears to be made of leather.</p>
<h3>Widows Wail</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>His father glanced up. &quot;I did. Come have a look at this.&quot; A bundle of oilcloth lay on the table between them, and Lord Tywin had a longsword in his hand. &quot;A wedding gift for Joffrey,&quot; he told Tyrion. The light streaming through the diamond-shaped panes of glass made the blade shimmer black and red as Lord Tywin turned it to inspect the edge, while the pommel and crossguard flamed gold. &quot;With this fool's jabber of Stannis and his magic sword, it seemed to me that we had best give Joffrey something extraordinary as well. A king should bear a kingly weapon.&quot;</p>
<p><sub>A Storm of Swords, Tyrion IV</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/asrOUm.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/asrOUm.jpg"" alt=""Joffery with Widows Wail"" /></a></p>
<p>There isn't a replica for the book version of Widows Wail yet but we can expect it to be different as the blade is meant to be red and the show blade is not.</p>
<h3>Oathkeeper</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A crimson sword might flash prettily in the sun, but if truth be told I like these colors better,&quot; said Tyrion. &quot;They have an ominous beauty . . . and they make this blade unique. There is no other sword like it in all the world, I should think.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is one.&quot; The armorer bent over the table and unfolded the bundle of oilcloth, to reveal a second longsword.</p>
<p>Tyrion put down Joffrey's sword and took up the other. If not twins, the two were at least close cousins. This one was thicker and heavier, a half-inch wider and three inches longer, but they shared the same fine clean lines and the same distinctive color, the ripples of blood and night. Three fullers, deeply incised, ran down the second blade from hilt to point; the king's sword had only two. Joff's hilt was a good deal more ornate, the arms of its crossguard done as lions' paws with ruby claws unsheathed, but both swords had grips of finely tooled red leather and gold lions' heads for pommels.</p>
<p><sub>A Storm of Swords, Tyrion IV</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3HpWjm.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/3HpWjm.jpg"" alt=""Brienne with Oathkeeper"" /></a> <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pdL0Xm.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pdL0Xm.jpg"" alt=""Oathkeeper - book version"" /></a></p>
<p>Again like Widows Wail it isn't faithful as it doesn't have the characteristic red blade from the books. Looking at the hilts, they too are completely different. In the show it is one piece of a golden lion and quite decorative. Whereas, in the books it has a simple gold crossguard with a lion on each end, a red grip and gold detailed pommel.</p>
<h3>Valrian Steel Dagger</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The blade Joff chose was nice and plain. No goldwork, no jewels in the hilt, no silver inlay on the blade. King Robert never wore it, had likely forgotten he owned it. Yet the Valyrian steel was deadly sharp . . . sharp enough to slice through skin, flesh, and muscle in one quick stroke. I am no stranger to Valyrian steel. But he had been, hadn't he? Else he would never have been so foolish as to pick Littlefinger's knife.</p>

<p>There is no replica of the book version yet, however, I have found this quote from GRRM claiming that they are different:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A handsome blade, I think. Though rather completely different from the dagger in the books, which was far plainer (though made of Valryian steel, with a dragonbone grip).</p>

</blockquote>
<h3>Dawn - The Sword of Morning's Sword</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, had a sad smile on his lips. The hilt of the greatsword Dawn poked up over his right shoulder.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>&quot;And now it begins,&quot; said Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. He unsheathed Dawn and held it with both hands. The blade was pale as milkglass, alive with light.</p>
<p><sub>A Game of Thrones, Eddard X</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although there isn't a replica of the book version, in the show Ser Arthur Dayne dual wields two swords so it's possible they changed the sword into two. However, When Ned rides upto the Kingsguard Arthur has a sword out in front of him. This looks to be Dawn.</p>

<p>If it is then the shows version doesn't look to be faithful to the books as it doesn't look to be a greatsword and does not have a pale milkglass blade.</p>
<h3>Jaime Lannister's Sword</h3>

<h1>Swords where it's unclear</h1>
<p>The following swords are unclear as to whether or not they are faithful.</p>
<h3>Khal Drogo's Arakh</h3>
<p>There isn't much description on Drogo's weapons, the only bit I could find was his &quot;brides gifts&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Haggo gave her a great leather whip with a silver handle, Cohollo a <strong>magnificent arakh chased in gold</strong>, and Qotho a double-curved dragonbone bow taller than she was.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Theon was castrated after being tortured by Ramsay Snow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Was this ever explicitly mentioned in the books? I only recall Theon losing a few fingers and teeth in addition to having parts of his skin flayed.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><adaptation-comparison>","36826","<p>It's implied, but not confirmed that he lost that part.

"36841","When did the traitor turn?","<p>Major spoiler for season 3 of GOT:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Lord Bolton betrays the Starks by returning Jamie Lannister to Kings Landing and then assisting in the massacre of the Starks by the Frays. In return, he is made Warden of the North (at least in the hypothetical Lannister victory version of the post war Westeros). Bolton had earlier served with distinction under Robb Stark, including leading the attack in which Jamie Lannister was captured in the first place. At what point did Bolton turn? How long had he been plotting with the Lannisters?</p>
</blockquote>
","<game-of-thrones>","36857","<p>""When"" is a good question. I think the answer is that Roose plots all the time. When Robb called the banners, I think Roose went through his options and thought about how to gain the most from the situation. </p>

<p>Spoilers ADWD below</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>We get some insight into Roose's mind through lady Dustin, who claims that Roose is somewhat of a psychopath, who has no feelings and likes to manipulate people for his own amusement. Even so, Roose likes to stay ""below the radar"", let other people take the blame while he reaps the benefits. Walder Frey certainly took most of the blame for the Red Wedding, for example, though my hunch is that Roose Bolton was the bigger culprit (he did personally kill Robb).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is as Jaime said in ASOS (paraphrasing)-- that every lord has unruly bannermen who envy them their power. Tywin had the Tarbecks, the Tyrells have the Florents, Hoster Tully has Walder Frey, Ned Stark had Roose Bolton. Strength is the only thing that keeps such men in check. And when they smell weakness, they turn.</p>

<p>Spoilers ADWD below</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>Roose Bolton himself told Theon in ADWD that he had him to thank for winning the North. That house Stark was done when Theon sacked Winterfell. That was almost certainly not when he started plotting betrayal, but it would have encouraged him to set his plans in motion. Also, we do not know whether Roose and Ramsay planned to attack Winterfell, or if Ramsay did it on his own initiative and Roose felt compelled to see it through. We do know that Roose considers Ramsay his only option for house Bolton's survival (unless he lied to Theon about that in ADWD).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Roose found himself in possession of many important hostages, and the leader of big armies. Most notably, of course, he found Jaime which opened a dialogue with Tywin. He also got his hands on the Frey boys in Winterfell, which he no doubt used as leverage against Walder Frey. He sent Robett Glover and Ser Helman Tallart to raid <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Duskendale"">Duskendale</a>, where they were ambushed and defeated by Randyll Tarly and Gregor Clegane. No doubt this was done intentionally in order to kill off Stark loyalists. He did a few such manoeuvres.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that Roose would never have believed he could take the north in his own name, he is too much of a realist for that: The North would never support Ramsay, or a Bolton, only a Stark. Which is why he could not be seen to be directly involved in the Red Wedding, and why fake Arya was so important to his plans.</p>

<p>So, as for when Roose started planning it, I think the answer is: He always planned it. It was just a question of when he could start doing something about it, when he was given opportunities and when Robb showed weakness. </p>

"36842","Why did the amputation occur?","<p>Spoiler for season 3 of GOT:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> I realise this is different from the books (which I haven't read), but why is Jamie Lannister's hand cut off? Surely Lord Bolton's henchman who does it knows that Bolton is actually plotting with the Lannisters, so he knows he is mutilating an important member of the King's family; the King that is most likely to win the war once Bolton's betrayal occurs. Why does he do it and why is he not punished by Bolton for doing so once he hands Jamie over to him? Bolton seems most concerned that Tywin Lannister know he did not do the deed, but doesn't seem to be too fussed about the fact that it was still done by a soldier under his command, a soldier he barely reprimands let alone punishes?</p>
</blockquote>
","<game-of-thrones>","36846","<p>I'm answering this without spoiler tags, if that's alright.  If you haven't seen Season 3 so far, <em>you've been warned</em>.</p>

<p>First, I wouldn't assume that Locke(I think that's who does the deed) would know about where Bolton's loyalties lie.  The more people who know, the more someone might let it slip and out Bolton to someone more loyal to Robb.  I certainly wouldn't trust that information unless absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Second, I think that if Tywin presses the issue Bolton can pass the blame on Locke and offer him up to Tywin.  In the show, it's not been shown how Tywin will react yet.  We'll see what Season 4 brings.  </p>

<p>In the books however, it's a completely different matter.  The issue is addressed more directly, and it interesting enough to post.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> A sellsword company led by Vargo Hoat under the pay of Roose Bolton turned from the Lannister's side to Robb's.  After the Lannister's victory at the Battle of the Blackwater, Vargo was worried about Roose Bolton shifting allegiances back to the Lannisters.  They captured Jaime and Brienne and in order to prevent Bolton turning sides again, he amputates Jaime's hand so the Lannisters place blame on Bolton(and make Tywin angry, as you suspected would happen).<br>
 In the books, Bolton releases Jaime if he absolves Bolton of any blame for the loss of his hand.  Jaime agrees and he departs for King's Landing similarly as in the show.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Books have a more satisfying reasoning behind it all, personally.  The TV series doesn't go into much detail, but you expect to have some things left hanging with so much going on.  They handled it fairly well as far as I'm concerned.</p>

"36871","How does raven post work?","<p>How does raven post work? A raven knows to fly to one particular castle. But what happens after that? Kept at its home castle, a raven is useless.</p>

<p>The only solution I can think of is that ravens are redistributed by ground, carted in cages (or shipped by sea). That'd work, although slowly—Westeros takes weeks to traverse. This'd explain why raven post is so costly.</p>

<p>Is this ever discussed in the books? Of all the characters travelling between castles, I don't recall any moving ravens, or seeing others doing it.</p>

<hr>

<p>The system above is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attack. Suppose a man arrived at Winterfell with a trout on his coat and a cage of ravens ""from Riverrun"". It's entirely possible that the man and the ravens came from <em>Casterly Rock</em>, and that letters sent with them find their way to Tywin Lannister.</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><game-of-thrones>","36872","<p>According to a <a href=""http://www.ign.com/boards/threads/sample-chapter-from-winds-of-winter.207815997/"">sample chapter</a> from the Winds of Winter, most ravens can only fly to one place, although there are rare exceptions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""A maester's raven flies to one place, and one place only. Is that correct?""</p>
  
  <p>The maester mopped sweat from his brow with his sleeve. ""N-not entirely, Your Grace. Most, yes. Some few can be taught to fly between two castles. Such birds are greatly prized. And once in a very great while, we find a raven who can learn the names of three or four or five castles, and fly to each upon command. Birds as clever as that come along only once in a hundred years.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other than those rare birds, presumably once a raven is back at its home castle it would then have to be transported to a new location in a cage in order for it to be of any practical use. The clearest example of this is, as Zoe mentioned, when the Night's Watch took a cart of ravens with them on the Great Ranging. There may be other examples as well.</p>

<hr />

<p>Regarding a ""man-in-the-middle"" attack. To prevent such an attack you would either have to cipher your messages using a code only the intended recipient knows how to decode, or you would have to know/trust the person(s) bringing you the ravens. </p>

<p>Neither contingency is discussed in the books, although in <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Game_of_Thrones-Chapter_6"">chapter 6 of GOT</a> Catelyn  mentions that a letter sent by Lysa was written using a secret language only the two of them shared. And it is not unreasonable that the people bringing/receiving ravens would expect to know each other.</p>

<p>In ""our"" universe (IE outside of the books), <a href=""http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1149.txt"">RFC 1149</a> briefly discusses security considerations for secure transmission of data via avian carriers:</p>

<p>Pycelle had (obviously) gone on to serve both King Joffrey and King Tommen before his death in 300 AC.</p>
<p>The usually very accurate and well sourced wiki by Elio M. Garcia and Linda Antonsson (who started <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/About/"" rel=""noreferrer"">westeros.org</a>) states that although Maester Cressen left his seat at Storm's End and joined Stannis a Dragonstone, it was very uncommon for Maesters to do because of their role at one House.</p>

<p>Cressen likely accepted to follow Stannis because Stannis was like a son to him. After the death of their Father Steffon Baratheon, it was left to Maester Cressen to raise the three boys, of which Cressen love Stannis the most.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maester Cressen blinked. Stannis, my lord, my sad sullen boy, son I never had, you must not do this, don't you know how I have cared for you, lived for you, loved you despite all? <strong>Yes, loved you, better than Robert even, or Renly</strong>, for you were the one unloved, the one who needed me most.<br />

<p>Maester Colemon also followed his Lord, Jon Arryn, to King's Landing abandoning (albeit temporarily) the seat he was assigned. He was sent back after he was succesfully purging Jon Arryn of his poison because the &quot;queen needed him dead&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I have heard that you sent Maester Colemon away.&quot;
The Grand Maester's nod was as slow and deliberate as a glacier. &quot;I did, and I fear the Lady Lysa will never forgive me that. Maybe I was wrong, but at the time I thought it best. Maester Colemon is like a son to me, and I yield to none in my esteem for his abilities, but he is young, and the young ofttimes do not comprehend the frailty of an older body.

"37587","Game of Thrones' Season 3 - Chapters Adapted from the Book?","<p>Now that <em>Game of Thrones</em> season 3 is over, I'm left wondering how much of <em>A Storm of Swords</em> they were able to adapt. In some <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_(season_3)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sources (Wikipedia)</a> it's stated that ""roughly the first half"" of the book made it into the third season. It'd be interesting to know an exact figure from someone who has both read the book and watched the TV series.</p>

<p>What was the highest-numbered chapter in the third book that they were able to squeeze into the TV series? Up to what chapter was covered for each of the POV characters? (example: Daenerys III, Jon III) No spoilers, please! I'm reading the book <em>before</em> watching the third season.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","37591","<p>It's not a clean break.</p>

<p>Season 3 includes the <em>entirety</em> of some characters/regions plot arcs, while barely touching others. We've seen roughly half of the content, but the order of events has been so jumbled, as to make it impossible to really set a chapter as the point to read up to.</p>

<p>For example, the character of Oberyn Martell has not yet been introduced in the TV series. He <em>has</em> been cast for Season 4 (he hasn't been cut), but his entire narrative arc has been shifted to season 4. Meanwhile, Catelyn and Robb's storyline has entirely resolved itself. There's little-to-nothing left to include in season 4 unless the writers dip into the content of the subsequent novels to keep them in for occasional scenes.</p>

"37666","Why do people of the realm hate Jaime Lannister?","<p>As I understand it, the people of the realm hate Jaime Lannister because he is a Kingslayer. But he slew the mad King Aerys, who everyone agrees was insane and cruel. This helped Robert to become King, and the realm loves Robert. So, in a way, Jaime did a good deed by slaying the Mad King. Other than that he hasn't broken any oath (that the public knows of). So why do people in general mock and hate him?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","37672","<p>I would not say that Jaime is ""hated"". More like, people who value honour, such as Ned Stark, Barristan Selmy or Brynden ""the Blackfish"" Tully, see him as an oathbreaker, and someone not to be trusted. The ""smallfolk"", i.e. the person on the street, may call him Kingslayer and mock him, painting him as a ""bad guy"", whereas someone like Ser Barristan is considered a good guy. There are many who do not dislike Jaime at all, or who do not simply care what he did to Aerys. Such as Robert himself, who I believe said </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Damn, Ned, someone had to kill Aerys!""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is important to remember, though, that Jaime is also the son of one of the most influential houses in Westeros, and he is (was) skilled at arms and arrogant and rich, which is reason enough for him to attract some scorn, and then ""Kingslayer"" becomes a word to use against him.</p>

<p>It is also important to remember that Jaime is, in fact, worthy of a certain amount of hatred. He did push Bran from the window, trying to kill him, and he did kill Jory Cassel and the other Stark men in King's Landing, just to spite Ned. He did have a sexual relationship with his sister and commit treason against his king (again!), not once, but many times, and he is complicit in the conspiracy to usurp the throne from the rightful king (Robert/Stannis).</p>

<p>While he may have saved the people of King's Landing from the baptism of fire that Aerys planned for them, it does not excuse him from Kingslaying if he does not tell anyone, and just because you get pardoned by a grateful new king does not mean you earned the right to sulk and act like a spoiled brat for decades because you didn't feel like telling anyone about your heroism. </p>

<p>Jaime's story arc is one of redemption, no doubt, and I am guessing that he will eventually do something that will make us readers truly forgive him. And it does seem that it has something to do with Brienne and (Spoiler TV-series season 3+, ASOS)</p>

"37862","Comprehensive Rules for Game of Thrones Lines of Succession","<p>I'm three quarters through the third book, ""Storm of Swords"" right now (so please, no spoilers from too late in the book or any subsequent books).  I just read a part where Tyrion is discussing with Prince Oberyn and they mention the difference between Dornish law and Westerosi law in Line of Succession (ie women can rule under Dornish law).</p>

<p>I'm a little confused trying to puzzle out what the exact LOS rules are.</p>

<p>At first I though it was: at the moment a king/lord dies, to find who holds the title next, you do a depth-first search down the family tree starting with the oldest sibling (ignoring anyone who isn't true-born or has given up their claim ie as Night's Watch or Kingsguard etc.).  Then, for Dornish law you take the first living person and for Westerosi law the first living male person found in this way (so succession can pass through a woman in both cases, but only Dornish law actually allows them to claim the title). If there are no valid living heirs, then you work backwards along the paternal line until you find an ancestor who has living heirs and start from them.</p>

<p>But there were various references to if Sansa's brothers were all dead, then her child would claim Winterfell.  It seems to me that that's only true if somebody else doesn't get it first.  In other words, if Sansa's brothers are killed before she has a child (even if she's already married), doesn't that mean Winterfell would pass to the nearest cousin along her father's line (whomever that may be)?  And then because that cousin has already held Winterfell, when they die the next in the line of succession starts from them so Sansa's children's family would not have claim to Winterfell again unless that cousin has no valid heirs.</p>

<p>What am I missing here? Is there some exception?  Are there no valid cousins?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","37871","<p>Except for the Dornish, Westerosi succession goes like this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Succession goes to the King's eldest male child's <em>line</em>, meaning that even if the eldest male child is dead the succession passed through to his heirs, and only after that line is explored do we go to the next step.</p></li>
<li><p>When a King has no male children or their lines are extinguished, succession goes to the eldest female child's line.</p></li>
<li><p>When a King has no children or their lines are extinguished, we go through the same steps 1 &amp; 2 but among the King's siblings (i.e. His father's children).</p></li>
<li><p>If we still have no heirs we <em>go up a level</em>. In other words we search through the King's grandfather's children. If that fails we continue going up until an heir is found (or we run into a stack-overflow exception ;) )</p></li>
</ol>

<p>However, one must remember that these are ideal world rules. In practice, when the succession gets convoluted by the lack of direct heirs opportunists will rise up claiming succession (usually backed up by a large army).</p>

<p>Since I'm sure a lot of us here are coders (the OP definitely is) here's my attempt at pseudo code implementation. I'm sure it could be done much better, so feel free to fix.</p>

"37908","How is the murder attempt consistent with Varys' plan?","<p><strong>This question is about a book 1/season 1 event, regarding enlightening from book 5.
The event of the book 1 will not be in spoiler tags as it happens fairly early, but the reveals from book 5 will.</strong></p>

<p>In book 1, following an order from King Robert, Varys sends a poisoner to sell some poisoned wine to Daenerys. </p>

<p>Jorah Mormont, who by then has fallen in love with Daenerys (come on, this is so obvious that it's not a spoiler..), saves her by spotting the seller's suspicious behavior.</p>

<p>In book 5, it is revealed that </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Varys is working in secret with Illyrio Mopatis for years in favor of the Targaryens.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I put it in spoiler tag but it can be deduced as early as book 1, during the ""Arya chasing the cat into the castle's underground"" chapter.</p>

<p>What is really confirmed in book 5 is that </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Mormont was a spy for the council. He betrayed it when he felt in love with Daenerys.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Since Varys could not have possibly known that Jorah Mormont would save the day, why did he actually send the poisoner instead of just saying to King Robert ""I sent him, but he failed"" ?</strong></p>

<p>Am I missing something ? Let me kknow if the question is unclear.</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><game-of-thrones>","37918","<p>The letter that Jorah received from Varys contained a warning about assassination attempts. Varys did not send the poisoner, the poisoner acted on his own accord. Littlefinger tells Ned that he ""saved"" Dany by making the council agree to bestow a lordship on whoever killed Dany, rather than hire a professional (such as a faceless man).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Littlefinger to Ned:] ""After you stormed out, it was left to me to convince them not to hire
  the Faceless Men,"" he continued blithely. ""Instead Varys will quietly
  let it be known that we'll make a lord of whoever does in the
  Targaryen girl.""</p>
  
  <p>Ned was disgusted. ""So now we grant titles to assassins.""</p>
  
  <p>Littlefinger shrugged. ""Titles are cheap. The Faceless Men are
  expensive. If truth be told, I did the Targaryen girl more good than
  you with all your talk of honor. Let some sellsword drunk on visions
  of lordship try to kill her. Likely he'll make a botch of it, and
  afterward the Dothraki will be on their guard. If we'd sent a Faceless
  Man after her, she'd be as good as buried.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>CL4PTR4P makes a good point in the comments that Robert does withdraw the assassination order on his death bed, and that <em>might</em> be where the warning to Jorah comes from. Varys was (probably) the one to send the messages about the assassination, but I do not believe he had much choice in the matter: He must be seen to try, or it would cost his life.</p>

<p>I agree though that Varys and Illyrio's behaviour towards Dany and Viserys have been somewhat strange. Especially... (Major spoiler ADWD):</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>..considering the way that they have nurtured, pampered and protected Aegon for years. In contrast, they have let Viserys die, sold Daenerys to the dothraki and more or less abandoned her to live or die.<p>
Because it is clear that they intend for Aegon to rule, considering Varys' speech to Kevan Lannister, it is very strange that they allowed Dany and Viserys to believe that they were the royal heirs. It would be very awkward if they presented Aegon to Viserys... ""So... ehm... here's the <em>real</em> king of Westeros. Would you kindly step aside?""<p>
I am starting to wonder about Bloodraven's involvement, especially considering that he more or less had the same job as Varys in his days. Its been speculated that Varys is a hidden Targaryen, and he does have a shaved head, much like Egg (Aegon V) in the <em>Dunk &amp; Egg</em> novels.</p>

"174687","Do we know when Daenerys Targaryen was born?","<p>I doubt we have an actual birth date but I'm sure at least the year can be found out. It appears as though <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Robert%27s_Rebellion"" rel=""noreferrer"">Robert's Rebellion</a> took place from 282 AC to 283 AC so that means she was born sometime from 282 AC to 284 AC.</p>

<p>Does anyone know when Daenerys Targaryen was born?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","174689","<h1>A Song of Ice and Fire</h1>
<h3>284 AC</h3>
<p>We know that Dany was born to King Aerys Targaryen II and Queen Rhaella Targaryen, we also know that Rhaella was sent to Dragonstone after the Battle of the Trident and before the Sack of King's Landing, so sometime in 283 AC.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Rhaegar met Robert on the Trident, and you know what happened there. When the word reached court, <strong>Aerys packed the queen off to Dragonstone with Prince Viserys.</strong> Princess Elia would have gone as well, but he forbade it. Somehow he had gotten it in his head that Prince Lewyn must have betrayed Rhaegar on the Trident, but he thought he could keep Dorne loyal so long as he kept Elia and Aegon by his side.<br />

</blockquote>
<p>And if it isn't obvious from the situation that Rhaella must have already been pregnant The World of Ice and Fire spells it out for us.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Birds flew and couriers raced to bear word of the victory at the Ruby Ford. When the news reached the Red Keep, it was said that Aerys cursed the Dornish, certain that Lewyn had betrayed Rhaegar. <strong>He sent his pregnant queen, Rhaella, and his younger son and new heir, Viserys, away to Dragonstone</strong>, but Princess Elia was forced to remain in King's Landing with Rhaegar's children as a hostage against Dorne.<br />
<sub>The World of Ice and Fire, The Fall of the Dragons: The End</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dany herself mentions she was born &quot;nine moons&quot; after the flight to Dragonstone placing her birth at the end of 283 AC or in 284 AC, however, it is more likely to be 284 AC.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>She had been born on Dragonstone nine moons after their flight</strong>, while a raging summer storm threatened to rip the island fastness apart. They said that storm was terrible. The Targaryen fleet was smashed while it lay at anchor, and huge stone blocks were ripped from the parapets and sent hurtling into the wild waters of the narrow sea. Her mother had died birthing her, and for that her brother Viserys had never forgiven her.<br />
<sub>A Game of Thrones, Daenerys I</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eddard Stark mentions on a couple of occassions about 14 years having passed from King Robert Baratheon being crowned but he explicitly states Dany's age twice and this happens in 298 AC as <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Timeline_of_major_events#A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire"" rel=""noreferrer"">we know the series starts in this year</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Whereas <strong>Daenerys is a fourteen-year-old girl.</strong>&quot; Ned knew he was pushing this well past the point of wisdom, yet he could not keep silent. &quot;Robert, I ask you, what did we rise against Aerys Targaryen for, if not to put an end to the murder of children?&quot;<br />

<p>This still leaves both years as being possible for Dany to have been born in. However, we learn that Dany finds out she is pregnant on her 14th name day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They were on the far side of the Dothraki sea when Jhiqui brushed the soft swell of Dany's stomach with her fingers and said, <strong>&quot;Khaleesi, you are with child.&quot;</strong><br />
&quot;I know,&quot; Dany told her.<br />
<strong>It was her fourteenth name day.</strong><br />

<p>Her pregnancy is discussed in Kings Landing sometime after the Hand's Tourney.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<strong>The whore is pregnant!</strong>&quot; The king's fist slammed down on the council table loud as a thunderclap. &quot;I warned you this would happen, Ned. Back in the barrowlands, I warned you, but you did not care to hear it. Well, you'll hear it now. I want them dead, mother and child both, and that fool Viserys as well. Is that plain enough for you?

<p>The following article mentions that the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/History_of_tourneys_in_Westeros#The_Hand.27s_tourney"" rel=""noreferrer"">Hand's Tourney takes place in 298 AC</a> though I don't know if this is referenced elsewhere. As we know the series starts in 298 AC this would mean Dany more than likely turns 14 in 298 AC placing her birth in 284 AC.</p>
<p>However, for something more concrete Dany mentions she is still 14 when she is following the comet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We follow the comet,&quot; Dany told her khalasar. Once it was said, no word was raised against it. They had been Drogo's people, but they were hers now. The Unburnt, they called her, and Mother of Dragons. Her word was their law.<br />
...<br />
They are not strong, she told herself, so I must be their strength. I must show no fear, no weakness, no doubt. However frightened my heart, when they look upon my face they must see only Drogo's queen. She felt older than her fourteen years. If ever she had truly been a girl, that time was done.<br />
<sub>A Clash of Kings, Daenerys I</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following wiki page asserts that the comet appears in the sky in 299 AC.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first time the Red Comet is mentioned to have been seen, occurs after Rickon Stark has turned 4. Thus all POVs where the Red Comet appears can be said to take place in 299 AC with certainty.<br />

</blockquote>
<p>Note that Rickon is born in the year 295 AC and though I won't go adding quotes here, here's the summary of the calculation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rickon was 3 years old when the direwolves are found and during the welcoming feast at Winterfell. Both events occur in 298 AC, giving the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>2 turning 3 in 298 AC, 3 turning 4 in 299 AC, 4 turning 5 in 300 AC, placing his birth in 295 AC</p>
</li>
<li><p>3 turning 4 in 298 AC, 4 turning 5 in 299 AC, 5 turning 6 in 300 AC, placing his birth in 294 AC</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Rickon was “near four” when Robb left for war, and he was 4 when the news of Ned's death reached Winterfell. Rickon was still four when Theon Greyjoy attacked Winterfell. After the Sack of Winterfell Rickon is still at 4. In 300 AC, Rickon is still 4 years old. This shows that the only correct option for Rickon is 3 turning 4 in 299 AC, placing his birth in 295 AC.<br />

<p>Her birth is stated on <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Daenerys_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">her wikia page</a> and is cited as shortly after <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Robert%27s_Rebellion"" rel=""noreferrer"">Robert's Rebellion</a>. Robert's rebellion took place around 280 AL to 282 AL according to the page and so she must have been born in 282 AL or 283 AL. However it is  stated that the rebelleion ended on Dragonstone in 282 AL and as Dany had been born there and fled before the end she must have been born in 282 AL. This also places her age as 16 turning 17 in 298 AL, the start of the show.</p>
<p>The following westeros.org page seems to contradict this saying the following, though I don't know where it is sourced from.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Daenerys has been aged for the show. In the novels, she is 13 when she is first introduced. In Game of Thrones, she is 15 years old. Contacts to give her violet eyes were tried in the pilot, but proved more trouble than they were worth.<br />

<p>It appears as though they were keeping the birth year the same as the books when the looked into their calculations. However, the following article backs up the wikia stating that Dany is 17 at the start of the show which reinforces her birth in 282 AL, where it is sourced from I don't know.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Age in the books:</strong> In A Game of Thrones (the first book in George RR Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire series), Daenerys is around 13 years old.<br />
<strong>Age in the TV show:</strong> In HBO’s adaptation, it is stated in season one that 17 years have passed since Robert Baratheon’s rebellion – around the time Daenerys was born. It is therefore reasonable to suggest that Daenerys starts the show as a 17 year old. By season six, around five years have passed since the first episode, so we can safely assume that Daenerys is in her early twenties, let’s say, 22 years old. It’s easy to understand why they increased Dany’s age for the show since she had to shoot some pretty uncomfortable and risqué scenes with Khal Drogo from the start of the series.<br />

<p>GRRM has even gone on record talking about why the show changed the ages and mentions the age increase for the show.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>There was a fair amount of explicit sex in the series and some fans of the books were taken aback.</strong><br />
One of the reasons I wanted to do this with HBO is that I wanted to keep the sex. We had some real problems because Dany is only 13 in the books, and that’s based on medieval history. They didn’t have this concept of adolescence or the teenage years. You were a child or you were an adult. And the onset of sexual maturity meant you were an adult. So I reflected that in the books. But then when you go to film it you run into people going crazy about child pornography and there’s actual laws about how you can’t depict a 13 year old having sex even if you have an 18 year old acting the part — it’s illegal in the United Kingdom. So we ended up with a 22 year old portraying an 18 year old, instead of an 18 year old portraying a 13 year old. If we decided to lose the sex we could have kept the original ages. And once you change the age of one character you have to change the ages of all the characters, and change the date of the war [that dethroned the Mad King]. The fact we made all these changes indicates how important we thought sex was.<br />

<p>This makes sense as with age changes, other dates need to be changed too so the story still lines up correctly. As such it makes sense that they've changed the year system in the show.</p>

"39025","What is Harrenhal?","<p>In the 2nd season of Game of Thrones, we see Tyrion Lannister, in a plot to find out the traitor among counsels, offer Baelish the control of Harrenhal. Then later on, we are shown Harrenhal when Arya Stark is brought there among others. But we are not given much information to what it is.</p>

<p>Is it like a prison of the Seven Kingdoms or like a concentration camp? Who controls it? Also, we see through the series that people committing crimes are given a choice. Either lose their hands or serve on the wall. So why aren't prisoners of Harrenhal (if it is a prison) given that choice?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","39026","<p>Harrenhal is not a prison at all. It is said to be the largest castle in the Seven Kingdoms. Before it was offered to Baelish, it was the castle of House Whent.</p>

<p>It is also said to be haunted by the ghosts since its founder, Harren the Black, died in flames with all his family when Aegon the Conqueror invaded Westeros with his dragons. The next Houses that occupied in Harrenhal were cursed by the ghosts and lived tragedies. Because of that, Harrenhal have a bad reputation in the Riverlands.</p>

<p>When Game of Thrones begins, Lady Shella Whent is the last member of the family Whent. Her husband and her sons are all dead. When she sees the Lannister's army that want to take that castle and that she can't defend it, she just decides to flee and suddenly disappears, letting Harrenhal to the Lannisters. Joffrey and Cersei award Harrenhal to Janos Slynt, commander of the gold cloaks, for the part he played in apprehending Ned Stark in King's Landing. Later, it is given to Petyr Baelish.</p>

"175057","How is canon determined for the works set in the world of ASOIAF?","<p>George R. R. Martin brought the world of ASOIAF (henceforth called Planetos) to the public when he published his first book <em>A Game of Thrones</em> in 1996. He would go on to write 4 more books over 15 years with at least 2 more in the works. There exists a comic book adaptation which released four volumes in their adaptation of the first book.</p>

<p>The first of his derived works, released in the <em>Legends</em> anthology, was the novella <em>The Hedge Night</em>, which would form the start of <em>The Dunk and Egg Series</em>. He would go on to write two more Novellas in the series with several more in the works. Three other novellas were released, titled <em>The Princess and the Queen</em>, <em>The Rogue Prince, or, the King's Brother</em> and <em>Sons of the Dragon</em>.</p>

<p>Onto other media, there is the award winning TV series which has adapted By David Benioff and D.B Weiss and has since overtaken the books. As well as five spin-off shows, which were confirmed earlier this year.

  <p>The Lion's Paw / Lion's Tooth business, on the other hand, is intentional. <strong>A small touch of the unreliable narrator.</strong> I was trying to establish that the memories of my viewpoint characters are not infallible. Sansa is simply remembering it wrong. A very minor thing (you are the only one to catch it to date), but it was meant to set the stage for a much more important lapse in memory. You will see, in A STORM OF SWORDS and later volumes, that Sansa remembers the Hound kissing her the night he came to her bedroom... but if you look at the scene, he never does. That will eventually mean something, but just now it's a subtle touch, something most of the readers may not even pick up on.</p>

I have found that if one subtracts the magic from this story all we are left with is the Hobbesian state of nature (life is nasty, brutish and short) <a href=""http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137360/charli-carpenter/game-of-thrones-as-theory?page=show"">as confirmed in Foreign Affairs magazine</a>.</p>

<p>However, the ""magic"" in the show adds another facet to the story's metaphysics predominately by way of the Lord of Light. This begs the question (as well as my begging for help ;) what are the rules, conditions, and context for magic to become manifest/actualized?</p>

<p>Thank you for the help!</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","39106","<p>You can invoke mind-matter duality. Certain mental structures affect matter structures. The classic ""what is the mechanism of interaction if they are two separate things"" doesn't really work, because ultimately, there isn't any ""mechanism"" of interaction between anything. I.e. if you say particles interact a certain way because of so and so ""mechanism"", well what is the mechanism that causes that mechanism to work? What is the mechanism that causes the more elementary particles to interact a certain way? And so forth and so forth -- an infinite regress. The ""mechanism"" for how 'mind' interacts with 'matter' is that is just does, just as particles interact a certain way 'just because'. </p>

<p>Also, not all metaphysics regards it in terms of black-and-white duality, but rather different forms of subtle energy or numerous planes of existence. </p>

<p>Sound has long been believed in esotericism to have spiritual effects, i.e. mantras. </p>

<p>Different frequencies also can have some pretty neat physical effects that make it appear as though matter spontaneously responds to sound in unique ways (look up youtube videos of cymatics, including the sounding of Aum in the Great Pyramid by steven halpern)</p>

<p>Suppose a certain mental thoughtform manifests when combined with the right sound patterns. </p>

<p>There is also the simple fact that things at the quantum level, according to physics, are random and chaotic. We are told that a particle is basically an emergence from a more fundamental field, IIRC. What is the force that causes a sustained pattern/manifestation of even a single atom? Some esoteric schools of thought call this ""fohat"". You can call it anything, but it could be used to say that something about a practitioner of magic allows this universal manifestation/sustaining force to flow through/mesh with the practicioner's mind &amp; sound. </p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><adaptation-comparison>","175787","<h1>No</h1>
<p>George R. R. Martin has written on his Not A Blog about this subject where he states that though the Iron Throne is iconic and he does like the way it is shown in the show it's not what he had in mind. However, he does state that there are good reasons why the show couldn't use the version he had in mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And yet, and yet... <strong>it's still not right.</strong> It's not the Iron Throne I see when I'm working on THE WINDS OF WINTER. It's not the Iron Throne I want my readers to see. <strong>The way the throne is described in the books... HUGE, hulking, black and twisted, with the steep iron stairs in front, the high seat from which the king looks DOWN on everyone in the court... my throne is a hunched beast looming over the throne room, ugly and assymetric...</strong></p>
<p>The HBO throne is none of those things. It's big, yes, but not nearly as big as the one described in the novels. And for good reason. We have a huge throne room set in Belfast, but <strong>not nearly huge enough to hold the Iron Throne as I painted it.</strong> For that we'd need something much bigger, more like <strong>the interior of St. Paul's Cathedral or Westminster Abbey, and no set has that much room.</strong> The Book Version of the Iron Throne would not even fit through the doors of the Paint Hall.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>He also goes on to talk about what his version should look like, but still the version he includes, as a picture from the calendar, isn't exactly how he wants it to be it does come close.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That's the Iron Throne as painted by the amazing Marc Simonetti (and if you haven't gotten his 2013 Ice &amp; Fire calendar, better hurry, the year's half over) for the upcoming concordance, THE WORLD OF ICE &amp; FIRE. It's a rough, not a final version, so what you see in the book will be more polished. <strong>But Marc has come closer here to capturing the Iron Throne as I picture it than any other artist to tackle it.</strong> From now on, THIS will be the reference I give to every other artist tackling a throne room scene. This Iron Throne is massive. Ugly. Assymetric. It's a throne made by blacksmiths hammering together half-melted, broken, twisted swords, wrenched from the hands of dead men or yielded up by defeated foes... a symbol of conquest... <strong>it has the steps I describe, and the height.</strong> From on top, the king dominates the throne room. And there are thousands of swords in it, not just a few.</p>
<p>This Iron Throne is scary. And not at all a comfortable seat, just as Aegon intended.</p>
<p>Look on his works, ye mighty, and despair.</p>

<p>Martin has since said the same thing in a panel interview but offers slightly more insight into how tall it is supposed to be.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I said repeatedly the Iron Throne is huge. It towers over the room like a great beast. And it's ugly. It's asymmetric. It's put together by blacksmiths not by craftsmen and experts in furniture manufacturing. <strong>You have to walk the iron steps, and when a king sits on it he's like 10 feet above everybody else</strong> ...

<p>Eddard's description in the books also doesn't fit the show as the amount of blades doesn't match nor does it's dangerousness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ned could feel cold steel against his fingers as he leaned forward. Between each finger was a blade, <strong>the points of twisted swords fanning out like talons from arms of the throne.</strong> Even after three centuries, some were still sharp enough to cut. The Iron Throne was full of traps for the unwary. The songs said it had taken <strong>a thousand blades to make it, heated white-hot in the furnace breath of Balerion the Black Dread.</strong> The hammering had taken fifty-nine days. The end of it was <strong>this hunched black beast made of razor edges and barbs and ribbons of sharp metal;</strong> a chair that could kill a man, and had, if the stories could be believed.</p>
<p><sup>A Game of Thrones, Eddard XI</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later on Eddard notes about the steps down from the seat atop the Iron Throne.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alyn and Porther climbed the <strong>steep iron steps to help him back down.</strong> As they made their descent, he could feel Loras Tyrell's sullen stare, but the boy had stalked away before Ned reached the floor of the throne room.</p>
<p><sup>A Game of Thrones, Eddard XI</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that the steps in the books are also taller than the whole chair in the show, implied from this quote.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Tywin rose to his feet. &quot;We continue,&quot; he said in a clear strong voice that silenced the murmurs. &quot;Those who wish to ask pardon for their treasons may do so. We will have no more follies.&quot; <strong>He moved to the Iron Throne and there seated himself on a step, a mere three feet off the floor.</strong></p>
<p><sup>A Clash of Kings, Sansa VIII</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The height of the Iron Throne is again implied in the following quotes and a higher throne means more swords gone into it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Her prince—no, her king now!—<strong>took the steps of the Iron Throne two at a time</strong>, while his mother was seated with the council.</p>
<p><sup>A Game of Thrones, Sansa V</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You let my father die,&quot; Joffrey said accusingly from <strong>atop the Iron Throne.</strong> &quot;You're too old to protect anybody.&quot;</p>
<p><sup>A Game of Thrones, Sansa V</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>height of the Iron Throne</strong> gave Joffrey a better vantage point than anyone else in the hall. He was the first to see her. &quot;Come forward, my lady,&quot; he called out, smiling.</p>
<p><sup>A Game of Thrones, Sansa V</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From Tyrion's perspective it is especially high, making him cramp as he climbs it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Iron Throne of Aegon the Conqueror was a tangle of nasty barbs and jagged metal teeth waiting for any fool who tried to sit too comfortably, and <strong>the steps made his stunted legs cramp as he climbed up to it</strong>, all too aware of what an absurd spectacle he must be. Yet there was one thing to be said for it. <strong>It was high</strong>.</p>
<p><sup>A Clash of Kings, Tyrion VI</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>The show even makes at least 2 jokes about the Iron Throne being different. The first is mentioned by Skooba below and is in Season 3 in an exchange between Littlefinger and Varys.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Varys:</strong> 1000 blades taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies, forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread.</p>
<p><strong>Littlefinger:</strong> There aren't There aren't even 200. I've counted.</p>
<p><strong>Varys:</strong> Ha, I'm sure you have. Ugly old thing. Yet it has a certain appeal. The Lysa Arryn of chairs. Shame you had to settle for your second choice.</p>
<p><sub><em>Game of Thrones</em>, Season 3 Episode 6, &quot;the Climb&quot;</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second is in the final episode of the series when Dany is talking to Jon in the now mostly destroyed Red Keep.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Daenerys:</strong> When I was a girl, my brother told me it was made with 1000 swords from Aegon's fallen enemies. What do 1000 swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can't count to 20? I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb. So many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of Aegon's feet.</p>

Arya takes pulls out her sword, ""Needle"", from her crate and then someone (a child?) approaches her, Arya ends up stabbing him with her sword (Needle).

<p>Needle went through his leather jerkin and the white flesh of his belly and came out between his shoulder blades. The boy dropped the pitchfork and made a soft noise, something between a gasp and a sigh.<br />

Blood had gushed from the boy's mouth as he collapsed, and more was seeping from the slit in his belly, pooling beneath his body. His palms were cut where he'd grabbed at the blade. She backed away slowly, Needle red in her hand.<br />

It would be so easy to hide here, as she had hidden from the wizard and the man with the forked beard. She could almost see the stableboy standing against the wall, his hands curled into claws with the blood still dripping from the deep gashes in his palms where Needle had cut him.<br />
[...]<br />
The memory made Arya smile, and after that the darkness held no more terrors for her. The stableboy was dead, she'd killed him, and if he jumped out at her she'd kill him again. She was going home. Everything would be better once she was home again, safe behind Winterfell's grey granite walls.<br />

"176100","Where is Valyria located in the world of Planetos?","<p>I was recently having a discussion with another user about whether or not the Doom of Valyria could have had a hand in the odd season lengths that occur in Westeros.

For more information see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_winter"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nuclear Winter</a>.

"176262","When was Robert Baratheon's coronation?","<p>During the rebellion Tywin Lannister and Eddard Stark were at King's Landing during the demise of the Mad King Aerys as Robert was injured during the Battle of the Trident. </p>

<p>I know dates are not precise within the books, but it was said Joffrey should be crowned within a fortnight after Robert's death. Due to to his incapacity, do we know how long after the Sack of King's Landing Robert received his crown? </p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><time>","176263","<h1>We Don't Know</h1>

<p>I was thinking about this yesterday as we know when Aegon's coronation was (I mean it's obvious the first day of the first month of 1 AC) so was wondering if we had any information on Robert's one.</p>

<p>I have tweeted Elio and Linda of westeros.org and they have come back saying we have no known date for the coronation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>@westerosorg Hello! Do we know the date of Robert's coronation? I've looked on the wiki and had a scan through the books but all I can find is late 283 AC.</em><br>

<p>What follows is speculation on my part for when the coronation could have happened.</p>

<h1>A Song of Ice and Fire</h1>

<p>The <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Robert_I_Baratheon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wiki page on Robert</a> has this to say about his coronation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In late 283 AC, Robert was crowned king.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It gives no extra information on the date. However, we can also deduce that it must have been late 283 AC from the following information.</p>

<p>Joffrey wishes to be crowned within a fortnight and so must believe that the preparations are possible for this to happen. He says it as if it's possible but not always the case so I'd say 2-4 weeks of preparation is probably normal.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Joffrey stood. His red satin cape was patterned in gold thread; fifty roaring lions to one side, fifty prancing stags to the other. ""I command the council to make all the necessary arrangements for my coronation,"" the boy proclaimed. ""<strong>I wish to be crowned within the fortnight.</strong> Today I shall accept oaths of fealty from my loyal councillors.""<br>
  <sub>A Game of Thrones, Eddard XIV</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Daeron Targaryen was crowned within the 2-4 week window as well after learning of his fathers death and that includes travelling to and from Dragonstone so it certainly seems possible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>His son and heir, <strong>Prince Daeron, departed Dragonstone within the fortnight after learning of his father's demise and was swiftly crowned</strong> by the High Septon in the Red Keep. He chose to be crowned with his father's crown—a decision likely intended to quell any remaining doubts about his legitimacy.<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice and Fire, The Targaryen Kings: Daeron II</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Sack_of_King%27s_Landing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sack of King's Landing</a> was in 283 AC and was a race by the main rebellion forces of Baratheon/Stark/Arryn/Tully and the Lannister forces to who would get their first. The Lannister forces beat them there and were shortly followed by the main force. This force was led by Eddard Stark as Robert was injured and so we can assume that Robert needed extra time to get there. He would also need time to heal a bit as an injured king at his own coronation wouldn't be the best sight.</p>

<p>With all this information I'd speculate that Robert was crowned within 6-8 weeks of the Sack of King's Landing.</p>

<h1>Game of Thrones</h1>

<p>I won't repeat stuff here as most of the information is the same as the books including Joffrey wanting to be crowned within the fortnight.</p>

","<game-of-thrones>","40886","<p>The phrase <code>""A Lannister always pays his debts""</code> is meant to appeal to the greedy, and to sway them to overlook the reputation of being deceitful that the Lannisters may have, when it comes to bribery and making deals. This is, after all, the house that sacked King's Landing, murdered King Aerys, murdered the entire houses Tarbeck and Reyne. The saying is meant to assure people that whatever else happens, you will get your money.</p>

<p>This is also demonstrated several times, for example when Jaime pays the Bolton men the money he promised them for returning to Harrenhal to fetch Brienne, or when Tyrion pays Mord the gaoler at the Eyrie all the gold he carried with him (but he kept the silver).</p>

<p>It is also a part of their deceitful nature that while they may promise gold, that does not mean you are safe, like the silent threats that Jaime and Tyrion think during these exchanges. Jaime thinks that Tywin might fill someone's pockets with gold as he hangs him, and Tyrion offers to take Mord into his service to be able to exact revenge later on.</p>

<p>Later on, Tyrion-gone-mad also extends the saying to include revenge, meaning that ""A Lannister always pays his debts"" means that Lannisters always exacts revenge.</p>

<p>Either way, this saying is just a way for GRRM to strengthen the impression of the untrustworthy Lannisters. Trust them at your peril. </p>

But so far we have seen very little of what goes on in the Citadel in either the books or the TV show (this may be updated in the future). As far as we know currently, maesters can earn the following types of links in their chain:</p>

<li>Brass</li>

</ul>

<p>Note that we do not know the type of study associated with all these metals, and that there may well be other types of metal links not included in this list. It's quite plausible that the maesters in the Citadel, who are essentially cloistered academics, have taken the study of mathematics far beyond what is required for accountancy, land surveying, war, etc. - but this is currently <strong>unknown</strong> in book/TV canon.</p>

"247498","What does the training of the faceless men contain?","<p>We've seen Arya training with the Faceless men in Braavos. It was mostly serving, telling lies (the game she played with the waif) and fighting. But what does the training consist of to become a Faceless Men?</p>
<p>We see her, as an example, kill the Freys with poison and she was, when she was imitating Walder Frey, speaking with a different voice. So, what does the training to become a Faceless men include?</p>
<p>What I know so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fighting (when fighting Brienne, she says that 'no one' has taught her to fight like that, I understood it as a reference to Jaqen H'gar)</li>
<li>Lying (Game with the waif)</li>
<li>Acting (When she imitated the servant when killing Walder Frey and imitating Walder Frey)</li>
<li>Poisons (this is just an assumption, as she's killed the Freys with poison and I don't see anywhere else she could've learned this skill)</li>
<li>Handling dead people (we see her wash / prepare the dead)</li>
<li>Remove the face to be used later (Arya removed the face of the Waif, therefore needed the proper training)</li>
</ul>
<p>Anything else? Answer from the books / author is preferred, if none is available (as not all books are yet released), an answer from the tv series 'Games of Thrones' is accepted.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","247531","<p><strong>It seems like you have everything covered.</strong></p>
<p>Going by both tags being used I am going to cross-reference the show to the books as you seem to be well versed in show lore.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Fighting</strong></p>
<p>Arya is trained with a stick (I'd say like a Bo staff) while she is blind to learn how to tell where opponent is without seeing them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And moving. She stepped to one side, grabbed for her stick, snapped it up to protect her face. Wood clacked against wood. The force of the blow almost knocked the stick from her hand. She held on, slashed back … and found only empty air where he should have been. &quot;Not there,&quot; the voice said. &quot;Are you blind?&quot;</p>
<p>She did not answer. Talking would only muddle any sounds he might be making. He would be moving, she knew. Left or right? She jumped left, swung right, hit nothing. A stinging cut from behind her caught her in the back of the legs. &quot;Are you deaf?&quot; She spun, the stick in her left hand, whirling, missing. From the left she heard the sound of laughter. She slashed right.</p>
<p>This time she connected. Her stick smacked off his own. The impact sent a jolt up her arm. &quot;Good,&quot; the voice said.</p>
<p><sub><em>A Dance with Dragons - The Blind Girl</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Lying</strong></p>
<p>Lying is one of the first skills Arya learns from both &quot;the kindly man&quot; and &quot;the waif&quot;. This continues for most of her training.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You lie,&quot; said the waif. &quot;You must lie gooder.&quot;</p>
<p>Arya laughed. &quot;Gooder? You mean better, stupid.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Better stupid. I will show you.&quot;</p>
<p>The next day they began the lying game, asking questions of one another, taking turns. Sometimes they would answer truly, sometimes they would lie. The questioner had to try and tell what was true and what was false. The waif always seemed to know. Arya had to guess. Most of the time she guessed wrong.</p>
<p><sub><em>A Feast for Crows - Arya II</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Acting</strong></p>
<p>Arya goes through a few &quot;roles&quot; during training notably &quot;Cat of the Canals&quot; and &quot;Beth&quot;. She uses these disguises to infiltrate different parts of Braavos.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Poisons</strong></p>
<p>Arya helps the waif prepare poisons and the waif teaches her what to smell for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Her part was mostly fetching, scrambling up ladders to find the herbs and leaves the waif required. &quot;Sweetsleep is the gentlest of poisons,&quot; the waif told her, as she was grinding some with a mortar and pestle. &quot;A few grains will slow a pounding heart and stop a hand from shaking, and make a man feel calm and strong. A pinch will grant a night of deep and dreamless sleep. Three pinches will produce that sleep that does not end. The taste is very sweet, so it is best used in cakes and pies and honeyed wines. Here, you can smell the sweetness.&quot; She let her have a whiff, then sent her up the ladders to find a red glass bottle. &quot;This is a crueler poison, but tasteless and odorless, hence easier to hide. The tears of Lys, men call it. Dissolved in wine or water, it eats at a man's bowels and belly, and kills as a sickness of those parts. Smell.&quot; Arya sniffed, and smelled nothing. The waif put the tears to one side and opened a fat stone jar. &quot;This paste is spiced with basilisk blood. It will give cooked flesh a savory smell, but if eaten it produces violent madness, in beasts as well as men. A mouse will attack a lion after a taste of basilisk blood.&quot;</p>

</li>
<li><p><strong>Handling dead people</strong></p>
<p>This is essential task of Arya's time as an acolyte. She assists visitors to the House of Black and White receive their &quot;gift&quot;. Their bodies are taken to the crypts where they are further processed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dead were never hard to find. They came to the House of Black and White, prayed for an hour or a day or a year, drank sweet dark water from the pool, and stretched out on a stone bed behind one god or another. They closed their eyes, and slept, and never woke. &quot;The gift of the Many-Faced God takes myriad forms,&quot; the kindly man told her, &quot;but here it is always gentle.&quot; When they found a body he would say a prayer and make certain life had fled, and Arya would fetch the serving men, whose task it was to carry the dead down to the vaults. There acolytes would strip and wash the bodies. The dead men's clothes and coins and valuables went into a bin for sorting. Their cold flesh would be taken to the lower sanctum where only the priests could go; what happened in there Arya was not allowed to know.</p>
<p><sub><em>A Feast for Crows - Arya II</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Removing Faces</strong></p>
<p>She learns this process as she goes through her own transformation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Still as stone, she thought. She sat unmoving. The cut was quick, the blade sharp. By rights the metal should have been cold against her flesh, but it felt warm instead. She could feel the blood washing down her face, a rippling red curtain falling across her brow and cheeks and chin, and she understood why the priest had made her close her eyes. When it reached her lips the taste was salt and copper. She licked at it and shivered.</p>
<p>&quot;Bring me the face,&quot; said the kindly man. The waif made no answer, but she could hear her slippers whispering over the stone floor. To the girl he said, &quot;Drink this,&quot; and pressed a cup into her hand. She drank it down at once. It was very tart, like biting into a lemon. A thousand years ago, she had known a girl who loved lemon cakes. No, that was not me, that was only Arya.</p>
<p>&quot;Mummers change their faces with artifice,&quot; the kindly man was saying, &quot;and sorcerers use glamors, weaving light and shadow and desire to make illusions that trick the eye. These arts you shall learn, but what we do here goes deeper. Wise men can see through artifice, and glamors dissolve before sharp eyes, but the face you are about to don will be as true and solid as that face you were born with. Keep your eyes closed.&quot; She felt his fingers brushing back her hair. &quot;Stay still. This will feel queer. You may be dizzy, but you must not move.&quot;</p>
<p>Then came a tug and a soft rustling as the new face was pulled down over the old. The leather scraped across her brow, dry and stiff, but as her blood soaked into it, it softened and turned supple. Her cheeks grew warm, flushed. She could feel her heart fluttering beneath her breast, and for one long moment she could not catch her breath. Hands closed around her throat, hard as stone, choking her. Her own hands shot up to claw at the arms of her attacker, but there was no one there. A terrible sense of fear filled her, and she heard a noise, a hideous crunching noise, accompanied by blinding pain. A face floated in front of her, fat, bearded, brutal, his mouth twisted with rage. She heard the priest say, &quot;Breathe, child. Breathe out the fear. Shake off the shadows. He is dead. She is dead. Her pain is gone. Breathe.&quot;</p>
<p>The girl took a deep shuddering breath, and realized it was true. No one was choking her, no one was hitting her. Even so, her hand was shaking as she raised it to her face. Flakes of dried blood crumbled at the touch of her fingertips, black in the lantern light. She felt her cheeks, touched her eyes, traced the line of her jaw. &quot;My face is still the same.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is it? Are you certain?&quot;</p>
<p>Was she certain? She had not felt any change, but maybe it was not something you could feel. She swept a hand down across her face from top to bottom, as she had once seen Jaqen H'ghar do, back at Harrenhal. When he did it, his whole face had rippled and changed. When she did it, nothing happened.</p>
<p>&quot;It feels the same.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To you,&quot; said the priest. &quot;It does not look the same.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To other eyes, your nose and jaw are broken,&quot; said the waif. &quot;One side of your face is caved in where your cheekbone shattered, and half your teeth are missing.&quot;</p>
<p>She probed around inside her mouth with her tongue, but found no holes or broken teeth. Sorcery, she thought. I have a new face. An ugly, broken face.</p>

"177217","Can a non-Targaryen ride a dragon?","<p>We see lot of speculation about who will ride Daenerys' dragons.</p>

<p>One of the candidates is Tyrion, but he is not a Targaryen. Jon Snow is also a candidate, but he is only half-Targaryen.</p>

<p>I am not here for speculation, but to ask a simple question:  </p>

<p><strong><em>Must one be a (pure) Targaryen to ride dragons?</em></strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","177222","<p><strong>TL;DR :</strong> Noble dragonriders may not have been exclusively Targaryen but all were Valyrian. Furthermore, there have been some bastard dragonriders, called dragonseeds, of unknown origin.</p>

<p><strong>Long answer :</strong> </p>

<p>There is a little bit of speculation in the answer, as it is not etched in stone that one can ride a dragon only if he is valyrian, but as there is a limited amount of dragons and dragonriders, we know individually each dragonriders (at least in post-doom era)</p>

<p>As far as I know, all known noble dragonriders where Valyrian. There are also some bastards who became dragonriders, called <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragonseed"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dragonseeds</a> ( bastards of House Targaryen as well as House Velaryon), even though we are not 100% sure of their origin.</p>

<p>Of course, the Targaryen are the most famous dragonriders, but there are others as well.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jaenara_Belaerys"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Jaenara Belaerys</a> flew over Sothoryos with his dragon.</li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aurion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Aurion, Emperor of Valyria</a>, is a famous dragonlord that survived the Doom of Valyria, proclaimed himself Emperor of Valyria, and tried to reestablish the Freehold. </li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Velaryon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">House Velaryon</a>, A Valyrian noble House who, like the Targaryan, left Valyria before the Doom. They are allied with Targaryens, and there have been a number of dragonriders from this house.</li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragonseed"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dragonseeds</a>, alleged Valyrian bastards who became dragonriders during the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dance_of_the_Dragons"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dance of the Dragons</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The only potential non-Valyrian dragonriders are the dragonseeds, because we don't really know the lineage of those bastards. </p>

<p>Usually, the term of dragonseed is used for Targaryan and Velaryon bastards, but the term was also used to call the dragonriders during the dance of the dragons. </p>

<p>Long story short, there was a civil war between Targaryens, and the black (Rhaenyra Targaryen's loyalists) had more dragons than dragonriders. Prince <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jacaerys_Velaryon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Jacaerys Velaryon</a> offered lands, riches, and knighthood to any such ""seeds"" that could master a dragon. A lot of men tried, a lot of men failed. </p>

<p>Those who succeeded were known as dragonseeds, but we don't know for sure if they were all Targaryens/ Velaryons or if it's their alleged Valyrian blood which enabled them to ride a dragon. Another thing to note is that not all of them had Valyran traits (Silver-gold hair, purple eyes etc.).</p>

<p>The best example is <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Nettles"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Nettles</a> : She is described as a ""brown-skinned girl with black hair and brown eyes"", not your typical Targaryen. </p>

<p>So, to sum up, all noble dragonriders were valyrian, and bastards dragonriders were supposed to be Valyrian as well, but not all of them had strong valyrian traits, so in conclusion:</p>

<ol>
<li>Only Valyrians can master the dragons. </li>
<li>Valyrians don't need to be pure-blooded to accomplish that feat.</li>

"41519","Why did Ser Gregor kill Ser Hugh?","<p>During the Tournament in honour of Ned Starks appointment to Hand of the King (<em><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tourney_of_the_Hand"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Tourney of The Hand</a></em>), Ser Gregor kills <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Hugh"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ser Hugh of the Vale</a> in what seems to be an accident.<br>
However, both Ned Stark and Ser Gregor's brother - Sandor ""The Hound"" Clegane - seem to think that this was not an accident, and we are also lead to believe that it is not. Ned Stark seems to think that Ser Hugh was killed because Ned had wanted to question him.</p>

<p>However, in retrospect (ASOS), we know that it was not Cersei who killed Jon Arryn, we only know that she suspected that Jon Arryn and Stannis knew the secret of who really fathered her children. </p>

<p>I can imagine that Cersei would possibly have had Ser Hugh killed, just in case he actually knew something that she suspected Jon Arryn or Stannis might have suspected, but why would she do it at that time? And why use Ser Gregor in that case? </p>

<p>Looking back at it now, it seems that it is more likely that this was purely coincidental. If Cersei had suspected that Ser Hugh knew <em>anything</em>, she would have had him killed right away. And frankly, it could have been done at any time, and not at the tournament in front of half of King's Landing, done by her own father's bannerman.</p>

<p><strong>What was the reason for Ser Gregor killing Ser Hugh?</strong></p>

<p>Anything is possible, but I prefer having some evidence to support speculation. My personal opinion is that Ser Gregor would not take killing orders from just anyone. The man is not an idiot. It would have to be a Lannister, or someone like Pycelle who is a Lannister loyalist. </p>

<p>It seems that GRRM has left this particular event unexplained, when so many other events were actually explained. For example, we heard who sent the assassin to kill Bran, we have some clue as to what Ned promised Lyanna, we know who poisoned Jon Arryn and who gave the order, we know that Cersei tried to have all of Robert's bastards killed, etc. But no hint as to why this incident happened, besides the obvious?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","42541","<p>This is pure speculation - and based on circumstantial evidence - but I suspect it was actually Littlefinger who was the orchestrator of Hugh's death. Firstly (and this is purely circumstantial), he adequately blocks Ned's first attempt to question Hugh. If you'll remember, when Ned announces his intentions to question Ser Hugh, it is Littlefinger who persuades him that he has to tread carefully. He advises Ned to send a trusted advisor to talk to Hugh, rather than go himself. Now, Littlefinger is an accomplished player of ""the game"" and I'm sure he would therefore have known all about the prickly disposition of Ser Hugh, and that he wouldn't answer the questions put to him by Jory (bit of a stretch here maybe, but I do think it extremely likely that Littlefinger would have known this). </p>

<p>Therefore it is my opinion that what initially appears to the reader to be helpful advice from Littlefinger (that Ned should question Ser Hugh but do so carefully) is now (in view of what we subsequently learn about him) revealed to be a skilful manipulation of someone unaccustomed to the game - and it is a great delaying tactic in terms of preventing Ned from actually learning anything from Ser Hugh. Now Littlefinger knows he has to resolve the situation before Ned can speak to Ser Hugh - and he has just enough time to set up the killing at the Tourney by Ser Gregor. Remember Clegane's status as an unpredictable wildcard here - given his nature it wouldn't have taken much convincing to get Ser Gregor to kill someone, so we needn't assume that he was acting to kill Ser Hugh on the orders of Cersei. Perhaps even the mere suggestion that the (unjustly) arrogant and jumped-up Ser Hugh should be cut down would be enough to get Ser Gregor to carry out the act.</p>

<p>So this leave Littlefinger's motivations as the loose end. Why does he need to do any of this? Well, we know that he wanted Arryn out of the way in order to marry his wife Lisa and later lay claim to the Vale. But we also know that, contrary to what he tells Lisa, Jon is not the only obstacle to his marrying her - what he needs is a title. At this moment he is still lowly Petyr Baelish of the Fingers. He won't become a viable suitor for her hand in marriage until he is nominated as Lord of Harrenhal, and for that to happen he is reliant on Cersei and her offspring maintaining their grip on the throne in the short term. What Arryn might have surmised about the Lannister children thus represented a severe threat to Littlefinger's plans - so perhaps Ser Hugh's killing wasn't necessary to protect Cersei and the Lannisters per se, but rather necessary to protect the Lannisters for the benefit of Littlefinger. A case of interests being aligned rather than the agency of one individual (Cersei) demanding the death of someone like Ser Hugh.</p>

<p>In general, what does the small council/High Septon et al do in situations like these?</p>

<p>What about the wardens or other lords and ladies of Westeros? What might they do? Would this affect them?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><politics>","110749","<p>If Tommen and Margaery both die, Stannis is the next in line for the throne (assuming he's also alive). If Stannis is also dead, then the answer depends on which medium you're talking about, (in the books, it's Shireen). Who's in line <em>after</em> Shireen is entirely unknown, because we don't know enough about Robert's family, but for practical purposes, it likely wouldn't matter.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that we know his real parents, Tommen is still legally a Baratheon. His position on the throne comes from his father Robert. As far as we can tell, the Seven Kingdoms use a typical male primogeniture system where the line of succession is basically:</p>

<ul>
<li>The eldest male child of the monarch;</li>
<li>The eldest male child of the eldest male child of the monarch;</li>
<li>The eldest male child of <em>that</em> person, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you've followed the generations all the way down and run out of eldest male children, succession moves to that persons brothers, and then to that persons sisters. If there are none of those, you back up a generation and repeat the process.</p>

<p>So, Robert had two sons and a daughter. The line of succession was Joffrey, then Tommen, then Myrcella. (If Joffrey had given birth to a son, that boy would have been inserted before Tommen). If all three of those children are dead, you move up a generation, back to Robert, and go to the eldest brother.</p>

<p>This is exactly the reason that Eddard Stark claimed Stannis as the legitimate heir in the first place: if none of Robert's children are true-born, they don't count, and Stannis is next in line. If all of Robert's children are dead, then their legitimacy is irrelevant, and Stannis inherits anyway.</p>

<p>If Stannis is also dead, we repeat that process, starting from him as King; his only child is Shireen, who would become Queen. </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Note that she's dead in the show but <em>probably</em> going to die in the books.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After that, things get very complicated. We would need to follow the family tree up to Robert's parents, who are obviously dead, and look for any uncles Robert might have had and track <em>their</em> children down. As far as I know, Robert's father and grandfather were both only children meaning it's going to take a lot of family-tree searching to find a legitimate heir. But at this point, if the line of succession gets this muddled, for all <em>practical</em> purposes it's basically ended. </p>

<p>People who are already close to the throne (particularly Cersei and Margaery's families) would probably begin to press claims for inheritance on their own. <em>Normally</em> a woman can't ""marry into"" the line of succession, Cersei can't be Queen on her own, but her daughter can, but when things get this murky, the rules tend to take a back seat to the people with the biggest armies.</p>

<p>In addition, this is the point where known bastard children would come into play. People like Edric, who is not in line for the throne legally but <em>is</em> Robert's child, become a huge political rallying point when the throne becomes heavily contested. They can make the argument that they're <em>closer</em> to the throne than anyone actually in the line of succession, and a lot of people would back them up.</p>

<p>So, <em>if</em> it happens that Tommen dies without producing an heir, the most likely outcome is various powerful houses (the Lannisters, Tyrells and the Baratheon's sworn houses w/ Edric Storm) going to war, again, until one of them has enough military and political support to simply declare themselves King and everyone will accept it and move on.</p>

<p>Who were these characters? Were they named? Also, can they be seen in the party that left the Wall in another moment other than their death?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","177972","<h1>Thoros of Myr, Viserion, Benjen Stark (Coldhands) and 7 red shirts</h1>

<p>The first casualty is the lead scout who gets killed by the wight bear whilst running back to the main group.</p>

<p>After that the bear is killed by Jorah with his dragonglass dagger and Thoros' wound is cauterised.</p>

<p>When the group ambush the White Walker/wight patrol it's not shown anyone dying so we can assume no one does. However, whilst they are running towards the island on the frozen lake one red shirt is killed by the wights.</p>

<p>The wights then attack the group of merry men on their little island and the group actually hold up relatively well. However, one red shirt get's rushed whilst using a spear and can't fight them off and ends up dying.</p>

<p>We then get a close scare with Tormund who is overcome by wights and even starts getting pulled into the water by some as the group starts to fallback. However, he is saved from becoming popsicle number 2 by Sandor. After that a red shirt helping Jon pull the captured wight further up the rock is rugby tackled off it into a group of waiting wights and mauled.</p>

<p>After this Dany arrives to rescue the remaining merry men with her dragons. The next casualty is then Viserion as he's flying when the world number one javelinist, the Night King, spears it under the wing.</p>

<p>At this point the main group escape and no one else is killed. Later on when the main group of wights has left the area Benjen Stark, Coldhands, appears and saves Jon. He puts Jon on his horse and stays to fend off the wights from chasing him. However, he is quickly overcome and is mauled to re-death. It has been confirmed that Benjen""met his end here"" in the DVD commentary for Season 7 by Alan Taylor.</p>

<p>As for whether any of the red shirts can be seen in a none fighting scene, there appear to have been 14 men in the merry men (assuming all the red shirts that are in the group are shown dying) including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jon Snow</li>
<li>Sandor Clegane</li>
<li>Tormund Giantsbane</li>
<li>Gendry</li>
<li>Beric Dondarrion</li>
<li>Thoros of Myr</li>
<li>Jorah Mormont</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not sure they are all shown before they die as there appear to be inconsistencies with how many are shown in the group. Though these could be explained away by the group having used scouts like the one who is first to die against the wight bear. For example, when the wight bear attacks we are shown 12 men when there should be 13 though I assume the last could be a rear scout and isn't with the main group.</p>

<p>That appears to be the best picture of the group all together. The following image shows there being around 8-10 people on the frozen lake. At this point 4 people have died with Thoros being fatally injured so there should be 10 people with 9 stood up and Thoros potentially stood or laying and the wight either on someone or on the floor. This could be me counting incorrectly or an inconsistency with how many people should be there but as it's not exactly that clear in the image it's hard to tell.</p>

"178042","Why don't the Targaryens have purple eyes?","<p>I recently saw <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/3379/58193"">this answer</a> which states the Targaryens in the show don't have purple eyes but they do in the books. I knew this to be the case but a quick search also proved it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""She has had her blood. She is old enough for the khal,"" Illyrio told him, not for the first time. ""Look at her. <strong>That silver-gold hair, those purple eyes … she is the blood of old Valyria</strong>, no doubt, no doubt … and highborn, daughter of the old king, sister to the new, she cannot fail to entrance our Drogo.""

  <sub>A Game of Thrones, Daenerys I</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've seen various posts talking about why the Targaryens don't have purple eyes in the show and they all boil down to the following points:</p>

<ul>
<li>They looked fake</li>
<li>Contact lenses were uncomfortable for the actors</li>
<li>CGI for them was too expensive for little gain</li>
<li>Contact lenses obscure ""eye acting""</li>
</ul>

<p>I've seen many people making these claims but have yet to have found a source for them, is there one?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[BENIOFF] I also remember even <strong>at one point we were trying out purple contacts for Daenerys</strong> and [Tyrion] was supposed to have one green eye and one brown eye. The reality of it is that a character who’s in the show as much as Peter is in the show, to be <strong>wearing colored contact lenses every day you shoot is a nightmare.</strong> But sticking to the letter of the books was important enough that that was all on the table. I think by the time Emilia [Clarke] came along we were off that idea. <strong>But in the initial pilot we see what acting with purple contacts can do to somebody and how much time they spend focusing on the fact that their eyes don’t feel right.</strong></p>

"178108","Are there any other unofficial House words?","<p>The <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_words"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">awoiaf page on House words</a> has a decent list of the words for some houses. It even lists House Lannister's unofficial words, which are spelled out in the show.</p>

<p>Are there any other houses with unofficial words?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","178109","<p>It seems unlikely that there are any other unofficial words when you consider George has created over 400 Houses. On top of that he hasn't even made up all the words for those ones. There are some big houses like House Frey that don't have words yet too.</p>

  <p><em>Could you tell us some of the family words for those families we haven't seen yet, for example the words of House Frey?</em><br>

<p>With that said George has suggested using ""Sapphires"" as a replacement for the words for House Tarth at a book signing as he hadn't come up with the words yet.</p>

  <p>When it was my husband's turn to get our books signed, he told him he wanted the Stark words in two books, and the Tarth words (whatever they were) in the third. <strong>George said that he hadn't ever come up with words for the Tarths (maybe he will, now!)

<p>This is only really an out of universe replacement rather than in universe unofficial words. However, sapphires are used by Jaime to keep him and Brienne safe by Vargo Hoat's men even though Tarth isn't called the Sapphire Isle for gemstones.</p>

It was hard to say how long he was gone, but when the pain spit him out, Urswyck was there, and Vargo Hoat himself. ""Thee'th not to be touched,"" the goat screamed, spraying spittle all over Zollo.

<p>However, there are several reasons as to why the Wall won't have nets:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's 700 ft high to successfully stop a suicide it would need more than one row of nets and each would be further out than the last</li>
<li>Suicide = desertion and desertion is punishable by death (though the watch is undermanned now so there's some leniency e.g. Jon)</li>
<li>The Wall is 300 miles long so that's a lot of nets to keep and maintain</li>
<li>The watch is severely undermanned and can't even maintain the trees growing near the Wall or all their castles, the nets are secondary compared to this</li>
<li>Don't want to protect the wildling climbers</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also some reasons as to why it would have them:</p>

<ul>
<li>Someone falling off accidentally or regretting the jump but unable to stop it</li>
<li>Someone being pushed off</li>
<li>They're short on men so someone saved is better than lost</li>

Shouldn't Robb have been married under the sight of the Old Gods as they are the Gods of his father? </p>

<p>Maybe there were no Weirwoods nearby to perform the ceremony. Maybe simply being in the south is enough to mandate a wedding by septon. Maybe the Faith of Seven is a quick ceremony so Robb and Talisa can get it on sooner. Maybe there is some actual reason?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","179341","<p>It appears as though Game of Thrones writer Bryan Cogman has already answered this one for us. Essentially they wanted to get married then and there and getting married in the light of the Seven was their best bet. He also alludes to Cat having been of the Seven and so that would play a part in it too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Justin:</strong> <em>Why were Robb and Talisa married in the light of the Seven rather than in front of a Heart Tree?</em></p>
<p><strong>Bryan:</strong> Shotgun wedding! Of sorts. They wanted to get married and there was a septon readily available. At any rate, Robb was raised in an interfaith household — he could very well have spent as much time with with Septon Chayle growing up as he did in the godswood. So I don’t see a problem with him having a Seven wedding. But I guess a lot of people do cuz I get asked that question all the time.</p>
<p>Now the line about Karstark praying to the Father in 208… yeah, I should’ve caught that. Karstark would be strictly Old Gods, I think.

<p>What is the meaning of this Sigil? What does the red three headed Dragon on a black field mean? Is there any significance?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","179531","<h3>The Three Headed Dragon</h3>
<p>It is a three headed dragon which stand for the three conquering dragons which were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Aegon the Conqueror</li>
<li>Visenya Targaryen (Who should be the one called the Conqueror instead of her brother)</li>
<li>Rhaenys Targaryen</li>
</ol>
<p>Since they are born of the same parents, they are one, but three. So therefore, a single dragon with three heads.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The dragon has three heads,” she sighed. “Do you know what that
means, Jorah?”</p>
<p>“Your Grace? The sigil of House Targaryen is a three-headed dragon,
red on black.”</p>
<p>“I know that. But there are no three-headed dragons.”</p>
<p><strong>“The three heads were Aegon and his sisters.”</strong></p>
<p>“Visenya and Rhaenys,” she recalled. “I am descended from Aegon and
Rhaenys through their son Aenys and their grandson Jaehaerys.”<br><sub><em><strong>ACOK- Daenerys V</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But of course we can say that Jorah may have been mistaken about it but there is nothing to indicate that he was.</p>
<p>In any case, there you have it. Three Conquerors, one realm. Three Royals, one Kingdom. Three persons, one family.</p>
<h3>Why choose that device?</h3>
<p>They chose it when they started conquering Westeros just to show their new subjects that they were adopting Westerosi customs and culture. The Targaryens did not have that sigil or any sigil at all prior to the conquest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Heraldic banners</strong> had long been a tradition amongst the lords of Westeros, but such <strong>had never been used by the dragonlords of old
Valyria</strong>. When Aegon’s knights unfurled his great silken battle
standard, with a red three-headed dragon breathing fire upon a black
field, the lords took it for a sign that he was now truly one of them,
a worthy high king for Westeros.<br><sub><em><strong>TWOIAF- The Reign of the Dragons:
The Conquest</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since Draconic symbols were associated with Valyria, a Dragon seems like a good choice for a heraldic device.</p>
<h3>The Words</h3>
<p>They did have words prior to that (Fire and Blood), which can be assumed to be, because Princess Meria Martell knew those words when Rhaenys threatened her with them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I will not fight you,&quot; Princess Meria told Rhaenys, &quot;nor will I kneel
to you. Dorne has no king. Tell your brother that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I shall,&quot; Rhaenys replied, &quot;but we will come again, Princess, and the
next time <strong>we shall come with fire and blood.</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Your words</strong>,&quot; said Princess Meria. &quot;Ours are Unbowed, Unbent,
Unbroken. You may burn us, my lady...but you will not bend us, break
us, or make us bow. This is Dorne. You are not wanted here. Return at
your peril.&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>TWOIAF- The Reign of the Dragons:
The Conquest</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Must be noted, however, that in ASOS Daenerys mistakenly thought that &quot;Blood and Fire&quot; were the Targaryen words.</p>
<h3>The Colors</h3>
<p>The choice of the colors, Red and Black, may have been due to their Valyrian background. Everything the Valyrians accomplished was due to the fire of their dragons and blood magic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What feeds a dragon's fire? All Valyrian sorcery was rooted in blood
or fire.<br><sub><em><strong>AFFC- Samwell V</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since red is associated with fire/blood and black is the color of soot (And also the fire of Balerion), that choice seems apt. However we must note this is my own speculation, GRRM is silent on the matter.</p>
<h3>Does it have anything to do with Rhaegar's prophecy?</h3>
<p>Presumably not. We still do not know if Rhaegar had full access to the prophecy or understood it properly. He was mistaken about it twice. First he thought he was the Prince that was promised. Then he thought it was his son Aegon. He was wrong the both times. Besides, as Tyrion says, a Prophecy is like a half trained mule, once you start trusting it, it will kick you in the head.</p>
<p>It is very unlikely that Aegon, Visenya and Rhaenys, who just improvised with a sigil out of political needs, read extensively on prophecies and made their sigil according to one, which did not necessarily talk about Valyrians or the Targaryens. Unlike the three conquerors, Rhaegar was so obsessed with books that people used to joke that the Queen must have swallowed some books and candles when she was pregnant with him. The same was never said about the three conquerors.</p>

"179590","Why do Northern houses see joining the Night's Watch as honorable while no one else does?","<p>In <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> (and also in the series <em>Game of Thrones</em>), ""taking the black"" by joining the Night's Watch <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Night&#39;s_Watch#Recruitment"" rel=""noreferrer"">was generally considered to be a very honorable thing to do despite that, in current times, it's seen as a ""last resort"" for criminals and disinherited people</a>. However, what strikes me as odd is that it seems that <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/5896/65294"">House Stark generally still sees joining the Night's Watch as honorable</a> despite this.</p>

<p>The Starks and other Northern houses are educated and probably know <em>more</em> about the realities of life as a member than other families of Westeros do due to actually having a border with the Watch's lands: They've actually <em>seen</em> all that stuff rather than just hearing about it... so they are most definitely aware that it's a dumping ground for the dregs of society and not some noble cause <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Night&#39;s_Watch#History"" rel=""noreferrer"">like it may be portrayed as in legends</a>. So, then, <strong>why do the Starks and other Northerners still consider joining the Night's Watch  to be an honorable act while it seems that no one else in Westeros does?</strong> Is it just because members of the Stark house invested a lot in it throughout history (e.g. <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Brandon_Stark_(Builder)"" rel=""noreferrer"">Bran the Builder</a>) and they're reluctant to ""give up"" on it as a sort of psychological sunk-cost fallacy?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","179594","<h2>The North remembers</h2>

<p>There is a long history to the Night's Watch, and the North remembers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thanks to the children, <strong>the first men of the Night's Watch banded together and were able to fight—and win—the Battle for the Dawn</strong>: the last battle that broke the endless winter and sent the Others fleeing to the icy north. Now, six thousand years later (or eight thousand as True History puts forward), the Wall made to defend the realms of men is still manned by the sworn brothers of the Night's Watch, and neither the Others nor the children have been seen in many centuries.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p>That [the Others] became monstrous in the tales told thereafter, according to Fomas, reflects the desire of <strong>the Night's Watch and the Starks to give themselves a more heroic identity as saviors of mankind</strong>, and not merely the beneficiaries of a struggle over dominion.<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice and Fire - Ancient History: The Long Night</sub></p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p>The history of the Night's Watch is a long one. Tales still tell of the black knights of the Wall and their noble calling. But the Age of Heroes is long done, and the Others have not shown themselves in thousands of years, if indeed they ever existed.<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice and Fire - The Wall and Beyond: The Night’s Watch</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Starks and the North remember the history upon which the Night's Watch was born. A brotherhood sworn to protect <em>everyone</em>, regardless of allegiances from the forgotten terror that lies in the forgotten North.</p>

<p>The allegiance of the Night's Watch to the realm is noted on by Visenya, when she models the Kingsguard vows after those of the Night's Watch. However instead of the realm, the Kingsguard are sworn to the King.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She modeled their vows upon those of the Night's Watch, so that they would forfeit all things save their duty to the king.<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice and Fire - The Targaryen Kings: Aegon I</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was the North that was directly in line to get <em>rekt</em> by the Others, and the Nights Watch were the ones protecting them:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The northern boundary of the Stark domains was protected by the Wall and the men of the Night's Watch<br>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's also a recognition that the wall has helped protect the North from wildling invasions much more recently than when the Others were last seen. It's an honorable (sic) calling for a younger son, who otherwise has few prospects, to take the black because of this history

<p>It is for the most part unclear why they honour it so, but just that they do.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wildling raids may rightly be considered more of a nuisance than a menace; many wise men suggest that they might be better dealt with by allowing the lords of the North to extend their rule beyond the Wall so that they can drive the wildlings back.<br>
  Only the fact that the Northmen themselves greatly honor the Watch has kept it functioning, and a great part of the food that keeps the black brothers of Castle Black, the Shadow Tower, and Eastwatch-by-the-Sea from starving comes not from the Gift but from the yearly gifts these Northern lords deliver to the Wall in token of their support.<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice and Fire - The Wall and Beyond: The Night’s Watch</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>The extent to which it was deemed honourable in the days of old is remarked on by Jon, when discussing the Shieldhall. Where the old Shields of knights and nobleman who'd given up their Houses for the black would hang their shields, until their death,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Shieldhall was one of the older parts of Castle Black, a long drafty feast hall of dark stone, its oaken rafters black with the smoke of centuries. <strong>Back when the Night's Watch had been much larger, its walls had been hung with rows of brightly colored wooden shields.</strong> Then as now, when a knight took the black, tradition decreed that he <strong>set aside his former arms and take up the plain black shield of the brotherhood.</strong> The shields thus discarded would hang in the Shieldhall.<br>
  Hundreds of knights meant hundreds of shields. Hawks and eagles, dragons and griffins, suns and stags, wolves and wyverns, manticores, ... , and a hundred other heraldic charges had adorned the Shieldhall walls, blazoned in more colors than any rainbow ever dreamed of.<br>
  But <strong>when a knight died, his shield was taken down, that it might go with him to his pyre or his tomb</strong>...<br>
  <sub>A Dance with Dragons: Jon XIII</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<hr> 

<p>The Southerners have long forgotten the threats of not only the Others, but of the Wildlings, they mostly consider it to be folk stories and old wives' tales. The Southron lords have only known the Northern realm to be their threat from the North (before Aegon's Landing) since the Night's Watch and the North had kept everything else at bay. This ignorance was, however, not always the case, as the description of the Shieldhall states, there were scores of houses once represented on the walls of the Hall.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hawks and eagles, dragons and griffins, suns and stags, wolves and wyverns, manticores, bulls, trees and flowers, harps, spears, crabs and krakens, red lions and golden lions and chequy lions, owls, lambs, maids and mermen, stallions, stars, buckets and buckles, flayed men and hanged men and burning men, axes, longswords, turtles, unicorns, bears, quills, spiders and snakes and scorpions<br>

"112301","In Game of Thrones, how difficult would it be to invade the Vale of Arryn through The Bite?","<p>My idea of the Vale, and the reason why it's considered impregnable without dragons (or maybe boats), is because of the bottleneck in the Bloody Gate; however, looking at a map of the area, it seems that it would be easy to bypass that bottleneck by entering the Vale through The Bite. It would be a longer walk to The Eyrie, but considering it wouldn't be that much longer, it looks like an obvious choice for an attack.</p>

<p>I'm assuming there's more to this than what I know from watching the show and looking at a map, so my question is: are there plausible reasons that would make The Bite a less preferable entry point than it looks at face value?</p>

<p>King <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Harmund_II_Hoare"" rel=""noreferrer"">Harmund II Hoare</a> created that heresy and adopted it. He was born an Ironman but was raised at Casterly Rock by the Lannister Kings so he observed the Andal religion very closely and when he came back to rule Iron Islands after his father died, the Andals had left a deep impression on him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His son Harmund the Haggler shared his love of reading, and became
renowned as a great traveler. He was the first king of the Iron
Islands to visit the green lands without a sword in his hand. Having
<strong>spent his youth as a ward of House Lannister</strong>, the second Harmund
returned to Casterly Rock as a king and took the Lady Lelia Lannister,
a daughter of the King of the Rock and &quot;the fairest flower of the
west,&quot; for his queen. On a later voyage he visited Highgarden and
Oldtown, to treat with their lords and kings and foster trade.<br><sub><em><strong>TWOIAF: The Iron Islands -  The Black Blood</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He formed a blend of both faiths and spoke of Eight Gods which were the seven Gods of the Andal faith plus the Drowned god of the Ironborn. According to him, There were eight Gods and each sept should have a statue of Drowned God as well. This offended both the Ironborn Priests and Septons alike. Seeing the things getting intense, the King later rescinded that proclamation but insisted that Like the Seven were different aspects of the same one God, Drowned God was one aspect of the Andal deity, the Stranger.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though Harmund II accepted the Seven as true gods, <strong>he continued to
do honor to the Drowned God as well, and on his return to Great Wyk
spoke openly of &quot;the Eight Gods,&quot;</strong> and decreed that <strong>a statue of the
Drowned God should be raised at the doors of every sept</strong>. This
pleased neither the septons nor the priests and was denounced by both.
In an attempt to placate them, the king rescinded his decree and
declared that god had but seven faces...but the Drowned God was one of
those, as an aspect of the Stranger.<br><sub><em><strong>TWOIAF: The Iron Islands -  The Black Blood</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Needless to say, his views were not popular and in the reign of his son, Harmund III, all hell broke lose. The Ironborn clergy deposed the King in a popular rebellion and mutilated him in inhuman fashion. This hybrid of the two faiths ended right there and then.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He was considering a measure to end the practice of thralldom on the
isles as well when a <strong>priest known as the Shrike began to preach</strong>
<strong>against him.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Other priests took up the cry</strong>, and the lords of the isles took heed. Only the septons and their followers stood by King Harmund, and
he was overthrown within a fortnight, almost bloodlessly. What
followed was far from bloodless, however. <strong>The Shrike himself tore
out the deposed king's tongue, so he might never again speak &quot;lies and
blasphemies.&quot;</strong> Harmund was blinded as well, and his nose was cut off,
so &quot;all men might see him for the monster he is.&quot;<br><sub><em><strong>TWOIAF: The Iron Islands -  The Black Blood</strong></em></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Faith of The Moonsingers</h3>
<p>This faith was founded by escaped Slaves of Valyria. They essentially combined the aspects of all the religions observed by the former Slaves who had escaped to Braavos. Quoting GRRM:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>Could you give us any information concerning the moonsingers that were key to the founding of Braavos?</strong></p>
<p>As you know, they were slaves who fled from Valyria and they found a
place as far away from Valyria that they could get. What basically
happened was that a Valyrian fleet, which was rowed by slaves, was
taken over by the slaves after they mutined. And they decided to get
as far away to the north as they could, sailing through the narrow sea
to find a refuge. The founded Braavos and kept the city secret for
about a hundred years. For those first hundred years, practically no
one knew of the city's existence. Because the city is founded by
slaves, it's not a homogenous population, <strong>there were slaves from all
sorts of different places with different ethnicities, different
homelands, different customs, different religions. So they create a
new religion, one with one god that can be applied to all the other
fatihs and is tolerant of all the other faiths.</strong><br><sub><em><strong><a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Asshai.com_Interview_in_Barcelona"" rel=""noreferrer"">So Spake Martin: Asshai.com Interview in Barcelona</a></strong></em></sub></p>

<hr />
<h3>Why are different sects not found in Planetosi religions</h3>
<p>This part is primarily my own speculation so you may choose to skip this.</p>
<p>The People of Planetos, like people of Medieval world, are very sensitive about the faiths. We see religious wars between Andal and First Men, Civil war fought between the clergy and crown when the crown tried to make an exception for the Royals in the matter of incest, Revolution against Ironborn King who was seen as going against the teachings of his faith.</p>
<p>A new faith cannot really survive and propagate without sufficient Political support. And Political leaders often tend to use the Clerics to their own ends. If common people do end up making a sect somehow, it would have been wiped out by Zealots.</p>
<p>But still it is interesting that we do not see the sects in Planetos really. Take Westeros for example:</p>
<ol>
<li>It has multiple cultures</li>
<li>A vast landmass</li>
<li>Communication difficulties i.e. traveling taking too long.</li>
<li>General populace more or less ignorant about mysteries of their faiths e.g. Commoners thinking that there are really Seven gods in the Faith of Seven when in fact there is only one who has seven aspects.</li>
<li>There is general discontent about corruption rampant in the Faith</li>
</ol>
<p>This is ripe ground for emergence of new sects in the remote and isolated communities. But yet we do not see any such developments. We can assume that's probably because the grip of clergy is tighter than we believe it is. And of course, before Jaehaerys I, the Faith had her own swords to sort out Heretics anywhere at will.</p>
<p>But a more logical reason appears to be the Author's choice. He prefers to write more about secular stuff instead of religious one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q: How important is religion and myth in your stories?</strong></p>
<p>GRRM: Mythos is important and it can also be very difficult. An
author’s beliefs color the character, audience’s beliefs color it.
<strong>Easier for me to write a secular character or someone who mocks and insults the gods than it is to write a sincerely devout character.</strong>
It’s a secular society, especially our sf/fantasy readers.<br><sub><em><strong><a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Odyssey_Con_2008_Madison_WI_April_4_6_20081"" rel=""noreferrer"">So Spake Martin: Odyssey Con 2008 (Madison, WI; April 4-6 2008)

"179641","What is the Northern equivalent to a Knight?","<p>In Westeros Knighthood is closely bound to the Faith of the Seven and as the majority of the North still follows the Old Gods they don't appear to have knights.

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Can someone who keeps to the old gods be made a knight too or is it a exclusive of the Seven?</em></p>

<p>The Northern cavalry appears to be the closest we have to what Knights are in the North. They appear to serve as the same function as Knights do in the Southern armies but just don't carry the title.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""How many knights?""</p>
  
  <p>""Few enough,"" the maester said with a touch of impatience. ""To be a knight, you must stand your vigil in a sept, and be anointed with the seven oils to consecrate your vows. In the north, only a few of the great houses worship the Seven. The rest honor the old gods, and name no knights … but those lords and their sons and sworn swords are no less fierce or loyal or honorable. A man's worth is not marked by a ser before his name. As I have told you a hundred times before.""</p>
  
  <p>""Still,"" said Bran, ""how many knights?""</p>
  
  <p>Maester Luwin sighed. ""<strong>Three hundred, perhaps four … among three thousand armored lances who are not knights.</strong>""</p>

<p>The differences here appear to be that the Northern Cavalry:</p>

<li>Aren't titled as Ser</li>
<li>Don't create a House/Sigil</li>
<li>Don't have the same social status as actual Knights</li>

<p>It's worth mentioning that ""Northern cavalry"" appears to be a term made up for the wiki to give the page a title and isn't actually canonical. They are usually just referred to be description such as Maester Luwin calling them ""armored lances who are not knights"".</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.dictionary.com/browse/knight"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dictionary.com</a> also has the following definitions to what a Knight is. Some of the points fit the description of what the Cavalry are though obviously not all of them do.</p>

  <li>(in Europe in the Middle Ages) a man, usually of noble birth, who after an apprenticeship as page and squire was raised to honorable military rank and bound to chivalrous conduct.</li>

<p>While <em>The World of Ice and Fire</em> is a book about the entire history of Westeros, a large portion of it based on Aegon's Conquest and the Targaryen Kings. Since this takes place before the TV show, the histories are almost certainly 100% accurate to the Game of Thrones canon, even if the show has a slightly different canon.</p>

<p>Parts II - IV are titled the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Reign of the Dragons</strong>, telling about Aegon's Conquest</li>
<li><strong>The Targaryen Kings</strong>, about the reigns of all Targaryen kings, beginning with King Aegon I Targaryen and ending with the reign of King Aerys II Targaryen</li>
<li><strong>The Fall of the Dragons</strong>, about the year of the false spring, Robert's Rebellion, and its aftermath.</li>
</ul>

<p>You would most likely be interested in the first two/three chapters of the part titled <strong>""The Targaryen Kings""</strong>. This is about the events directly after the conquest during the Reign of Aegon I, Aenys I and Maegor I</p>

<ul>
<li>Aegon I Targaryen - The first King of Westeros and the telling of the time straight after his coronation</li>
<li>Aenys I Targaryen - Aegon I's heir, and the second King of Westeros. This gives us a little more insight into his life and the rule between the years 37 and 42 AC.</li>
<li>Maegor I Targaryen - Known commonly as ""<em>The Cruel</em>"" the rise of Maegor to the crown is an interesting tail and the differences in leading the people is an interesting read in it's own right.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that because the show uses a different scale of the years (After Landing as opposed to After Conquest) the years might not match up by a value of 2, (if something took place in 1 AC it's probably something like -1 AL) but over the 281 year rule of the Targayens, 2 years doesn't make much difference.</p>

  <p>So many stars, he thought as he trudged up the slope through pines and
  firs and ash. Maester Luwin had taught him his stars as a boy in
  Winterfell; he had learned the names of the twelve houses of heaven
  and the rulers of each; he could find the seven wanderers sacred to
  the Faith; he was old friends with the Ice Dragon, the Shadowcat, the
  Moonmaid, and the Sword of the Morning. All those he shared with
  Ygritte, but not some of the others. We look up at the same stars, and
  see such different things. The King's Crown was the Cradle, to hear
  her tell it; the Stallion was the Horned Lord; the red wanderer that
  septons preached was sacred to their Smith up here was called the
  Thief. And when the Thief was in the Moonmaid, that was a propitious
  time for a man to steal a woman, Ygritte insisted. ""Like the night you
  stole me. The Thief was bright that night.""<br>

<p>So, as astronomy is quite important, are there any buildings other than the Citadel that are dedicated to stargazing?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","179728","<p>Maester Luwin appears to have an observatory in Winterfell and even mentions having received a new lens for it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""There was no rider, my lord. Only a carved wooden box, left on a table in <strong>my observatory</strong> while I napped. My servants saw no one, but it must have been brought by someone in the king's party. We have had no other visitors from the south.""<br>
  ""A wooden box, you say?"" Catelyn said.<br>
  ""Inside was a <strong>fine new lens for the observatory</strong>, from Myr by the look of it. <strong>The lenscrafters of Myr are without equal.</strong>""<br>

<p>These lenscrafters likely make the lenses for the Far-eyes/Myrish eyes too, hence the name. These are basically telescopes and used by sailors quite a lot as well as the maesters. Maester Luwin's and Maester Aemon's Myrish eye's are also both on tripods so are likely more permanent features of the room/building.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Maester Luwin's turret was so cluttered that it seemed to Bran a wonder that he ever found anything. Tottering piles of books covered tables and chairs, rows of stoppered jars lined the shelves, candle stubs and puddles of dried wax dotted the furniture, <strong>the bronze Myrish lens tube sat on a tripod</strong> by the terrace door, star charts hung from the walls, shadow maps lay scattered among the rushes, papers, quills, and pots of inks were everywhere, and all of it was spotted with droppings from the ravens in the rafters.<br>

<hr>

<p>On a side note astronomy in Westeros is only really important to the Maesters as they use it to tell the time/passing of the months. Many other people use far-eyes as we would use them to see further, scout ahead and keep a look out. Note that far-eyes here refers to the people using the Myrish eyes.</p>

"179855","Is the Westerosi heraldry similar to western europe medieval heraldry?","<p>Similar to our world, heraldry play an important role to distinguish noble Houses or singular character. But did the westerosi heraldry follow the same rules as ours ?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","179856","<p><strong>TLDR</strong>: 
Inspired, but not similar in all points</p>

<p><strong>Long answer</strong>: </p>

<p>There are some diferences between westerosi and european heraldry, as there are lot of rules in real world that are not followed in westeros: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>No particular jargon: In our world, there is a particular jargon to describe coats of arms, for colors and figures. For example, we don't say ""a golden lion on red background"" but ""gules, a lion or"". Westerosi seems to lack this specific kinds of terms</p></li>
<li><p>Rule of tincture: One basic rule of heraldry is the rule of tincture: metal should not be put on metal, nor colour on colour. Metal refers to gold and silver, while colors are azure(blue), gules(red), sable(black), vert(green) and purpure(purple). 
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/puUTh.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/puUTh.png"" alt=""tincture""></a></p></li>

<ul>
<li>Limited number of tinctures: in real world, there are only two metals and five colors, and for example, two variant of greens are both considered ""vert"". Therefore, some sigils like Stark's (as grey and white are both considered ""argent"") or Duncan's(using a color gradient) don't follow the rules.</li>

"179880","Is the North still in open rebellion?","<p>After King Robb died at the Red Wedding and Roose Bolton becomes Warden of the North, there is no one in the North claiming to be a king.</p>

<p>When Sansa marries Roose Bolton's son Ramsay Bolton she comes in contact with some people from the North that say 'the North remembers"". Does this mean they are still actively fighting the crown and the Warden of the North? Or are they waiting for someone to take leadership over the rebellion?</p>

<p>Of course, when Jon defeats Ramsay and is named King of the North, they are back into obvious open rebellion.</p>

<p><strong>After the death of King Robb and before the crowning of King Jon is the North in open rebellion against the crown?</strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones>","179882","<p>Starks ruled the North for thousands of years so the populace finds it really hard to imagine a North without them to lead her. </p>

<p>This is true not just for the peasants but also for the nobles (Re: Lyanna Mormont's letter to Stannis that Bear Island knows no King but King in the North whose name is Stark). Everyone knows what <em>actually</em> happened at the Red Wedding but they were all afraid of Roose Bolton to do anything about it.</p>

<p>The entire strengths of noble Houses were slaughtered at the Red Wedding. When Robb went to war, he took the most likely soldiers with him. The rest were tired after bitter fighting with the Ironborn. There wasn't really anyone left to openly take the field against Boltons and no one to unite them under one flag. Some Lords were bold enough to refuse paying taxes but even they learnt their lesson soon.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Roose</strong>: We can't hold the North with terror alone. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Ramsay</strong>: You can't hold the North if you let these lesser lords insult us. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Roose</strong>: I sent you there to collect taxes, not bodies. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Ramsay</strong>:  Lord Cerwyn (Thanks to @<a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/87517/kepotx"">Kepotx</a>) refused to pay. He said the Warden of the North will always
  be a Stark, and he'd be damned if he kissed a traitor's boot. You left
  him no choice. I flayed him living, along with his wife and brother. I
  made his son watch.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Roose</strong>: And? </p>
  
  <p><strong>Ramsay</strong>: The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Roose Bolton however was not in rebellion. He was appointed the Crown's Warden of the North and he held his office in the name of his Grace, Joffrey and afterwards Tommen of the Houses Baratheon and Lannister.</p>

<p>He trusted Lord Tywin but after his death, he wasn't so sure. He needed the Stark name to legitimize his rule and that of his children. Which is why he made a deal with Petyr Baelish. It was all purely political.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Baelish</strong>: Tyrion never consumated the marriage. By the law of the land,
  she's no man's wife. Inspect her, if you must. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Roose</strong>: I leave that to the brothel keeper. It's her name I need, not
  her virtue.<br><sub><strong>Season 5: Episode 3</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But he still had his reservations:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Roose</strong>: When the Lannisters hear I've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Baelish</strong>: The Lannister name doesn't mean what it once did. Tywin is
  dead. He kept his house in power through sheer will. Without him,
  Jaime has one hand and no allies, Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to
  fear. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Roose</strong>: The Queen will be enraged. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Baelish</strong>: Queen Margaery adores Sansa. Cersei is Queen Mother, a title
  whose importance wanes with each passing day. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Roose</strong>: You noticed, still has friends in important places, whom she
  can ask for favours.<br><sub><strong>Season 5: Episode 3</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But he did not trust Petyr Baelish. The only reason he was double-crossing Cersei was because he didn't trust her either. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Roose Bolton</strong>: ""I have something important to tell you. Stop eating and
  listen. We don't have enough men to hold the North if the other Houses
  rise up against us, do you understand that?""</p>
  
  <p><strong>Ramsay Bolton</strong>: ""But our pact with the Lannisters protects us
  from.....""</p>
  
  <p><strong>Roose Bolton</strong>: ""I had a pact with Tywin Lannister, and Tywin Lannister
  is dead. The remaining Lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing
  with that fact. They've never once in the history of the Seven
  Kingdoms sent their army this far North. If you think they will for
  us, you're a fool. We've become a Great House by entering into
  alliances with other houses, and piling those alliances into greater
  power. The best way to forge a lasting alliance isn't by peeling a
  man's skin off. The best way is marriage, and now that you're a Bolton
  by royal decree, it's high time you married a suitable bride, and as
  it happens, I've found the perfect girl to solidify our hold on the
  North.""<br><sub><strong>Season 5: Episode 3</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Roose</strong>: A message for you, from Cersei Lannister. A rider arrived from Eyrie,
  shortly before dawn. Apparently, she thinks you're still in the Vale. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Baelish</strong>: A message for me, you say. Strange that the seal is broken. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Roose</strong>: I'm sure you understand my position, Lord Baelish. If you received
  word in the night from the Queen Mother, it does make me question our
  new alliance. Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros.
  Yet, here you are in the North, undermining them. Why gamble with your
  position? </p>
  
  <p><strong>Baelish</strong>: Every ambitious move is a gamble. You gambled when you drove a dagger
  into Robb Stark's heart. It appears that your gamble paid off. You're
  Warden of the North. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Roose</strong>: I had Tywin Lannister backing. Who supports me now? You? </p>
  
  <p><strong>Baelish</strong>: The Eyrie is mine. The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an
  alliance with the lords of the North, they brought down the greatest
  dynasty this world has ever known.<br><sub><strong>Season 5: Episode 3</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So In conclusion:</p>

<ol>
<li>the Northmen were not actively resisting the Boltons until Jon came down from the Wall. That doesn't mean however that they were happy with the way things stood. Even then they were afraid as the support from Northern Houses was little to None. Jon had to rely on Wildlings instead.</li>
<li>The North was not in an open rebellion against the Crown when Roose Bolton was the Warden. It is however unclear whether Bolton harbored any ambitions for independence given that while he served the Crown, he also married his heir to daughter of an attainted traitor. But of course he had to do it, to provide legitimacy to Ramsay's children and stabilize Bolton rule over North. Aegon the Conqueror did the same thing, Princess Argella Durrandon was ""awarded"" to Orys Baratheon after her father was killed along with the Durrandon titles and lands. Their Children were seen as heirs of Durrandon Kings and the Baratheon dynasty still flies the sigil of Durrandon Storm Kings and are accepted as their heirs. The Stormlords are fiercely loyal to them.</li>

"179894","Which ancestral weapon is the oldest in The World of Ice and Fire (Planetos)?","<p>Some House's proudly bear their ancestral weapon, usually a Valyrian steel made sword even if there are exceptions such as Dawn. </p>

<p>Which one of these ancestral weapons is claimed to be the oldest?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><weapon>","179895","<p>Since your question is about all ancestral swords, not just the Valyrian steel ones, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dawn"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dawn</a> is oldest ancestral sword in Westeros. It is claimed to have been passed down to the greatest Swordsmen of the House for ten thousand years.</p>

<p>Ser Gerold says this about his house:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There was an Arthur Dayne,” Myrcella said. “He was a knight of the
  Kingsguard in the days of Mad King Aerys.”</p>
  
  <p>“He was the Sword of the Morning. He is dead.”</p>
  
  <p>“Are you the Sword of the Morning now?”</p>
  
  <p>“No. Men call me Darkstar, and I am of the night.”</p>
  
  <p>Arianne drew the child away. “You must be hungry. We have dates and
  cheese and olives, and lemonsweet to drink. You ought not eat or drink
  too much, though. After a little rest, we must ride. Out here on the
  sands it is always best to travel by night, before the sun ascends the
  sky. It is kinder to the horses.”</p>
  
  <p>“And the riders,” Spotted Sylva said. “Come, Your Grace, warm
  yourself. I should be honored if you’d let me serve you.”</p>
  
  <p>As she led the princess to the fire, Arianne found Ser Gerold behind
  her. “<strong>My House goes back ten thousand years, unto the dawn of days</strong>,”
  he complained. “Why is it that my cousin is the only Dayne that anyone
  remembers?”<br><sub><strong>AFFC -  The Queen Maker</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The founder of House Dayne, according to the legend, tracked a star to the mouth of Torentine river and constructed a castle, Starfall, where the fallen star was discovered. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the mouth of the Torrentine, House Dayne raised its castle on an
  island where that roaring, tumultuous river broadens to meet the sea.
  <strong>Legend says the first Dayne was led to the site when he followed the track of a falling star and there found a stone of magical powers.</strong>
  His descendants ruled over the western mountains for centuries
  thereafter as Kings of the Torrentine and Lords of Starfall.<br><sub><strong>TWOIAF: Dorne- Kingdoms of the First Men</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The sword was forged most likely from <em>the heart</em> of this star. So by that assumption, if the founder of House Dayne forged the sword and the House has been around for 10,000 years, the sword is just as old.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Something his father had told him once when he was little came back to
  him suddenly. He had asked Lord Eddard if the Kingsguard were truly
  the finest knights in the Seven Kingdoms. “No longer,” he answered,
  “but once they were a marvel, a shining lesson to the world.”</p>
  
  <p>“Was there one who was best of all?”</p>
  
  <p>“<strong>The finest knight I ever saw was Ser Arthur Dayne, who fought with
  a blade called Dawn, forged from the heart of a fallen star.</strong> They
  called him the Sword of the Morning, and he would have killed me but
  for Howland Reed.” Father had gotten sad then, and he would say no
  more. Bran wished he had asked him what he meant.<br><sub><strong>ACOK- Bran III</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In any case, TWOIAF confirms that it is likely that the sword has been in the family for several thousand years. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Daynes of Starfall are one of the most ancient houses in the Seven
  Kingdoms, though their fame largely rests on their ancestral sword,
  called Dawn, and the men who wielded it. <strong>Its origins are lost to
  legend, but it seems likely that the Daynes have carried it for
  thousands of years.</strong> Those who have had the honor of examining it say
  it looks like no Valyrian steel they know, being pale as milkglass but
  in all other respects it seems to share the properties of Valyrian
  blades, being incredibly strong and sharp.<br><sub><strong>TWOIAF: Dorne- The Andals arrive</strong></sub></p>

<p>The <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Currency"" rel=""noreferrer"">Game of Thrones Wikia</a> seems to confirm this, but does not supply a source.</p>
<p>But it still strikes me as odd, mainly because the rest of the currency that I remember reading in the book is referred to very precisely. I remember copper pennies (also called stars), silver stags (House Baratheon's mint I presume) and golden dragons. Groat is the only denomination to turn up first in a figure of speech, rather than a form of payment. The only other denomination to take on such a figure (at this point in the books) is the dwarf's penny which</p>

</blockquote>
<p>And this expression is introduced and very clearly defined through dialog.</p>
<p>So my question is if a groat has a more proper introduction and definition in the Game of Thrones books or if it just slips into existence (in a typical High-Fantasy fashion) as an anachronism of olde/middle English? A book &amp; page reference with quote would be fantastic.</p>

"46551","What's the story behind Rhaegar Targeryan and Lyanna Stark?","<p>What is the story behind Rhaegar and Lyanna?</p>

<p>I remember reading in one of the books that Rhaegar won the tourney at Harrenhal and named Lyanna Stark the Queen of Love and Beauty. And there's also a mention elsewhere where Robert Baratheon says ""if Rhaegar hadn't laid eyes on Lyanna, she would have been alive"".</p>

<p>Was Rhaegar responsible for Lyanna's death/suffering directly or indirectly?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><fan-theory>","46571","<p>Clues about Rhaegar and Lyanna, together, or by themselves:</p>

<p>Rhaegar is (presumably) mentioned in Daenerys' perspective, in the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_of_the_Undying""><em>House of the Undying prophecies</em></a> (also <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/Prophecies/Entry/1813"">here</a>) like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Rubies flew like drops of blood from the chest of a dying prince, and he sank to his knees in the water and with his last breath murmured a woman's name.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Presumably this woman is Lyanna. Also noted in the prophecies is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>A blue flower grew from a chink in a wall of ice, and filled the air with sweetness.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which may be a reference to Jon (at the Wall), the presumed love child of Lyanna (blue roses) and Rhaegar (link to Daenerys).</p>

<p>And of course, Daenerys sees Rhaegar as one of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_of_the_Undying#Visions_in_the_House_of_the_Undying"">the visions</a> in one of the rooms in the House of the Undying:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The man had her brother’s hair, but he was taller, and his eyes were a
  dark indigo rather than lilac. <em>""Aegon,""</em> he said to a woman nursing a
  newborn babe in a great wooden bed. <em>""What better name for a king?""</em></p>
  
  <p><em>""Will you make a song for him?""</em> the woman asked.</p>
  
  <p><em>""He has a song,""</em> the man replied. <em>""He is the prince that was promised,
  and his is the song of ice and fire.""</em> He looked up when he said it and
  his eyes met Dany, and it seemed as if he saw her standing there
  beyond the door. <em>""There must be one more,""</em> he said, though whether he
  was speaking to her or the woman in bed she could not say. <em>""The dragon
  has three heads.""</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The woman would be his wife, Elia of Dorne. Presumably, the ""third head"" he is talking about is Lyanna.</p>

<p>The prohecy Rhaegar is referring to there is the one foretold about <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/The_prince_that_was_promised""><em>the Prince that was Promised</em></a>, which was retold to Rhaegar's great grandfather <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon_V_Targaryen"">Aegon V Targaryen</a> (aka Egg from the Dunk &amp; Egg novels) by the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ghost_of_High_Heart"">Ghost of High Heart</a> (the little dwarf ghost lady that Arya meets when she travels with Lord Beric's gang). She foretold that The Prince that was Promised should come from the line of the mad king Aerys II, which is something that Rhaegar took to heart. Aegon V's daughter is also coincidentally Robert Baratheon's grandmother.</p>

<p>The propecy of the Ghost of High Heart eventually lead to the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tragedy_of_Summerhall"">Tragedy at Summerhall</a>, the Targaryen summer residence which was the seat of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Maekar_I_Targaryen"">Maekar</a>, the father of Aegon V (Egg). The tragedy was presumably the result of an experiment to hatch dragons by Aegon V. Prince Rhaegar was born on the day of that tragedy, and may be the ""dragon"" that was hatched. Rhaegar was often preoccupied with this tragedy, spending time alone in Summerhall and writing sad songs.</p>

<p>In <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Knight_of_the_Laughing_Tree"">the story of the Knight of the Laughing Tree</a>, we see Rhaegar at the tournament at Harrenhal, where he crowns Lyanna the Queen of love and beauty. A theory about this event is that Lyanna is the mystery knight, and that Rhaegar unmasked her, therefore thinking of her as a great warrior maiden (which she by accounts was). Which may be why he crowned her, and why he felt she would be a suitable ""third head"" in his prophecies.</p>

<p>All in all, Rhaegar was a melancholy man that was preoccupied with prophecies. It does not seem likely that he would abduct and rape a woman, like Robert claimed. </p>

<p>Also, of course, we have the promise that Ned Stark made to Lyanna (<em>Promise me, Ned</em> -- AGOT), when she was in her death bed. What could it possibly have been, that Ned would obsess over it during his time in King's Landing and in the dungeons? A good guess would be something to keep secret from Robert, because Robert swore to ""kill all the dragonspawn [he] could get [his] hands on"", such as a son of Rhaegar: Jon.</p>

"180141","Do spring and autumn last as long as summer and winter?","<p>Westeros's climates is ruled by random-length winter and summer. It is said that summer and winter's lengths are correlated: the longer the summer, the longer the winter. But what about spring and autumn? Do spring and autumn last as long as summer and winter?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","180142","<p><strong>TLDR:</strong>
There are at least two notable examples of long summer followed by a much shorter autumn.</p>

<p><strong>Long answer:</strong></p>

<p>As stated before, there are at least two notable examples of long summer followed by a much shorter autumn:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The summer during the reign of Maekar was quite long (seven years), and so the winter (unknow length but hardly suggested to be quite long). However, the autumn was short.</p>

<p>A Game of Thrones - Eddard V</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The heavy jeweled chain around the old man's neck chinked softly as he shifted in his seat. ""To be sure, King Maekar's summer was hotter than this one, and near as long. There were fools, even in the Citadel, who took that to mean that the Great Summer had come at last, the summer that never ends, but in the seventh year it broke suddenly, and we had a short autumn and a terrible long winter"".</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>The current events: At the beginning of the story(around 298 AC), we are on a long summer. The summer ends in 299AC,in the prologue of ACOK, after ten years, two turns(month), and sixteen days. The winter comes in 300AC, during the epilogue of ADWD. Even if we don't know the exact time lapse between the two, it is much more shorter than the summer.</p>

<p>A Clash of Kings - Prologue</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shireen gave a brave little nod. ""Mother said the white raven means it's not summer anymore.""
  ""That is so, my lady. The white ravens fly only from the Citadel."" Cressen's fingers went to the chain about his neck, each link forged from a different metal, each symbolizing his mastery of another branch of learning; the maester's collar, mark of his order. In the pride of his youth, he had worn it easily, but now it seemed heavy to him, the metal cold against his skin. ""They are larger than other ravens, and more clever, bred to carry only the most important messages. This one came to tell us that the Conclave has met, considered the reports and measurements made by maesters all over the realm, and declared this great summer done at last. Ten years, two turns, and sixteen days it lasted, the longest summer in living memory.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A Dance with Dragons - Epilogue</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Not silver. White. The bird is white.
  The white ravens of the Citadel did not carry messages, as their dark cousins did. When they went forth from Oldtown, it was for one purpose only: to herald a change of seasons.
  ""Winter,"" said Ser Kevan. The word made a white mist in the air. He turned away from the window.</p>

"180248","Are there any real-life parallels to the Night's Watch and their fall from prestige?","<p>In <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> (and also in the series <em>Game of Thrones</em>), the Night's Watch is a peculiar institution: Regardless of its <em>actual</em> usefulness, it serves a supposedly ""vital"" function which was originally considered an honorable endeavor by all cultures which partook in the tradition. In other words, the Night's Watch was considered a vital and beneficial institution, and joining the watch was considered a very honorable thing to do. Over time, however, the practical function of the Night's Watch changed from ""guarding the realms of men"" to being a last resort for criminals, the disinherited and the disgraced. Over time, it gained a stigma among most people, but this stigma failed to gain much traction in one place &mdash; namely, <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/179594/65294"">in the North</a>. Likewise, although the Watch is pretty much considered by Southerners to serve <em>only</em> as an alternative to death and/or (even greater) disgrace, it seems that some Northerners still willingly join (such as <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/ConQuest_Kansas_City_MO_May_27_294"" rel=""noreferrer"">Benjen Stark</a> did).</p>

<p>Visualizing the practical function of the Night's Watch for respective regions compared to their perception of the Night's Watch in a table suggests that the perception of the Night's Watch is correlated with the function of it over time: As all the non-Northern kingdoms used the Watch for ever less-reputable reasons, it begins to be perceived as less reputable as well... but this trend doesn't hold with Northern culture(s) as far as the books seem to portray it/them (albeit that nearly all information provided is from the point of view of noblemen rather than the common folk):</p>

<pre><code>        | The North                           | Elsewhere                   |
        |-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
Era     | Function               | Perception | Function     | Perception   |
--------| -----------------------|------------|--------------|--------------| 
Earlier | Reputable              | Reputable  | Reputable    | Reputable    |
Later   | Reputable/disreputable | Reputable  | Disreputable | Disreputable |
</code></pre>

<p>It strikes me as very much... fantasy that such a well-established tradition can exist and ""degrade"" so much and yet be ""tolerated"" for so long while one significant group remains an ""outlier"" in still valuing it. However, <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/143522/65294"">G.R.R. Martin takes liberal inspiration from history</a>, so it may be possible that the Night's Watch was inspired by some parts of real-world history... knowingly or otherwise. So, <strong>are/were there any real-life institutions/orders/traditions which originally served a highly-respected function to everyone but became stigmatized over time to everyone except for a certain subculture and yet continued to exist for a long time<sup>&dagger;</sup>?</strong></p>

<p>The only (very weak) parallel I can think of is that of monastic orders such as the Benedictines, but it doesn't fit very well because they're not <em>stigmatized</em> but simply entail a career path and lifestyle that not many aspire to following these days. Is there <em>any</em> institution in real-world history which has gone from holding an esteemed function in society to being heavily stigmatized and its function degraded... and yet continued to exist for so long? </p>

<p><sup>&dagger;</sup>Since everything in <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> seems to last for ridiculously long periods of time, the scope of what constitutes a ""long time"" would of course have to be adjusted for the real world.</p>

"180469","Is there a legal age for drinking wine in Westeros?","<p>In <em>Game of Thrones</em> S07 E01 ""Dragonstone"", there is a scene where Arya Stark meets a group of Lannister soldiers.

<blockquote>
  <p>Are you old enough to drink? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This made me think whether there is a legal age to drink wine or ale in Westeros. In Winterfell, there is a hint regarding this because Sansa Stark says in the earlier seasons to Joffrey that her father didn't allow more than two cups of wine. </p>

<p>So, is there a legal age to drink wine in Westeros or is it a bad writing?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><age>","180470","<p><strong>Unlikely any official age.</strong></p>

<p>The common theory is that during medieval times water sources were not particularly clean and therefore beer, wine, and mead were common beverages during meal times. </p>

<p>However, they were not like the alcoholic beverages of today. Typically children were served what is known as a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_beer"" rel=""noreferrer"">small beer</a> which has a lower alcohol content than normal beers such as ale. The same is true of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mead"" rel=""noreferrer"">mead</a>, which had widely varying degrees of alcohol by volume (ABV) but was easily watered down. It is even possible that the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wort"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wort</a> (the mixture of sugar before fermenting) might have been used as a beverage which while still sanitary had no alcohol.</p>

<p>Although, children would obviously be more susceptible to getting drunk on even smaller amounts of alcohol and parents would have to regulate how much their children consumed. This well explains Sansa's quote about being allowed only one or two cups while she was still in the 12-14 age range. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They dined on trout fresh from the river, and Sansa <strong>drank more wine than she had ever drunk before.</strong> ""My father only lets us have one cup, and only at feasts,"" she confessed to her prince.
  ""My betrothed can drink as much as she wants,"" Joffrey said, refilling her cup.</p>
  
  <p>They went more slowly after they had eaten. Joffrey sang for her as they rode, his voice high and sweet and pure. <strong>Sansa was a little dizzy from the wine.</strong> </p>
  
  <p><em>A Game of Thrones - Sansa I</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Arya is allowed to have beer in small quantities even at age 9.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Her father sometimes let them have a cup of beer, she remembered. Sansa used to make a face at the taste and say that wine was ever so much finer, but Arya had liked it well enough.</p>
  
  <p><em>A Clash of Kings - Arya II</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would take the solider asking Arya about if she old enough to drink, not as bad writing but perhaps as, ""Are you old enough to handle the alcohol."", much like she was by a common-folk;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Sharna's husband, and an orphan boy they took in. They won't harm you. <strong>There's ale, if you think you're old enough.</strong> Fresh bread and maybe a bit of meat."" Tom glanced toward the cottage. ""And whatever you stole from Old Pate's garden besides.""</p>

"180824","How much creative independence are the Show runners accorded in Game of Thrones?","<p>Since Season 3, we have been observing that the show was taking a different direction than the books. Many important characters never made it into the show, others who are still alive were killed off. </p>

<p>As we know the show is supposed to be based on the books, not to be direct adaption of the books from print to television media, there's bound to be a certain degree of creative independence accorded to them by the author of the series, George R.R. Martin. </p>

<p>The question is, how much independence do they have? Do they still have to take GRRM on board with whatever changes they might intend to make? By ""they"" I mean D&amp;D and the whole writers crew for the show. Given the number of significant changes they have made, I reckon the answer would be a lot. Has GRRM or HBO ever commented on that?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> <strong>How independent are the showrunners from you?</strong> Simply put: could they save the life of a character you’ve decided to kill? Or
  could they kill someone who’s still alive in your books?</p>
  
  <p><strong>GRRM:</strong> <strong>They are independent. They can do whatever they want. I don’t have any power… any contractual right to [stop them]. I consult
  with them. I talk to them on a regular basis. Of course, years ago, we
  had a series of very long meetings, where I told them some of the big
  twists and turns and huge events that were coming in the last few
  books. So they’ve been touching [on] some of these, and doing some of
  the reveals, but they have also been departing in various ways.</strong></p>
  
  <p>The biggest one is one that you just mentioned: probably right now,
  right as we talk, there are close to 20 characters who are dead on the
  show, who are still alive in the books. Some of them are very minor
  characters, but also there are major characters, like Rickon Stark,
  Barristan Selmy, Myrcella Baratheon. All of them — dead on the show,
  but alive in the books.</p>
  
  <p>There are also a number of characters in the books — fairly important
  characters — who have never been in the show at all. Characters who
  were omitted totally. It’s not a question of killing them; they’re
  just not there. They were never a part of it: Lady Stoneheart is one
  of them; Arianne Martell, the heir to Dorne, who’s a viewpoint
  character; and Victarion Greyjoy, one of the sons of Quellon Greyjoy
  and brother to Balon and Euron. All of these characters are quite
  important in the books and missing totally in the show.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Q:</strong> How has your involvement in the show changed over time?</p>
  
  <p><strong>GRRM:</strong> I’m a co-executive producer on the show; David and Dan are the showrunners. Right from the first, <strong>we knew that they were going
  to do the lion’s share of the work</strong>, but I did wanted to be involved.
  I<strong>nitially, I was involved in all the casting</strong> — I wasn’t physically
  present — I was here in Santa Fe. But through the wonders of the
  internet, I was able to look at all of the actors reading and to write
  them long letters and to have phone calls where I discussed which
  actors I like and which actors I didn’t like. <strong>And in the early
  seasons, I wrote one script per season.</strong> I would have gladly done
  more, but there just wasn’t time. I’m still trying to do these books.
  <strong>It takes me about a month to write a script and I didn’t have a month to spare, so I said, I think I’ll sit out season 5. I’ve sat out
  seasons 6 and 7 too</strong>, just trying to concentrate on this book, which
  as you know is massively late. So in that sense, <strong>my involvement in
  the show has diminished over time</strong>, though, I’m still here whenever
  they want to talk to me, and I’m always glad to weigh in. David and
  Dan have come to Santa Fe and we’ve discussed many of the ultimate
  developments, those landmarks that I spoke to at the end of the road
  that we’re both driving for. <strong>So I don’t need to be quite as involved
  as I was at the beginning.</strong></p>

"181009","Does it matter what religion a king follows?","<p>King Robert Baratheon and several Targaryen Kings before him adhered to the Faith of the Seven. </p>

<p>The crown/throne and the High Septon are on really good terms with each other and most people of the Seven Kingdoms are followers of the Faith of the Seven, Except for the Northmen who believe in the Old gods and the Ironborn who believe in the Drowned God.</p>

<p>What would happen if someone (like Stannis Baratheon), who doesn't follow the Seven, the Old gods or the Drowned god, were to (or try to) become the new King of Westeros?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","181073","<p>Other than what TLC has covered, religion is a sensitive issue in Westeros. </p>

<p>Majority of the people in Westeros adhere to the Faith and followers of other religions are in minority, specifically limited to the North and Iron Islands disregarding small exceptions like Blackwoods in Riverlands and Manderleys in the North. Ever since Aegon took the throne and converted to the Faith, it has been generally accepted that the King must be from the majority religion i.e. the Faith. It is implied due to the fact that Northmen and Ironborn kept their vows for most of the times. That can be attributed to the internal autonomy of the both regions, neither of them answer to anyone other than the King and are free to rule themselves as they wish as long as they keep faith with the Crown and do not break the King's laws. These responsibilities lie on shoulders of the Lords Paramounts of both regions. </p>

<p>But that does not mean that People in Westeros do not generally care about the religion. </p>

<p>When King Aenys I tried to marry his daughter to his son, he was denounced as ""King abomination"" by the High Septon and was soon fighting a rebellion. This Valyrian tradition was not welcome at all in the faith of the Seven.  Lords and Commons alike took sides with thousands rallying to the Sept to protect the Faith. It would end only in the reign of King Jaehaerys I who disbanded the faith militant and vowed that the Crown shall always defend the Holy Mother Sept, a vow all Targaryens kept. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some counselors urged the Old King to deal with the remnants of the
  Faith Militant harshly—to stamp them out once and for all before their
  zealotry could return the realm to chaos. Others cared more for
  ensuring that the septons were answerable to the same justice as the
  rest of the realm. But Jaehaerys instead dispatched Septon Barth to
  Oldtown, to speak with the High Septon, and there they began to forge
  a lasting agreement. <strong>In return for the last few Stars and Swords
  putting down their weapons, and for agreeing to accept outside
  justice, the High Septon received King Jaehaerys's sworn oath that the
  Iron Throne would always protect and defend the Faith</strong>. In this way,
  the great schism between crown and Faith was forever healed.<br><sub><strong>TWOIAF -Targaryen Kings : Jaehaerys I</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So while the Faith is happy to be peaceful as long as a follower of the Faith, in this case the King, guarantees to always defend the Faith against religious threats, why should they believe vows of a non-believer to be genuine? If someone who kept other gods than the Seven took the throne, that would force the Sept to reconsider their arrangement with the Crown naturally. How long before the heathen outlaws their one true faith eh? Or persecutes them? Or forces people to convert to their superstition?</p>

<p>The religious minorities were forced to tolerate the Faith once Aegon converted and took the throne, given the Targaryen power. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And <strong>since Aegon had accepted the Seven as his gods and been anointed
  by the High Septon in Oldtown, Lord Vickon allowed the septons to
  return to the islands once again to preach the Faith</strong>.</p>
  
  <p><strong>This angered many pious ironborn and provoked the wroth of the priests of the Drowned God, as it always had before</strong>. ""Let them
  preach,"" Lord Vickon said, when told of the unrest. ""We have need of
  winds to fill our sails."" He was Aegon's man, he reminded his son
  Goren, and no man but a fool would dare rise against Aegon Targaryen
  and his dragons.<br><sub><strong>TWOIAF -The Iron Islands : The Greyjoys of Pyke</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>They let them preach because as long as the Throne did not force the conversion, there was no reason to risk a confrontation with the Crown. But Goren got rid of the Faith soon.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These were words that Goren Greyjoy would remember. When Lord Vickon
  died in 33 AC, Goren succeeded him as Lord of the Iron Islands,
  putting down a clumsy conspiracy to restore the black line by crowning
  Qhorin Volmark's son in his stead. He faced a more serious test four
  years later, when Aegon the Conqueror died of a stroke on Dragonstone,
  and his son Aenys was crowned king in his stead. Though amiable and
  well-meaning, Aenys Targaryen was widely perceived as a weakling,
  unfit to sit the Iron Throne. The new king was still on his royal
  progress when rebellions began to break out all across the realm. One
  such revolt convulsed the Iron Islands, led by a man claiming that he
  was the priestking Lodos returned at last from visiting his father. </p>
  
  <p>But Goren Greyjoy dealt with it decisively, going so far as to send
  the priestking's pickled head to Aenys Targaryen. <strong>His Grace was so
  pleased with the gift that he promised Lord Goren any boon that was
  within his power to grant</strong>. As sage as he was savage, <strong>Greyjoy asked
  the king to give him leave to expel the septons and septas from the
  Iron Islands</strong>. King Aenys was forced to agree. A century would pass
  before another sept was opened on the islands.<br><sub><strong>TWOIAF -The Iron Islands : The Greyjoys of Pyke</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the Septons did return, that shows that the minorities, while willing to accept the Crown's authority, were not okay with influence of the other religions on them. If minorities feel that way, Majority would feel that as well and more strongly if follower of some other faith was to rule them. </p>

<p>Lannisters used exactly that against Stannis when he took the faith of the Red Priests.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tyrion made a show of glancing over the writing again. There had been
  some niggling phrase . . . ""Done in the Light of the Lord,"" he read.
  ""A queer choice of words, that.""</p>
  
  <p>Pycelle cleared his throat. ""These words often appear in letters and
  documents from the Free Cities. They mean no more than, let us say,
  written in the sight of god. The god of the red priests. It is their
  usage, I do believe.""</p>
  
  <p>""Varys told us some years past that Lady Selyse had taken up with a
  red priest,"" Littlefinger reminded them.</p>
  
  <p>Tyrion tapped the paper. ""And now it would seem her lord husband has
  done the same. We can use that against him. <strong>Urge the High Septon to
  reveal how Stannis has turned against the gods as well as his rightful
  king</strong> . . .""<br><sub><strong>ACOK - Tyrion III</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since the High Septon is considered to be voice of the gods on Earth by the majority, his words will carry great weight. </p>

<p>Cersei tried to use the same support for Tommen:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Most have lost their homes. Suffering is everywhere... and grief, and
  death. Before coming to King’s Landing, I tended to half a hundred
  little villages too small to have a septon of their own. I walked from
  each one to the next, performing marriages, absolving sinners of their
  sins, naming newborn children. Those villages are no more, Your Grace.
  Weeds and thorns grow where gardens once flourished, and bones litter
  the roadsides.”</p>
  
  <p>“War is a dreadful thing. <strong>These atrocities are the work of the
  northmen, and of Lord Stannis and his demon-worshipers</strong>.”</p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <p>“<strong>The realm is full of kings</strong>. For the Faith to exalt one above the
  rest we must be certain. Three hundred years ago, when Aegon the
  Dragon landed beneath this very hill, the High Septon locked himself
  within the Starry Sept of Oldtown and prayed for seven days and seven
  nights, taking no nourishment but bread and water. When he emerged he
  announced that the Faith would not oppose Aegon and his sisters, for
  the Crone had lifted up her lamp to show him what lay ahead. If
  Oldtown took up arms against the Dragon, Oldtown would burn, and the
  Hightower and the Citadel and the Starry Sept would be cast down and
  destroyed. Lord Hightower was a godly man. When he heard the prophecy,
  he kept his strength at home and opened the city gates to Aegon when
  he came. And His High Holiness anointed the Conqueror with the seven
  oils. I must do as he did, three hundred years ago. I must pray, and
  fast.”</p>
  
  <p>“For seven days and seven nights?”</p>
  
  <p>“For as long as need be.”</p>
  
  <p>Cersei itched to slap his solemn, pious face. I could help you fast,
  she thought. I could shut you up in some tower and see that no one
  brings you food until the gods have spoken. “<strong>These false kings
  espouse false gods,</strong>” she reminded him. “<strong>Only King Tommen defends
  the Holy Faith.</strong>”<br><sub><strong>AFFC - Cersei VI</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But Zealotry is a two-way street. Luckily, most of the Kings, even Aerys II, had the wisdom to tread carefully in the matters of faith and did not vex the religious minorities in the North and Iron Isles. Baelor the Blessed was however not that wise and in his reign, the relations were set to be soured between the Crown and the minorities due to his zealotry. Thanks to the alleged intervention of his uncle Viserys, the King could not begin his project to force conversion of all his subjects and the Targaryen dynasty did not face a revolt in the North and the West.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Malicious rumors that followed in the wake of Viserys's
  ascension—begun, some say, by the pen of the Lady Maia of House
  Stokeworth—suggested that Viserys poisoned the king in order to
  finally gain the throne after a decade and more of waiting. Others
  have suggested that <strong>Viserys poisoned Baelor for the good of the
  realm, since the septon-king had come to believe that the Seven called
  on him to convert all the unbelievers in his realm. This would have
  led to a war with the North and the Iron Islands that would have
  caused great turmoil</strong>.<br><sub><strong>TWOIAF -Targaryen Kings : Baelor I</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in conclusion, yes it definitely matters which religion does the King follow. The King is the defender of Holy Mother Sept and therefore cannot espouse any other religion if he is to be seen that way. Furthermore, given the demographics of the realm, it is imperative that the King must have the same religion as the majority of the People. That being said, it is also equally important for the King to refrain from antagonizing the powerful minorities in the West and North and act like a symbol of unity for all the Westerosi people, regardless to their faith. </p>

","<game-of-thrones>","47777","<p>Although swordplay is sometimes referred to as dancing, the term was also deliberately used to deceive others as to the nature of Arya's training.</p>

  <p>""Lyanna might have carried a sword, if my lord father had allowed it""</p>

Mad Danelle Lothston herself rode forth in strength from her haunted towers at Harrenhal, clad in black armor that fit her like an iron glove, her long red hair streaming. The light of the rising sun glittered off the points of five hundred lances and ten times as many spears. The night's grey banners were reborn in half a hundred gaudy colors. And above them all flew two regal dragons on night-black fields: the great three-headed beast of King Aerys I Targaryen, red as fire, and a white winged fury breathing scarlet flame. Not Maekar after all, Dunk knew, when he saw those banners. The banners of the Prince of Summerhall showed four three-headed dragons, two and two, the arms of the fourth-born son of the late King Daeron II Targaryen.

  It was white weirwood, and there was a face on it.
  A glow came from the wood, like milk and moonlight, so faint it scarcely seemed to touch anything beyond the door itself, not even Sam standing right before it.

She found twigs and fallen branches beneath the snow and broke off the ends to make the trees for the godswood. <strong>For the gravestones in the lichyard she used bits of bark.</strong> Soon her gloves and her boots were crusty white, her hands were tingling, and her feet were soaked and cold, but she did not care. The castle was all that mattered. Some things were hard to remember, but most came back to her easily, as if she had been there only yesterday.

They consorted with giants and ghouls, stole girl children in the dead of night, and drank blood from polished horns. And their women lay with the Others in the Long Night to sire terrible half-human children.<br>
  But the man they found bound hand and foot to the holdfast wall awaiting the king's justice was old and scrawny, not much taller than Robb.

<p>we cannot know whether Sansa would have had the warg dreams like Arya, Bran and Jon Snow. Are we meant to infer that <em>all</em> of the Stark children are wargs (or have the potential to be so) or is this exclusive to Arya, Bran and Jon.</p>

<p>We never get a chapter from the point of view of Robb or Rickon, but throughout the book there is common mention of how dissimilar Sansa and Arya are and how alike Arya and Jon are. I am wondering if this is due to the Stark (as opposed to the Tully) blood. We are constantly reminded of how similar Sansa is to her mother - at least in terms of appearance.</p>

<p>Are we meant to infer that it is the Stark genes that are responsible for this or is this an over simplification?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","48178","<p>When I read the title of this question, my first and foremost thought was: Does it matter? In the grand scheme of things, we shall see what we shall see: Bran is doing his thing, Arya her thing, Sansa her thing, and Jon his thing. What Rickon does, we do not know (yet). </p>

<p>My second thought was, yes, of course it <em>did</em> matter way back when, when I first read the series. </p>

<p>I've had a while to think about this, so perhaps I can review my thoughts.</p>

<p>In <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, the very first book, the very first chapter, the very first few pages, Jon Snow says to Lord Eddard Stark, regarding the direwolf pups found in the snow:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You have five trueborn children,"" Jon said. ""Three sons, two daughters. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then we find out that there is another pup, one that is all white.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""An albino,"" Theon Greyjoy said with wry amusement. ""This one will
  die even faster than the others.""</p>
  
  <p>Jon Snow gave his father's ward a long, chilling look. ""I think not,
  Greyjoy,"" he said. ""This one belongs to me.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is clear from the very start of the book that this is supposed to mean something. I believe the first person to know how special this bond is is Bran, although I cannot safely say what order this happened. But I do remember the moment when Bran woke up after his long coma dreams, scaring a serving woman to death:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When his brother Robb burst into the room, breathless from his dash up the tower steps, the direwolf was licking Bran's face. Bran looked up calmly. ""His name is Summer,"" he said. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We get countless examples of Bran dreaming ""wolf dreams"", which makes it redundant to elaborate on Bran/Summer. We also know that Jon has some intense moments where he and Ghost are connected in some otherworldly way, such as when he sees the huge wildling camp at the Milkwater through Ghost's eyes.</p>

<p>We also know that Arya has vivid dreams of Nymeria, such as when Nymeria swims out into the river and drags Catelyn Stark's body to the shore, and the next morning, Arya knows her mother is dead.</p>

<p>We also see Arya in Braavos, seeing through the eyes of a cat when <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Kindly_Man"">the kindly old man</a> is playing tricks on her, and know that she still is having wolf dreams.</p>

<p>Sansa is the only one who never has any wolf dreams, or visions through <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lady_%28direwolf%29"">her direwolf Lady</a>. We do know that Lady, like all the other direwolves, reflected her owners personality in her own: She was well-behaved and ladylike. She was killed rather early on, through Sansa's own cowardice, so we do not know much of that. We do know, however, that Sansa tamed another large and dangerous canine: <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/The_Hound"">Sandor ""The Hound"" Clegane</a>. Read the chapters, I am sure you will see what I am talking about.</p>

<p>Then there is Robb. The forlorn lord, who lost the north. We do not know what goes on in Robb's mind. But we do know that the extra sensory perception that was evident in all the wolves: The ability to sense evil or betrayal in people, the ability to sense danger, or grief, was also present in <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Grey_Wind"">Grey Wind</a>. But Robb pushed aside his intuition and his trust in Grey Wind, when the untrue rumour of his brothers' demise reached him.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Catelyn] ""Any man Grey Wind mislikes is a man I do not want close to you.
  These wolves are more than wolves, Robb. You must know that. I think
  perhaps the gods sent them to us. Your father's gods, the old gods of
  the north. Five wolf pups, Robb, five for five Stark children.""</p>
  
  <p>""Six,"" said Robb. ""There was a wolf for Jon as well. I found them,
  remember? I know how many there were and where they came from. I used
  to think the same as you, that the wolves were our guardians, our
  protectors, until . . . ""</p>
  
  <p>""Until?"" she prompted.</p>
  
  <p>Robb's mouth tightened. "" . . . Until they told me that Theon had
  murdered Bran and Rickon. Small good their wolves did them. I am no
  longer a boy, Mother. I'm a king, and I can protect myself."" He
  sighed. ""I will find some duty for Ser Rolph, some pretext to send him
  away. Not because of his smell, but to ease your mind. You have
  suffered enough.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Robb chooses not to believe. He is a King, and he lacks the confidence to believe in supernatural things. Despite Grey Wind being almost a part of him at this time, fighting beside him in battles, he allows <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Westerling"">the Westerlings</a> and <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Frey"">the Freys</a> to get between him and his wolf. When he should have trusted his wolf, he does not, and suffers for it. An event that is also shadowed in the events surrounding Jon in ADWD.</p>

<p>Last but not least is Rickon and Shaggydog. It is clear to me that Shaggydog is very much in touch with Rickon's feelings. Rickon is the ""wild wolf"" in the family, and spending all this time with Osha and the wildlings (and unicorns!), the next time we see him, it is sure to be a lively event. The most remarkable event in this context is, I think, in Bran's POV, when Bran convinces Maester Luwin to take him down into the crypts to see if Lord Eddard is, in fact, down there. And instead they find Rickon and Shaggydog, and it turns out Rickon had the same dreams as Bran.</p>

  <p>""Shaggy,"" a small voice called. When Bran looked up, his little
  brother was standing in the mouth of Father's tomb. With one final
  snap at Summer's face, Shaggydog broke off and bounded to Rickon's
  side. ""You let my father be,"" Rickon warned Luwin. ""You let him be.""</p>
  
  <p>""Rickon,"" Bran said softly. ""Father's not here.""</p>
  
  <p>""Yes he is. I saw him."" Tears glistened on Rickon's face. ""I saw him
  last night.""</p>
  
  <p>""In your dream . . . ?""</p>
  
  <p>Rickon nodded. ""You leave him. You leave him be. He's coming home now,
  like he promised. He's coming home.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I would say, yes, all of the Stark children have some of the ""wolf blood"" in them. Bran the most, and Sansa the least. But Jon and Arya have strong experiences as well, and while we do not know the inner thoughts of Robb or Rickon, they do seem to share the same kind of bond with their wolves.</p>

They were in the weirwood, hundreds of them, thousands, perched on the bone-white branches, peering between the leaves. He saw their beaks open as they screamed, saw them spread their black wings. Shrieking, flapping, they descended on the wights in angry clouds.

"114440","What exists beyond Westeros, North of the Wall and the Free Cities?","<p>I went throught the five books and the TV series and just out of curiosity I wanted to ask if there has been mention by G.

<ul>
<li>What kind of places exist beyond the map?</li>
<li>What kind of people are present beyond the wall?</li>
<li>Has there ever been any expedition or contact made by the people (from the places mentioned in the book) to the outside world?</li>

Here's a low res version of the latest official map. The landmass on the left is Westeros, the much larger land mass on the right is Essos where the free cities are. The Wall is across where the completely white section (&quot;<a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Land_of_Always_Winter"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Lands of Always Winter</a>&quot; and, closer to the Wall, the various lands where the wildlings live) joins the pale white section (The North):</p>

<p>Beyond that, off the top of the map, the only clue I'm aware of is from the same dream of Bran's:</p>

<p>That's everything north of the Wall, which is what the question seemed to be asking for.</p>
<p>There's also plenty of interesting other lands south and east (no mention of anything to the west). The premise is similar to Medieval Europe - people in Westeros are aware of other, exotic, distant lands, and occasionally encounter people from them, but don't know much about them. Check out:</p>
<ul>

Seems to be loosely based on medieval perceptions of China and is highly regarded - wine from here is talked about as a valuable luxury, and in Qarth when Xaro Xhoan Daxos tried to convince Dany to go with him, one of the desirables he promised was a honeymoon tour of Yi Ti on a pleasure barge.</li>

<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Sothoryos"" rel=""noreferrer"">Sothoryos</a>, the continent south of Essos.

If he hadn't named one of them it's likely he hadn't named more than that one too. Though the post is from 2006 it's likely he still hasn't named any of the others.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Dornishmen boast that theirs is the oldest of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. This is true, after a fashion. Unlike the Andals, who came later, the First Men were not seafarers. They came to Westeros not on longships but afoot, over <strong>the land bridge from Essos—the remnants of which exist today only as the Stepstones and the Broken Arm of Dorne.</strong> Walking or riding, the eastern shores of Dorne would inevitably have been where they first set foot upon Westerosi soil.<br>

They are quite an interesting area having once been the land bridge between Westeros and Essos and since then having been involved in a few major events in Planetos history.</p>

<p>One thing I can't seem to work out is what region do they belong too? They were once a part of Westeros and Essos and are close to both depending on which island you are on. They also seem to have potentially been independent at some point but I'm not sure if they still are.</p>

<p>Do we know what region/group controls the Stepstones?</p>

<hr>

<p><sup>I am more interested in asking this from a political perspective but if there's any information from a geographical perspective I welcome that discussion too.</sup></p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","182955","<p>No state entity controls Step stones as of now. I am at work so can't find references right now, will do when I am free.</p>
<h3>Migration Era</h3>
<p>As you noted, Stepstones used to be the land bridge which connected Essos and Westeros. It is the very land bridge which the First Men used during their great Migration. So it stands to reason that along the way, some First Men clans may have chosen to settle right there instead of taking the roads further inside Westeros. We already know that Westeros at that point was devoid of any humans and was populated solely by Giants and Children of the Forest.</p>
<p>With the First Men advancing rapidly and exterminating settlements of the Children, they decided to strike back by breaking the land bridge to stem the flood of new comers using their brand of Water magic. But it was too little and too late. There were already enough First Men inside to wage war and the bridge itself wasn't broken completely, it just turned into a series of isles between the two continents, aptly named as Stepstones.</p>
<h3>Importance of the Isles</h3>
<p>The location of the Isles gave them strategic importance in the Naval &quot;Great Game&quot; of Planetos. The Isles sit right on the sealanes from Narrow Sea to Summer Sea, controlling all the trade flowing from West to East and vice versa. Which is why the Isles changed hands a number of times.</p>
<h3>Valyrian Freehold and her Daughters</h3>
<p>Valyrian Freehold, the first example, didn't show much interest in the Stepstones as they already had a naval base to control the said sealanes in the neighbouring Island of Tyrosh. After the fall of the Freehold, her daughters fought over the possession of the strategic Islands because whoever controlled them, practically controlled the trade flowing from East to West and Vice versa. Given that the Free Cities are mostly merchant cities, it was particularly important for them to gain control of the Islands. Neighboring Myr and Lys clashed a number of times for the Isles and they changed hands rapidly.</p>
<h3>Haaar! There be Pirates!</h3>
<p>Capitalising over exhaustion of the Free Cities due to inter-war and century of blood, Bands of Pirates moved in and established their control on the Isles and started making riches by looting the trading ships.</p>
<p>Of course then Essos was plagued with ambitions of Volantis to become new Valyria and the Essosi were too busy to pay attention to the Isles any more. And the Westerosi mostly stayed out of that part of the world. And then by the end of that era, Westeros was conquered by Aegon the Conqueror.</p>
<h3>Westerosi Campaigns</h3>
<p>Before the conquest, Given the nuance caused by the pirates and due to importance of the Isles, the neighbouring Westerosi realms from Stormlands and Dorne also engaged in warfare over the Isles but like the Free Cities, they too failed to make their gains permanent and Isles once again became hub of Piracy.</p>
<p>After the conquest, As raids continued from the Isles on Westerosi land and shipping, Prince Maegor (Later King Maegor) retaliated by a punitive campaign against the pirates. But he did not annex the Isles into the domain of Iron Throne.</p>
<h3>The Triarchy</h3>
<p>When the Free Cities got done with Volantis, three of them, Lys, Myr and Tyrosh united to form the Triarchy to contain Volantis in future. They looked West and invaded the Isles to end piracy. Westerosi nobles were generally in support of the actions of the Triarchy.</p>
<h3>Kingdom of Stepstones and the Narrow Sea</h3>
<p>Losing all hopes of inheriting the Iron Throne due to birth of three sons and two daughters to his elder brother King Viserys II, Prince Daemon Targaryen, with support of Westerosi Lords now disgruntled by heavy tolls imposed by the Triarchy, invaded the Isles with his band of adventurers, who like him were seeking lands and riches. Daemon crowned himself King of the Stepstones and the Narrow Sea. But now Dorne got involved because they were absolutely not going to let the Targaryens forge another Kingdom right across their shores. The tables turned when Dorne and Triarchy joined forces. Daemon, sensing the inevitable doom of his Kingdom while there were interesting prospects rising in Westeros which culminated into Dance of the Dragons, abandoned his Kingdom. But the Kingdom lived on with his followers taking the place. Five men ruled in that capacity until Dorne and Triarchy completely obliterated the Kingdom.</p>
<p>When Triarchy collapsed, another pirate claimed the title of King of the Stepstones during reign of Aegon III after the Dance of the Dragons.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>But eventually, the Kingdom collapsed once again with Pirate Lords ruling their own independent Islands. This state continues to this day however in light of the recent events, there are reports that another man has claimed the title of the King of the Step Stones. Rumors are that he might be the fugitive Admiral Aurane Waters who deserted King Tommen's navy with his newly made dromonds.</p>
<p>So in conclusion:</p>
<ol>
<li>No region has any de-jure claim on the Islands as of now except perhaps Lys and Myr but they are not interested in pressing their claims any longer.</li>
<li>The Isles are independent.</li>
<li>The population of the Isles seems to be a mix of Rhoynar (Different from their Dornish Kins as they did not join Nymeria on her way to Dorne), Westerosi and Essosi settlers, mainly pirates.</li>

"49624","Is Game of thrones series inspired by The accursed kings series?","<p>I finished watching the 3rd season of GoT recently. The serial is really great. But I suddenly recalled reading long ago a series of books called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Accursed_Kings"" rel=""nofollow"">The Accursed Kings</a> by Maurice Druon. And I see a lot of parallels.</p>

<p>Now, The Accursed Kings tells us a story about the French kingdom in XIV century, and the battle for the throne between several branches of the ruling dinasty. The principle ""Everybody dies"", which GoT is famous for, perfectly fits for AkK:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> The Iron King, the main hero of the first book, dies at the end of the first book.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, there is an adultery line</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> The wives of two king sons cheat on their husbands, which lead to the fight for who should actually claim the the throne after Iron King is gone. <p>Also, the english queen cheats on her husband and takes part in murder of Edward the II. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The main difference is, as I see it, the presence of fantasy in GoT. But, without it, the two series have a very close style.</p>

<p>So, why is that? Was George Martin officially inspired by Druon books, or it was just because they both took inspiration in medieval history?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","49625","<p>Yes, Martin was inspired by Maurice Druon among others. Read what Martin has to say on the book in the <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0007491255"">reprint's</a> introduction:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My own series draws on both traditions . . . and while I undoubtedly drew much of my inspiration from Tolkien, Vance, Howard, and the other fantasists who came before me, A Game of Thrones and its sequels were also influenced by the works of great historical novelists like Thomas B.

<p>As I understand it, Robb, as first born male, would inherit the titles of Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, and all the land of Winterfell to go with it. The girls, Sansa and Arya, would most likely be married to secure alliances with other powerful houses. Jon, as a bastard, wouldn't have had many useful prospects, which is a large part of why he decides to join the Night Watch.</p>

<p>But what about the other two boys?</p>

<p>I checked on the Game of Thrones wiki for a while but I saw no information about what the younger Starks were supposed to do when they got older. Would they inherit ""smaller"" portions of Winterfell or the north? Would they need to marry themselves to another house in order to ""earn"" their own ""domains""?</p>

<li><p><strong>Independent adventurer:</strong> The most spectacular example is Euron Greyjoy, who sailed off to parts unknown while his brother Balon Greyjoy ruled the Iron Islands.</p></li>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","183572","<p>These were rumours and no one really knew what happened. </p>

<p>For example, Eddard, who actually was at King's Landing when (Or just a few hours later) this happened. Even he thinks of it as rumours.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unlike his brother, Ser Gregor did not live at court. He was a
  solitary man who seldom left his own lands, but for wars and tourneys.
  He had been with Lord Tywin when King's Landing fell, a new-made
  knight of seventeen years, even then distinguished by his size and his
  implacable ferocity. <strong>Some said it had been Gregor who'd dashed the
  skull of the infant prince Aegon Targaryen against a wall, and
  whispered that afterward he had raped the mother, the Dornish princess
  Elia, before putting her to the sword</strong>. These things were not said in
  Gregor's hearing.<br><sub><strong>AGOT - Eddard VII</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If even people who were there to observe the immediate aftermath of the act don't know it for sure, we can safely assume that no one did. But of course Gregor's own men must have known, his comrades too possibly who may have had the opportunity to witness the Princess' corpse. And we know that Mountain's men are prone to bragging about his rapes as they did with him raping the daughter of an innkeeper after the Hand's Tourney in front of Arya and other soldiers. So word naturally spread, which we can expect was especially fast as the rumour was about the former Queen-to-be, A Princess of Dorne and her tragic death.</p>

<p>Robert later ordered an inquiry but it was just a show, he was not going to break off his Lannister alliance, so it's not a surprise that it did not establish anything.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Wars and weddings have kept us well occupied, Prince Oberyn. <strong>I fear
  no one has yet had the time to look into murders sixteen years
  stale</strong>, dreadful as they were. We shall, of course, just as soon as
  we may. <strong>Any help that Dorne might be able to provide to restore the
  king's peace would only hasten the beginning of my lord father's
  inquiry—</strong>""</p>
  
  <p>""Dwarf,"" said the Red Viper, in a tone grown markedly less cordial,
  ""spare me your Lannister lies. Is it sheep you take us for, or fools?
  My brother is not a bloodthirsty man, but neither has he been asleep
  for sixteen years. <strong>Jon Arryn came to Sunspear the year after Robert
  took the throne, and you can be sure that he was questioned closely</strong>.
  Him, and a hundred more. I did not come for some mummer's show of an
  inquiry. I came for justice for Elia and her children, and I will have
  it. <strong>Starting with this lummox Gregor Clegane . . . but not, I think,
  ending there. Before he dies, the Enormity That Rides will tell me
  whence came his orders, please assure your lord father of that</strong>."" He
  smiled.<br><sub><strong>ASOS - Tyrion V</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, as you can notice, Tyrion does not mention the rape when he speaks of a new inquiry, neither does Oberyn. Elia and her children being murdered was undisputed, the rape however remained just a rumour. Oberyn still could have insisted on investigation of those charges as well but for some reason it did not happen.</p>

<p>Between themselves, when discussing the justice, Tyrion and his father talked only as if the murder charges were the only ones that Oberyn knew of for sure and even at that, he did not have any evidence as to who was the real culprit. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Very well, as you ask so pleasantly. The Red Viper is not going to be
  pleasant, I fear... nor will he content himself with Ser Gregor’s head
  alone.”</p>
  
  <p>“All the more reason not to give it to him.”</p>
  
  <p>“Not to... ?” Tyrion was shocked. “I thought we were agreed that the
  woods were full of beasts.”</p>
  
  <p>“Lesser beasts.” Lord Tywin’s fingers laced together under his chin.
  “Ser Gregor has served us well. No other knight in the realm inspires
  such terror in our enemies.”</p>
  
  <p>“<strong>Oberyn knows that Gregor was the one who</strong>...”</p>
  
  <p>“<strong>He knows nothing. He has heard tales. Stable gossip and kitchen
  calumnies. He has no crumb of proof. Ser Gregor is certainly not about
  to confess to him. I mean to keep him well away for so long as the
  Dornishmen are in King’s Landing.</strong>”</p>
  
  <p>“And when Oberyn demands the justice he’s come for?”</p>
  
  <p>“I will tell him that Ser Amory Lorch killed Elia and her children,”
  Lord Tywin said calmly. “So will you, if he asks.”</p>
  
  <p>“Ser Amory Lorch is dead,” Tyrion said flatly.</p>
  
  <p>“Precisely. Vargo Hoat had Ser Amory torn apart by a bear after the
  fall of Harrenhal. That ought to be sufficiently grisly to appease
  even Oberyn Martell.”<br><sub><strong>ASOS - Tyrion VI</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the rape did happen, Tywin Lannister, Commander of the men who did it, is confident that it happened. He however claims that he never intended to harm Elia and she should have been unharmed.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>His father shrugged. “I grant you, it was done too brutally. <strong>Elia
  need not have been harmed at all, that was sheer folly. By herself she
  was nothing</strong>.”</p>
  
  <p>“Then why did the Mountain kill her?”</p>
  
  <p>“Because I did not tell him to spare her. I doubt I mentioned her at
  all. I had more pressing concerns. Ned Stark’s van was rushing south
  from the Trident, and I feared it might come to swords between us. And
  it was in Aerys to murder Jaime, with no more cause than spite. That
  was the thing I feared most. That, and what Jaime himself might do.”
  He closed a fist. “Nor did I yet grasp what I had in Gregor Clegane,
  only that he was huge and terrible in battle. <strong>The rape... even you
  will not accuse me of giving that command, I would hope.</strong> Ser Amory
  was almost as bestial with Rhaenys. I asked him afterward why it had
  required half a hundred thrusts to kill a girl of... two? Three? He
  said she’d kicked him and would not stop screaming. If Lorch had
  halfthe wits the gods gave a turnip, he would have calmed her with a
  few sweet words and used a soft silk pillow.” His mouth twisted in
  distaste. “The blood was in him.”<br><sub><strong>ASOS - Tyrion VI</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But later, Tyrion admitted in front of Oberyn that the rape did happen and who was the rapist, confirming his doubts. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""How sad for him,"" said the Red Viper. ""And for you. Do all noseless
  men lie so badly, I wonder?""</p>
  
  <p>""I am not lying. Ser Amory dragged Princess Rhaenys out from under her
  father's bed and stabbed her to death. He had some men-at-arms with
  him, but I do not know their names."" He leaned forward. ""<strong>It was Ser
  Gregor Clegane who smashed Prince Aegon's head against a wall and
  raped your sister Elia with his blood and brains still on his
  hands</strong>.""</p>
  
  <p>""<strong>What is this, now? Truth, from a Lannister</strong>?"" Oberyn smiled
  coldly. ""Your father gave the commands, yes?""<br><sub><strong>ASOS - Tyrion IX</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So by the time Oberyn met Gregor, he was certain and he needed only Gregor's confession, which he did receive. </p>

<p>In Conclusion:</p>

<ol>
<li>There were only rumours. </li>
<li>Lannisters believed Martells had no proof.</li>
<li>Rape did happen. </li>
<li>By the time Oberyn met Gregor in combat, he was certain about the rape and that Gregor had done it, thanks to Tyrion.</li>

  <strong>These changes were simplifications, however.</strong> The books are very complex, but the practical limits of a television series call for a bit more simplicity. Dropping a king or two accomplishes that.</p>

  <p>There came a soft knock on her door.</p>
  
  <p>""Come,"" Dany said, turning away from the window. Illyrio's servants

  <p>They were slaves, a gift from one of the magister's many Dothraki
  friends. There was no slavery in the free city of Pentos. Nonetheless,
  they were slaves.</p>
  
  <p>The old woman, small and grey as a mouse, never said a word, but the
  girl made up for it. She was Illyrio's favorite, a fair-haired,
  blue-eyed wench of sixteen who chattered constantly as she worked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is it mentioned if he is at risk of being caught or punished for having the slaves?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","49935","<p>Politics and money.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: if you have not completed the series, SPOILER ALERT.</strong></p>

<p>First, politics: Illyrio's refusal to bow to the law of Pentos is symbolic of his character. He believes himself above those laws. Second, money: Illyrio is probably a slave trader, so the household slaves aren't necessarily the extent of his slaveholdings.</p>

<p>The matter is revisited twice in <em>A Dance With Dragons</em>. First, in chapter 2:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Slaves?"" the dwarf asked pointedly.
  The fat man stroked one of the prongs of his oiled yellow beard, a gesture Tyrion found remarkably obscene. ""Slavery is forbidden in Pentos, by the terms of the treaty the Braavosi imposed on us a hundred years ago. Still, they will not refuse you.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Illyrio is allied with the Targaryens, and believes that their rule is the future. In other words, he believes that he is bigger than Pentos. Further, pointing out that the law comes from Braavos, not from Pentos, implies that the law is unnatural to Pentos. That then is justification for ignoring it.</p>

<p>Illyrio's relationship with slavery is expanded on in chapter 5:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tyrion pondered all that he knew of Volantis, oldest and proudest of
  the Nine Free Cities. Something was awry here. Even with half a nose,
  he could smell it. ""It's said that there are five slaves for every
  free man in Volantis. Why would the triarchs assist a queen who
  smashed the slave trade?"" He pointed at Illyrio. ""For that matter, why
  would you? <strong>Slavery may be forbidden by the laws of Pentos, yet you
  have a finger in that trade as well, and maybe a whole hand</strong>. And yet
  you conspire for the dragon queen, and not against her. Why? What do
  you hope to gain from Queen Daenerys?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Emphasis added)</p>

<p>Illyrio responds with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The Beggar King swore that I should be his master of coin, and a
  lordly lord as well. Once he wore his golden crown, I should have my
  choice of castles... even Casterly Rock, if I desired. [...] My manse
  is large enough for any man, and more comfortable than your drafty
  Westerosi castles. Master of coin, though...""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This exchange reveals why Illyrio is helping the Targaryens. It also, however, reveals that Illyrio is not only a slaveholder, but also probably a slave <em>trader</em>. It is, then, a source of his wealth - and as the passage just illustrated, Illyrio will go very far, and take many risks, for money. Even defying Pentos law.</p>

<p>In answer to your second question, no: the danger/consequences of discovery are never mentioned. This supports the reader's impression of Illyrio as a powerful man, to have no concern about breaking the law.</p>

<p>Could Ned not suspect that he might want revenge or something from the Starks?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","50009","<p>The idea was to raise Theon as a member of the Stark family, so that he would come to understand and respect the ways of Winterfell. That included allowing him to ride around the woods and handle weapons. This was common practice with ancient and medieval hostage taking. From <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage</a> :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The practice of taking hostages is very ancient, and has been used
  constantly in negotiations with conquered nations, and in cases such
  as surrenders, armistices and the like, where the two belligerents
  depended for its proper carrying out on each other's good faith. The
  Romans were accustomed to take the sons of tributary princes and
  educate them at Rome, thus holding a security for the continued
  loyalty of the conquered nation and also instilling a possible future
  ruler with ideas of Roman civilization.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Theon <em>could</em> have tried to kill Eddard or one of the Stark children to avenge his brothers. But if he did so, he would probably be hunted down by the surviving Starks or their bannermen. It's a very long way from Winterfell to the Iron Islands; Theon's chances of making the journey as a fugitive who was wanted for murdering a Stark would be rather slim. </p>

<p>Not only that, he would have dishonoured his father and likely provoked a war between the Iron Islands and the rest of the Seven Kingdoms -- a war which, prior to the death of Robert Baratheon, the Iron Islands would almost certainly lose. So he would have been less than welcome if he reached the Iron Islands. Theon knew all this, and in any event he seems to have liked and respected Eddard and his children, having been taken to Winterfell at a very young age.</p>

<p>Finally, there is no indication in the books that Eddard fully trusted Theon. Eddard was never alone with Theon, and he didn't send Theon far away from Winterfell, much less order him to visit the Iron Islands. As Thundergr points out, that was Robb's mistake.</p>

As for Dany, she is at that point just a young girl who's been sold off to a barbarian chieftain. Besides, Ser Jorah has feelings for her that wouldn't fit well with seeing her as a dragon, and that does become an issue later on.</p>

"50235","What was Littlefinger's motivation for the Purple Wedding?","<p>As realized in the second half of A Storm of Swords and early in Season 4 of the TV series, Littlefinger conspires to </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> kill Joffrey at his wedding to Margaery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Afterwards, he discusses this with Sansa:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> ""Why should I wish him dead?"" Littlefinger shrugged. ""I had no motive ... Sometimes the best way to baffle [your foes] is to make moves that have no purpose, or even seem to work against you.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But is Littlefinger being entirely truthful? Surely he had some motivation for the plot, beyond just confusing his opponents?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","50274","<p>It's very hard to come up with why Littlefinger does anything, since he's very private with his true intentions. All we can come up with are a few guesses. As I see it, there are only two reasons Littlefinger might do anything: to advance his power and political position, and for pure personal reasons.</p>

<h2>Political Agenda</h2>

<p>Littlefinger lost the hand of the love of his life because his name had no power behind it, and ever since he has been working hard to change that. In the span of 15 years or so, he went from the son of an impoverished lord to the Master of Coin of Westeros, Lord Paramount of the Trident, the Lord Protector of the Vale and Lord of Harrenhal. And it's quite obvious he doesn't have plans to stop. </p>

<p>Assassinating Joffrey accomplished several things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Removed Joffrey, who was by all accounts hard to control. In his place is now young Tommen, who has no real power of his own yet. Making the throne much easier to influence.</li>
<li>Get the favor of Tyrells who now wield great power in the council through Mace Tyrell, the Kingsguard through Loras Tyrell, and the throne itself through Queen Margaery. </li>
<li>Gained control of Sansa Stark, who is (as far as everyone knows) the heir to the North. Now if Littlefinger's scheme of marrying Harry the Heir to Sansa works, he will gain control of the North and the Vale.</li>
</ul>

<p>So through all these machinations Littlefinger can potentially control the North, the Vale and the Riverlands, as well as having considerable influence with the Tyrells who control the South and are largely the power behind the Iron Throne (now that Tywin and Cersie have been neutralized). So one can argue that Littlefinger is now, or is going to be, one of the most powerful men in Westeros if not <em>the</em> most powerful. </p>

<h2>Personal Agenda</h2>

<p>Here it is pure speculation, since we have no insight on how Littlefinger thinks. I can't think of Littlefinger having any daggers to hone with Joffrey. However, we do know he still retained his love for Cat, and he thinks she was killed by the Lannisters. </p>

<p>More likely, I think, is that Littlefinger harbors a grudge with <em>all</em> the Great Houses. After all, he lost Cat to the heir of House Stark. But even with House Stark all but extinguished, his machinations continue. Which hints that his revenge plot (if it does indeed exist) encompasses all the families that have looked down on him in the past.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/QALeZ.gif"" alt=""Wildfire""></p>
","<game-of-thrones>","50455","<h2>Temperature</h2>

<p>According to the TV Series, burning wilfire is capable of melting the following substances;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The Substance burns so hot it melts <strong>wood</strong>, <strong>stone</strong>... even <strong>steel</strong>... and,
  of course, flesh!. The Substance burns so hot it melts <strong>flesh</strong>... like
  tallow.""</p>

<p>Assuming the maester is correct, it will burn hot enough to melt <a href=""http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/melting-temperature-metals-d_860.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">steel</a> (at approx 1500°C) and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granite"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">stone</a> (at approx 1200°C). Although they explicitly mention melting wood, the reality is that the temperature required to achieve such a <a href=""http://www.yalescientific.org/2010/05/everyday-qa-can-you-melt-a-wooden-log/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">feat</a> (approx 3500°C) strongly suggests that this is mere hyperbole.</p>

<h2>Composition</h2>

<p>From the same canon source, we also know that it combusts readily in the presence of urine and burns with a green flame. </p>

<p>While there are a variety of elements that burn with a green flame (including copper, antimony, selenium, tellurium, thallium and barium) the only one of these elements that would readily react with the water in urine is Barium which would cause steam, heat and highly combustible hydrogen gas, potentially leading to an explosion.</p>

<h2>Appearance</h2>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ql2Oe.jpg"" alt=""Wildfire Liquid""></p>

<p>Wildfire is stored as a greenish transparent liquid. According to Bronn it's highly combustible and can explode from merely being handled ungently.</p>

<h2>Out of Universe</h2>

<p>The wildfire that was used to coat Baris' 'Flaming sword' is <a href=""http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/2012/12/6/prop-closeup-berics-flaming-sword.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">composed of</a> ""Isopropyl Alcohol"" and kept alight with ""a small pilot light"". The flame was artificially coloured using CGI effects by Pixomondo, who won an Effects Emmy for the series.</p>

<p>According to various fan sites, the liquid version is allegedly distilled water mixed with glycol and green food colouring although I've been unable to locate a canon confirmation.</p>

<p>Why did Roose use such a risky (and possibly unnecessary) tactic when he is supposed to be a man of caution?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","52603","<p>As there have not been (as of A Dance With Dragons) any Roose PoV chapters or any chapter where he talked about this battle, we may only speculate on his reasoning.</p>

<p><a href=""http://bryndenbfish.wordpress.com/2014/01/23/early-evidence-of-roose-boltons-treason/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This article</a> speculates, with varying amounts of evidence that Bolton, while not exactly an ally to the Lannisters since the beginning, was certainly disloyal to the Starks, trying to further his own ambitions while undermining the strength of his liege lord and his loyal bannermen.</p>

<p>Regarding this specific battle, we can see two interesting quotes from the book that show that Bolton's forces haven't suffered so much in this defeat:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He glimpsed the bull moose of the Hornwoods, the Karstark sunburst, Lord Cerwyn’s battle-axe, and the mailed fist of the Glovers ... and the twin towers of Frey. (AGOT, Tyrion VIII)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“My liege, we have taken some of their commanders. Lord Cerwyn, Ser Wylis Manderly, Harrion Karstark, four Freys. Lord Hornwood is dead, and I fear Roose Bolton has escaped us.” (AGOT, Tyrion VIII)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This has not been the last time Roose Bolton's forces had separated from the remaining bannermen's, to their loss. At the Battle of Duskendale, which was Roose Bolton's idea (to which he did not commit any forces), he had similarly sacrificed the lives of his ""allies"" as opposed to his own:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Tell him to put the captives to the sword and the castle to the torch, by command of the king. Then he is to join forces with Robett Glover and strike east toward Duskendale. Those are rich lands, and hardly touched by the fighting. It is time they had a taste. Glover has lost a castle, and Tallhart a son. Let them take their vengeance on Duskendale.” (ACOK, Arya X)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""As for Stark, the boy is still in the west, but a large force of northmen under Helman Tallhart and Robett Glover are descending toward Duskendale. I’ve sent Lord Tarly to meet them, while Ser Gregor drives up the kingsroad to cut off their retreat. Tallhart and Glover will be caught between them, with a third of Stark’s strength.”
  “Duskendale?” There was nothing at Duskendale worth such a risk. Had the Young Wolf finally blundered? (ASOS, Tyrion I)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The result was a large defeat for the North:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The eunuch smiled a silken smile. “I have such delicious tidings for you all, my lords. Yesterday at dawn our brave Lord Randyll caught Robett Glover outside Duskendale and trapped him against the sea. Losses were heavy on both sides, but in the end our loyal men prevailed. Ser Helman Tallhart is reported dead, with a thousand others. Robett Glover leads the survivors back toward Harrenhal in bloody disarray, little dreaming he will find valiant Ser Gregor and his stalwarts athwart his path.” (ASOS, Tyrion III)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When they brought him word of the battle at Duskendale, where Lord Randyll Tarly had shattered Robett Glover and Ser Helman Tallhart, he might have been expected to rage. Instead he’d stared in dumb disbelief and said, “Duskendale, on the narrow sea? Why would they go to Duskendale?” He’d shook his head, bewildered. “A third of my foot, lost for <em>Duskendale</em>?” (ASOS, Catelyn IV)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only that, when Roose Bolton left Harrenhall to rejoin the Starks, more loyal bannermen fell:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Two-thirds of my strength was on the north side when the Lannisters attacked those still waiting to cross. Norrey, Locke, and Burley men chiefly, with Ser Wylis Manderly and his White Harbor knights as rear guard. I was on the wrong side of the Trident, powerless to help them. Ser Wylis rallied our men as best he could, but Gregor Clegane attacked with heavy horse and drove them into the river. As many drowned as were cut down. More fled, and the rest were taken captive.” (ASOS, Catelyn VI)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Roose Bolton's caution has been proven in all of these interactions. What is to be questioned is his loyalty. Which the event of the Red Wedding has proven.</p>

<h1>Major Roles</h1>

<h3>Ser Gregor Clegane (The Mountain)</h3>

<p>Originally played by Conan Stevens in Season 1 he was recast to Ian Whyte in Season 2 and finally to Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson for Seasons 4 to 7 (and I believe 8).</p>

<p>For a bit of trivia here Ian Whyte is <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1480055/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast"" rel=""noreferrer"">credited</a> as playing White Walker #1 in the prologue to the series.</p>

<h3>Daario Naharis</h3>

<p>Was originally played by Ed Skrein in Season 3 but was recast to Michiel Huisman for Seasons 4 to 6 due to a scheduling conflict for Ed.</p>

<h3>Tommen Baratheon</h3>

<p>Played by Callum Wharry for Seasons 1 and 2 but was recast to Dean-Charles Chapman. Bryan Cogman talks about this <a href=""https://winteriscoming.net/2014/05/14/game-owns-bryan-cogman-returns/"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> but he essentially states that they wanted a more experienced actor.</p>

<p>For a bit of trivia here Dean-Charles originally played Martyn Lannister in Season 3 before that character was killed off.</p>

<h3>Three-Eyed Raven</h3>

<p>Was played by Struan Rodger in Season 4 in the finale and was taken over by Max von Sydow for Season 6.</p>

<h3>Night King</h3>

<p>Was originally played by Richard Brake for Seasons 4 and 5 but was recast to Vladimír Furdík for Seasons 6 and 7 (and likely 8). The new actor also played the First Man version of the character.</p>

<h3>Beric Dondarrion</h3>

<p>Was played by David Michael Scott for Season 1 in a minor role but changed to Richard Dormer for Seasons 3, 6 and 7 (also potentially 8).</p>

<h1>Minor Roles</h1>

<h3>Myrcella Baratheon</h3>

<p>Played by Aimee Richardson for Seasons 1 and 2 but was recast to Nell Tiger Free for Seasons 5 and 6.</p>

<h3>Lord of Bones</h3>

<p>Was played by Edward Dogliani for Seasons 2 and 3 but was recast to Ross O'Hennessy for a brief appearance in Season 5.</p>

<h3>Lothar Frey</h3>

<p>Played by Tom Brooke for Season 3 and Daniel Tuite for Season 6.</p>

<h3>Dickon Tarly</h3>

<p>Was played by Freddie Stroma for Season 6 but recast to Tom Hopper for Season 7 due to a scheduling conflict.</p>

<h3>Leaf</h3>

<p>Originally played by the child actor Octavia Alexandru in Season 4 and was recast to Kae Alexander for Season 6.</p>

<h3>Richard Karstark</h3>

<p>Played by Steven Blount for Season 1 and John Stahl for Seasons 2 and 3.</p>

<h3>Ghost</h3>

<p>As mentioned in <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/184411/58193"">@Möoz's answer</a> the pup Ghost was played by a Northern Innuit for Season 1 and then the wolf Quigly from Season 5 and 6 (and hopefully 8).</p>

<h3>Summer and Nymeria</h3>

<p><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1201204/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Andrew Simpson</a> from <a href=""http://www.instinctforfilm.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Instinct for Film</a> is credited as having been involved in the show since Season 5. He is credited for Season 7 Episode 2, ""Stormborn"", where only Nymeria shows up. Season 6 Episode 5, ""The Door"", where only Summer shows up.</p>

<p>It is likely that Grey Wind and Shaggydog were also recast after Season 1 but I haven't found anything to confirm this yet.</p>

<hr>

<p>The above mentioned wikia page lists a few ""Placeholder"" characters who were essentially extras and then cast into named roles later on. As such the characters weren't really recast but they are worth a quick mention.</p>

<ul>
<li>High Septon</li>
<li>Selyse Baratheon</li>
</ul>

<p>This page does mention Beric Dondarrion and Richard Karstark here but I disagree with the wikia here and instead think of these as actual re-castings.</p>

<hr>

<p>Worth a mention are the characters that were recast from the pilot to the main production.</p>

<h3>Daenerys Targaryen</h3>

<p>Played by Tamzin Merchant and then changed to Emilia Clarke.</p>

<h3>Catelyn Stark</h3>

<p>Played by Jennifer Ehle and then changed to Michelle Fairley.</p>

<h3>Illyrio Mopatis</h3>

<p>Played by Ian McNeice and then changed to Roger Allam.</p>

<h3>Gared</h3>

<p>Played by Richard Ridings and then changed to Dermot Keaney.</p>

<h3>Ser Waymar Royce</h3>

<p>Played by Jamie Campbell Bower and then changed to Rob Ostlere.</p>

<hr>

<p>An honourable mention is Grand Maester Pycelle who was originally meant to be played by Roy Dotrice. However, due to health reasons he had to pull out and we got Julian Glover instead for Seasons 1 through 6. Dotrice eventually plays Hallyne, the pyromancer in Season 2.</p>

<p>The key part being that they're castrated, often at a very young age.

<p>Renly also showed that he didn't feel that the normal rules of succession were too important. He made it clear that it was strength and power that won the throne. He once said that the Targaryens didn't have any right to Westeros, they conquered it; Robert didn't have any right to the throne, he took it. Clearly he felt that he would make a better king, had the army to take it, and therefore deserved the crown.</p>

<p>In order to earn sufficient links to call oneself a 'maester', it seems likely that you would need to study as an apprentice for around 10 years but potentially up to 20 before you are awarded the title. This is borne out by the advanced ages of the vast majority of maesters seen as well as our own <em>contemporary</em> understanding of the time needed to achieve multiple doctorates.</p>

<h2>How many links are needed...</h2>

<p>From the TV series, we can see that the chains seem to contain approximately 20 links and from <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Dragon_Limbs_and_Gender_Valyrain_Weapons_and_Maesters_Chains/"" rel=""noreferrer"">a quote</a> from GRRM we know that maesters can be awarded <em>multiple</em> links of the same metal if they are especially proficient in a particular area of knowledge. This suggests that a maester never finishes learning or earning links.</p>

  <p><em>[Can a maester's chain include multiple links of the same metal?]</em><br>

<p>Certain links, such as ravenry can only be awarded by an ""<em>Archmaester</em>"" whereas other links can be granted by the mutual assent of other maesters or presumably even be self-awarded.</p>

<p><a href=""http://wiki.westeros.org/index.php/Maesters#The_collar"" rel=""noreferrer"">Some links</a> such as Black Steel (Ravenry), Copper (History), Silver (Medicine), Pewter (unknown) and Bronze (Astronomy) seem common and relatively easy to attain since they're held by first and second-year students. Others such as Gold (Economics), Iron (Warfare) and Electrum (unknown) are particularly rare and seem to mark the passage into becoming a full-fledged Maester. </p>

<p>Valyrian Steel links (for the study of Magic + the Occult) are <em>exceedingly</em> rare and held by less than one Maester in a hundred. Ironically, they aren't seen as especially <em>prestigious</em> but rather viewed with suspicion.</p>

  <p>Luwin slid a finger up under his collar and began to turn it, inch by inch. He had a thick neck for a small man, and the chain was tight, but a few pulls had it all the way around. ""This is Valyrian steel,"" he said when the link of dark grey metal lay against the apple of his throat. ""<strong>Only one maester in a hundred wears such a link.</strong> This signifies that I have studied what the Citadel calls the higher mysteries—magic, for want of a better word. A fascinating pursuit, but of small use, which is why so few maesters trouble themselves with it.<br>

<p><sub>A Dance with Dragons - Jon X</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This can be explained by the fact that the Night's Watch allows small folk to rise in hierarchy, so anyone which is, to summarize, a bastard that wields a sword well enough can become a commander:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You are,&quot; Sam agreed, &quot;but Cotter Pyke might serve. It's said he has oft proved himself in battle.&quot; He did not mean to offend Ser Denys by praising his rival, but how else could he convince him to withdraw?</p>
<p>&quot;Many of my brothers have proved themselves in battle. It is not enough. Some matters cannot be settled with a battleaxe. Maester Aemon will understand that, though Cotter Pyke does not. The Lord Commander of the Night's Watch is a lord, first and foremost. He must be able to treat with other lords . . . and with kings as well. He must be a man worthy of respect.&quot; Ser Denys leaned forward. &quot;We are the sons of great lords, you and I. We know the importance of birth, blood, and that early training that can ne'er be replaced. I was a squire at twelve, a knight at eighteen, a champion at two-and-twenty. I have been the commander at the Shadow Tower for thirty-three years. Blood, birth, and training have fitted me to deal with kings. Pyke . . . well, did you hear him this morning, asking if His Grace would wipe his bottom? Samwell, it is not my habit to speak unkindly of my brothers, but let us be frank . . . the ironborn are a race of pirates and thieves, and Cotter Pyke was raping and murdering when he was still half a boy. Maester Harmune reads and writes his letters, and has for years. No, loath as I am to disappoint Maester Aemon, I could not in honor stand aside for Pyke of Eastwatch.&quot;</p>
<p><sub>A Storm of Swords - Samwell V</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, the fact that a commander, ruling a castle is illiterate seems quite odd. Are there any other cases where a Night's Watch commander or any other Lord of the Seven Kingdoms couldn't write/read or is Cotter Pyke's case unique?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","185432","<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Those mentioned in my answer are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Davos Seaworth</li>
<li>Bronn</li>
<li>Amory Lorch</li>
<li>Dunk</li>
</ul>

<p>However, it's likely most lowborn people who come to a higher position later in life are likely illiterate.</p>

<hr>

<p>As for members of the Night's Watch I couldn't find any explicit case but it wouldn't be surprising to know if they have had an illiterate member in the higher ranks.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You do it. They have parchment and ink at the Citadel, as well as longbows. I will expect you to continue with your practice. Sam, the Night's Watch has hundreds of men who can loose an arrow, <strong>but only a handful who can read or write.</strong> I need you to become my new maester.""<br>
  <sub>A Dance with Dragons, Jon II</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we consider First Rangers and Wandering Crows as higher ups/commanders in the Night's Watch then there's probably been a good few among them who were illiterate. Assuming from the known names that if someone has a surname, and so a House, they likely had a Maester's teaching then we have no known illiterate First Ranger but we have a few Wandering Crows who have no House: Conwy, Dareon, Gueren and Yoren.</p>

<p>Opening this up to any Lord we have the case of Lord Davos Seaworth who could not read or write.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Obediently, he selected a paper at random. ""It looks handsome enough, Your Grace, but <strong>I fear I cannot read the words.</strong>"" Davos could decipher maps and charts as well as any, but <strong>letters and other writings were beyond his powers.</strong> But my Devan has learned his letters, and young Steffon and Stannis as well.<br>

</blockquote>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>""I am lowborn,""</strong> Davos reminded him. ""An upjumped smuggler. Your lords will never obey me.""<br>
  ""Then we will make new lords.""<br>
  <strong>""But... I cannot read... nor write...""</strong><br>
  <sub>A Storm of Swords, Davos IV</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Davos' case is of course different to most Lords as he was lowborn and rose to be a knight and a lord later on in life so never got a Maester's teachings early on. As this story is likely similar to other people we could probably safely assume Ser Bronn of the Blackwater is also illiterate as mentioned in <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/185431/58193"">@dna's answer</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bronn grinned. ""My knightly sigil. A flaming chain, green, on a smoke-grey field. By your lord father's command, I'm Ser Bronn of the Blackwater now, Imp. See you don't forget it.""<br>
  <sub>A Storm of Swords, Tyrion I</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bronn later marries into House Stokeworth and becomes their Lord.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Bronn put a dagger in his eye, and told me I had best be gone from Stokeworth before the sun went down or I'd get the same. He said he'd pass me around to the g-g-garrison, if any of them would have me. <strong>When I ordered Bronn seized, one of his knights had the insolence to say that I should do as Lord Stokeworth said. He called him Lord Stokeworth!</strong>"" Lady Falyse clutched at the queen's hand. ""Your Grace must give me knights. A hundred knights! And crossbowmen, to take my castle back. Stokeworth is mine! They would not even permit me to gather up my clothes! Bronn said they were his wife's clothes now, all my s-silks and velvets.""<br>
  <sub>A Feast for Crows, Cersei VII</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In fact it is explicitly stated by Tyrion that Bronn could not read.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That night, when the Red Keep was dark, Bronn arrived to find him sealing a letter. ""Take this to Ser Jacelyn Bywater."" The dwarf dribbled hot golden wax down onto the parchment.<br>
  ""What does it say?"" <strong>Bronn could not read</strong>, so he asked impudent questions.<br>
  <sub>A Clash of Kings, Tyrion X</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the show we also have Ser Amory Lorch who accidentally sent a letter to House Dormand instead of House Marbrand because he could not read it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tywin Lannister:</strong> Can you read? My lord? Can you read? This letter detailing our infantry movements was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand. It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.<br>
  <strong>Armory Lorch:</strong> My apologies, my lord.<br>
  <sub>Game of Thrones, Season 2 Episode 6, ""The Old Gods and the New""</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As @DariM points out later in the same episode Tywin tells Arya of Jaime struggling to read and so Tywin taught him himself. It also appears from the below that Jaime is dyslexic.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tywin Lannister:</strong> Who taught you to read?<br>
  <strong>Arya Stark:</strong> My father, my lord.<br>
  <strong>Tywin Lannister:</strong> Hmm. I taught my son Jaime to read. The maester came to me one day, told me he wasn't learning. He couldn't make sense of the letters. He reversed them in his head. The maester said he'd heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it. Ha! After that, I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned. He hated me for it, for a time. For a long time. But he learned.<br>
  <sub>ibid</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>From this we can infer that low or high born in Westeros not everyone will be able to read even if they have access to a maester's teachings. Jaime can only read now because Tywin did not give up when the maesters had already done so.</p>

<p>In the Dunk and Egg stories we also learn that Dunk, later Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, is illiterate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The old man had ridden with some of these knights; others Dunk knew from tales told in common rooms and round campfires. <strong>Though he had never learned the magic of reading or writing</strong>, the old man had been relentless when it came to teaching him heraldry, often drilling him as they rode.<br>

<p></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dunk the lunk, thick as a castle wall. He felt his cheeks reddening again. <strong>Gingerly he took the parchment from the maester and scowled at the writing. Not a word of it was intelligible to him</strong>, but he knew the wax seal beneath the ornate signature; the three-headed dragon of House Targaryen. The king's seal. He was looking at a royal decree of some sort. <strong>Dunk moved his head from side to side so they would think that he was reading.</strong> ""There's a word here I can't make out,"" he muttered, after a moment.

<h2>A Clash of Kings</h2>

<p>The song is sung at the harvest feast at Winterfell.</p>

<h2>A Storm of Swords</h2>

<p>Tom of Sevenstreams sings it with Hot Pie on the ride to the Inn of the Kneeling Man. When Tom wants someone to sing with, Hot Pie tells him he knows the song about the bear. Tom starts to sing it and Hot Pie joins in lustily, even bouncing in his saddle a little on the rhymes. Arya Stark is astonished; Hot Pie has a good voice and sings well, she thought all he could do was bake. </p>

<p>During the grim march back to Craster's Keep after the Fist Grenn tries to encourage Samwell Tarly to keep marching by telling him to sing a song in his head. Sam knows a hundred songs but is so terrified he cannot think of any. Grenn suggests ""The Bear and the Maiden Fair"" and starts to sing it - but Sam begs him not to as it makes him think of the hideous wight-bear that had come at them at the Fist. </p>

<p>It is sung by Butterbumps at Sansa Stark's dinner with Margaery Tyrell and Olenna Redwyne to cover the conversation about Joffrey Baratheon. </p>

<p>Greatjon Umber sings it, drunkenly, at the Red Wedding.</p>

<p>During the Battle of Yunkai Ser Barristan Selmy tells Daenerys Targaryen that Robert Baratheon liked songs that made him laugh. Barristan adds that Robert only sang when he was drunk, and then by that point one of the songs was likely to be the ""The Bear and the Maiden Fair"". </p>

<h2>Feast for Crows</h2>

  <p> It is sung by Dareon on the voyage to Braavos.</p>

<h2>A Dance With Dragons</h2>

  <p> The song is sung by Abel for Barbrey Dustin during a meal at Winterfell. In Meereen Tyrion Lannister realizes that Ser Jorah Mormont is doomed if purchased by Zahrina. Tyrion manages to get the slave overseer Nurse to convince Yezzan zo Qaggaz to purchase Jorah by lying and telling Nurse that Jorah is part of their show - the bear and the maiden fair. Jorah is the bear, Penny is the maiden, and Tyrion is the brave knight who rescues her. During their bondage Tyrion notes that Jorah has not adapted well. When called upon to play the bear and carry off the maiden fair, he has been sullen and uncooperative, shuffling lifelessly through his paces when he deigns to take part in their mummery at all.</p>

<p>Letters/correspondence in Westeros are sealed with 1) the house sigil in wax or 2) the emblem of the position (e.g. the Hand of the King). </p>

<li>Littlefinger seems on distancing himself from his humble background and creating a new identity, which would lead me to believe he would use personal sigil (as we see on the ship's sails he uses to <s> kidnap </s> rescue Sansa).</li>
<li>Would other Lords recognize his personal sigil? I know Baelish is infamous as Master of Coin, but do all the Lords know his name directly?  Would it matter, since once the letter is opened it is also signed?</li>
<li>I am not sure that the Master of Coin is shown to have its own emblem like the Hand of the King does. Also, he does not hold this position anymore.</li>

<p>My personal (and unfounded) theory is that the viewpoint is that the viewer sees the intro sequence from the viewpoint of a flying dragon, and this is the dragon blinking. Is there any evidence to support any valid conclusions?</p>

<p><sub>I apologize if this answer later becomes obvious. My knowledge is quite limited: I have only just begun watching the TV series (near the end of season one), and I have not read the books.</sub></p>
","<game-of-thrones>","52959","<p>No, it's nothing mythological, but merely a retro-tech gimmick in tune with the steam punk style of the intro:</p>

<p>The visual effect simulates the changing between lenses of different focal lengths using a turret, which was used up until the 1960s or so, when zoom lenses were developed. Of course, back then the lens change would usually be edited out.</p>

<p>Alas, the mother of dragons cannot see people in chains, so she decides to put an unreasonable ultimatum so she will destroy Yunkai.</p>

<p>The ambassador, in return, says that they have friends who will put her army to death with great pleasure. After he leaves, Daenerys speaks with Ser Mormont about these ""friends"". She asks who they might be, and he says that he doesn't know. Her reply is for him to find out.</p>

<p>How? How would he find out? Would he knock on the city doors and ask people who are the mercenaries kept on retainer by the city leaders? Will he take out his smartphone and search on Google (I bet there's reasonable reception nearby such a glorious city)? Or in a classic Mel Brooks moment, he'll take out the script and search for the answer in the script?</p>

<p>Okay, all the above are fairly preposterous. But it serves to illustrate the point. It doesn't seem reasonable that he can ""find out"" in any way that doesn't involve engaging in war with the mercenaries to begin with...</p>

<p>Can anyone give a plausible explanation as to how he found out the answer without resorting to the above options?</p>

  <strong><em>Ser Jorah:</em></strong> Only by the broken sword on their banners (*). They're called the Second Sons. They're lead by a bravoosi named Mero -- the Titan's Bastard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(*) Confirmed on the wiki: The banner of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Second_Sons"">the Second Sons</a> is a broken sword.</p>

<p>So that is the answer in the TV-show, clearly: They find out in the next episode when Ser Jorah recognizes them. Back when Daenerys first asked Ser Jorah, there was no one there but the emissary from Yunkai, so he could not see them to recognize them.</p>

<p>Ser Jorah has spent a long time in Essos, selling his sword and travelling. He has lots of knowledge about Essos culture and factions. This is known from very early in the books, when we get to know Ser Jorah's tragic history. But I do not believe it is until <em>A Dance with Dragons</em> that we hear that he was once riding with the Second Sons. </p>

<p>I do not have a relevant quote to prove it, and I do not believe there is a good, short quote, but it is clearly described in <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jorah"">Jorah's wiki page</a>. It was more of a thing of Ser Jorah and the captains recognizing each other.</p>

<p>To be clear, just because Ser Jorah's affiliation with the Second Sons is in the books does not mean it should be in the TV-show, and Ser Jorah never lied to Dany about it in the books.</p>

<p>One plausible counter argument you could make, is that fire didn't destroy the wall, but rather the magic of the Dragon Fire and/or Night King himself. The wall was created by magic (the details are uncertain), and you could argue it takes magic to destroy magic.</p>

<p>Why did she not inform Tywin of this illicit relationship?</p>

<p>Is it because, she felt the same mistakes she committed with her brother are now committed by Jaime and Cersei or due to the fear that Tywin might harm the children? Also, she dies when Jaime and Cersei were only 9. I do not understand how they could have engaged in some sexual activity at such an early age. </p>
","<game-of-thrones>","54365","<p>First things first. Are the Lannister kids born out of incest? </p>

<p>Quite assuredly no. Sure Joanna Lannister had a brother, but so do 90% of the noblewomen of Westeros. And Stafford Lannister has been described (in the books) as oafish, so not exactly the dashing Jaime Lannister.</p>

<p>Now back to the question itself.</p>

<p>Since we have no POV chapters for Tywin and no flashbacks of Joanna we are left to speculate. Most probably Joanna thought only to protect her children. Incest is a grave sin in Westeros, and if word got out the repercussions would be huge. It is not uncommon for mothers to abstain from telling fathers about their children's wrong doings. For if Tywin found out, chances are he would punish them severely. This is a man who did horrible things to his son Tyrion because of his whoring and other (in Tywin's eyes) crimes. So probably Joanna attempted to hush it up and not expose them. We do know from the books that the two were separated by their mother soon afterwards.</p>

"54409","Why does Janos Slynt hold such a high position in the Night's Watch?","<p>In <em>A Storm of Swords</em>, after Jon returns from his wildling adventure, Janos Slynt sits in judgment over him and has him thrown into an ice cell.</p>

<p>Is there an in-universe explanation of why</p>

<ul>
<li>such a recent arrival to the Night's Watch is in such a high position of power (apparently quite at the top of the chain of command) and why</li>
<li>he can still insist on being addressed as ""Lord of Harrenhal"", although men of the Night's Watch ""<em>hold no lands</em>""?</li>
</ul>

<p>(The explanation in the TV show makes sense: Alliser Thorne is ""acting Lord Commander"", so he can just declare that his buddy has a seat on the panel that decides Jon's fate. I don't remember him being ""acting Lord Commander"" in the books, though.)</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","54417","<p>His insisting on claiming his supposed title is nothing more than meaningless posturing on his part, as he <em>wasn't</em> Lord of Harrenhal anymore by the time he arrived at The Wall. He was stripped of that title by Tyrion, and Harrenhal was subsequently given to Littlefinger.</p>

<p>As far as his influence on the wall, I don't think it's even made explicit, but there are a number of things that Slynt has going for him over your average raw recruit:</p>

<ul>
<li>He was a former Commander of the City Watch (the Goldcloaks), and Lord of Harrenhal, so he would probably get a higher starting position. Remember our very first scene in <em>A Game of Thrones</em> has a former nobleman, now in the Night's Watch, outranking a clearly more experienced and qualified Night's Watchman (before getting Other'd to death).</li>
<li>He rapidly allies himself with existing ranking members of the Watch, like Thorne. By accusing someone that many of the brothers already disliked, he earned their allegiance; and 90% of getting a position of power is simply having other people accept that you deserve that power.</li>
<li>He has the explicit backing of the Lannisters, both Tywin (who's filthy rich) and Joffrey (who, by that point, had basically won the war.) Again, that makes it likely that other ranking Watch officers would follow his lead, in hopes of earning favor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, a subsequent events will ultimately demonstrate, he has no <em>official</em> authority in the Night's Watch, only that he can derive from his high-powered friends:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> He gets no support from Stannis nor most of the Watch when he makes a play for Lord Commander, and ultimately, Jon tries to send him away. With Tywin no longer alive to support Slyn, Jon simply executes him for insubordiation when he refuses.</p>

"54507","How big of a deal is Westeros?","<p>Of course, Westeros is the main stage for A Song of Ice and Fire, but how important is it at a planetary scope?</p>

<p>There is a lot of civilization beyond the Narrow Sea and, especially around the Narrow Sea, most of it is very evolved in terms of society and economy. Also the Dothraki may live a very wildling-ish life, but they appear neither afraid of nor foreign to higher cultures. There are also the Wildlings north of the wall, which also seems to be a large civilization.</p>

<p>So how important is Westeros to the entire planet? Are they a few among many or are they the most sophisticated society on that planet and take a rather leading role?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>More information I found</strong></p>

<p>I re-watched the TV show and did a little army counting on the side. The numbers don't feel mathematically sound, but maybe the Westerosi are very good at accounting for losses in most recent battles, while I'm not. Give or take a few garrisons, all of Westeros has (had) about 300K soldiers. If I had to guess I'd say that's a little more than the Wildlings and all of Essos put together, but I can't find solid numbers on those. So, measuring in military size and assuming there aren't any other big inhabited continents we don't know of, Westeros is about half the world. I'm still having trouble gauging the size of Essos.</p>

<p>In Yunkai alone, there are about 200K slaves (according to TV show S3E7). This allows for speculation that Yunkai alone has a population somewhere between 200K and 1M people. If Yunkai does not greatly outsize all other Free Cities, Essos probably has a much larger population than Westeros. Kings Landing has a population of 500k.</p>

<p><strong>Even more information I found</strong></p>

<p>Just reading A Storm of Swords and it would appear Mereen, Yunkai and Astapor are not of the nine Free Cities. IIRC, I got this impression from the Daenerys chapter where she talks to Kraznys mo Nakloz for the first time.
Comparing impressions from reading the books vs. the TV series, according to the book there are way more Dothraki and other tribes/people living on that side of the narrow sea. So in terms of population I would reduce my guess, making Westeros about one third of the known world.</p>

<p>In terms of society and technology I also wouldn't call Westeros leading. Their beliefs and knowledge seem to have devolved over time. There are the new gods and people somehow accept there are old gods as well. Everything else is little more than folly, if at all. The Maesters can choose to study magic but few do and none can actually perform magic. The alchemists seem a pathetic guild of engineers. Nobody believes there are things like mammoths, giants, skinchangers and such. The remaining acknowledged supernatural thing are the Children of the Forest, but even here everybody knows there aren't any left anywhere.</p>

<p>In Essos, many beliefs are practiced, but people are hardly judged by that. Maegi are more than tales and everything that may seem impossible/unrealistic can be done by at least one person from Asshai. If not, you will still find at least one person who will claim they once met someone from Asshai who could. The Warlocks in Qarth live more ore less openly among other people. In general, the Free Cities appear bigger not only in population and size but also the architecture, than any dwelling in Westeros. All of Essos seems well arranged, even settled, while all of Westeros goes to war whenever a highborn firstborn hits puberty.</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><game-of-thrones>","54511","<p>I think it's important to understand the planet, and how much is known. Currently there are 4 known continents of the known world: <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Westeros"">Westeros,</a> <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Essos"">Essos,</a> <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Sothoryos"">Sothoryos,</a> and <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ulthos"">Ulthos.</a> We should remember that civilisation in the known world is currently at a state where there are many parts of the world still uncharted. It is entirely possible that there are more continents that are not known. Consider the late discovery of the Americas, and the even later discovery of Australia, by Eurasian civilisation.</p>

<p>Further to this, we don't even know a significant amount about the four continents. Little is known about Sothoryos, and almost nothing is known about Ulthos. Even the two continents that are known, Westeros and Essos, are not fully charted. No complete map of Essos exists, and the polar regions to the far north of Westeros, way beyond the Wall are still unexplored. However, these lands are unlikely to contain any great civilisation, if life at all, so we can consider the knowledge to be sufficient.</p>

<p>So this means that any answer can only truly be based on a comparison between Westeros and Essos.</p>

<p>The main difference between Westeros and Essos is that the former is united as The Seven Kingdoms (clearly the civil wars in A Song of Ice and Fire throw this into question, but lets look at this from the start of the series). With the exception of a few raids from the wildlings, a few pirates along the narrow sea, and bandits roaming the kingdom, Westeros has enjoyed relative peace. This has allowed their civilisation to prosper. Lords are free to devote resources to keeping roads safe, and clearing bandit raids, allowing smaller villages and farmsteads to enjoy a safer life.</p>

<p>Essos consists of many different peoples. A few of the most significant are the Dothraki, the Free Cities, the Lhazareen, Qarth, and many other regions. One of the main territories was the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Valyrian_Freehold"">Valyrian Freehold.</a> Once a great, powerful and knowledgeable territory, left in ruins and all but extinct since the Doom of Valyria.</p>

<p>As Essos is not united, the internal fighting, and the threat of the fierce Dothraki, has shaped the continent into a very different civilisation to Westeros. Rather than many villages and farms surrounding a Lord's castle, as is the case with Westeros, much of the Essos civilisation consists of huge, fruitful cities, with high walls and little outside. An obvious example of this is Qarth. An impressive port city, booming on trade, but surrounded by nothing but wasteland. The reason for this sort of growth, is that smaller villages struggle to withstand the Dothraki. The Lhazareen are constantly under attack from the Dothraki, and the Kingdom of Sarnor has been left in ruins from Dothraki attack. Therefore the best option for civilisation in Essos is a concentrated city, near the sea, allowing them to amass a large, single army to defend them, surrounded by high city walls.</p>

<p>It's hard to compare different civilisations in this world, as it is not a global world such as our own. Westeros is quite insular, but is clearly a significant land mass and civilisation within the known world. I'll try and find canon examples of mentions of Westeros' significance, but hopefully this will provide you with enough information.</p>

"54659","What virtue prolonged Robert Baratheon's sovereignty?","<p>Kings Landing is rendered as a veritable pit of Vipers, with each component constantly forwarding their own ambitions through murder and subterfuge. This is especially true of people of power: Advisors, Dignitaries, Challengers from other Royal Households.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uwi3K.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Whilst I'm aware that the death of Robert Baratheon served as a catalyst for the events of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, was Kings Landing a considerably more hospitable place in support of a King's longevity <em>before</em> Baratheon's death, or was there some capability/factor that Robert possessed that meant he was able to reign unopposed for so long, and managed what seems to be an impossible feat: a sovereignty that didn't result in him being deposed/murdered?</p>

<p>The entire series is an exploration of Statecraft, with different elements pursuing different strategies in order to consolidate power within their own reach. Is this a behavior that truly only emerged at the death of Robert, or did Baratheon suffer the same incessant duplicity and scheming from his subjects?</p>

<h2>What advantage did Robert have, that he was able to propser for so long?</h2>

<p>A conversation between Tywin and Tommen in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaker_of_Chains"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Breaker of Chains</a> would suggest that Robert's legacy lay in his 'Strength', which ultimately proved to be his downfall. </p>

<p>It's unlikely this is a reference to his physical constitution, so is there some further diplomatic factor attributed to Robert's longevity? If so, what is it?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","54668","<p>You have to start a little earlier. The catalyst for the events of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> was not the death of Robert, but the death of Jon Arryn.  Jon Arryn fostered both Robert and Ned Stark and was very much like a father to both of them. After Robert became king, Jon Arryn became the Hand of the King and a <em>de facto</em> ruler of the Seven Kingdoms.</p>

<p>Robert was a good fighter, and he also had personal charisma, which allowed him to turn many of his enemies into friends.  However, he was completely inept as a peace-time ruler, and it was Jon Arryn who kept the kingdom together. This is why immediately after Jon Arryn's death, Robert set out for Winterfell to tell Ned to be his new Hand. Robert wanted nothing to do with the day-to-day business of running a kingdom, and he desperately needed a replacement for Jon Arryn. Unfortunately, it turned out that Ned Stark was far less qualified than his mentor, which is one of the causes of the War of Five Kings.</p>

<p>So, the answer to your main question about what made Robert so unique is Jon Arryn, who was a very shrewd politician. He was able to deal with the snake pit that is Kings Landing, and keep all the great houses in line for 15 years. All Robert could do by himself was bankrupt his realm.</p>

"54878","What is the bank system in Game of Thrones and why is it legitimate to exist?","<p>Right now, I am in the beginning of the season 4. I haven't read the books themselves, but I understand that the series is pretty close to the original content.</p>

<p>What makes me curious is the financial system of the Seven Kingdoms. Here and there some unclear bankers are mentioned, those who actually support with gold all the rulers of the Seven Kingdoms. Do the books ever explain any of this in detail? When did this bank system came to reality, who made it legal, and why do the kingdoms tend to loan money from them?</p>

<p>It's actually not some natural institution. For example, in many real medieval kingdoms usury and interest were against the law. Was it true for the Seven Kingdoms in the past? If so, when did this change? It seems to me that the bankers actually are the main financiers of the war, since it brings them huge profits. But do bankers make any actual appearance in the books?</p>

<p>Since I was asked to be more specific about my questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Who produces the currency of the Seven Kingdoms? It's definitely not the Master of Coin, considering what I saw.</li>
<li>Is the currency centralized at all in Seven Kingdoms, or does each kingdom have its own currency?</li>
<li>Why do the kings prefer to borrow money from some bankers (i.e. to borrow from each other, since the bankers don't have any money of their own from the start) instead of getting rid of the bankers once and for all and issue their own coins?</li>
</ul>

<p>Bronn in season 2 put it out perfectly in his dialog with the Imp:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Why don't we just get rid of the bankers instead of paying them?</p>
</blockquote>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><money>","54880","<p>Bankers do make an appearance in the book. The main bank in ASoIaF is the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Iron_Bank_of_Braavos"">Iron Bank of Braavos</a> All of the free cities have their own banks, but the Iron Bank is by far the most powerful. It is considered highly foolish to trifle with the Iron Bank, where it is often said, <em>""The Iron Bank will have its due.""</em> If necessary, the Iron Bank will use its vast wealth to hire sell swords to get its money back, and has the power to support new Kings, thus changing the shape of the lands.</p>

<p><em>Spoilered appearances for each book.</em></p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">

The Iron bank intends to support Stannis, on the promise that he will pay the debts that the Iron Throne owes the bank. <em>The Iron Bank will have its due.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We also hear that</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>Ser Harys Swyft, the Master of Coin under Lord Regent Kevan Lannister, has written to the banks of both Pentos and Myr, to try and raise enough money to pay back the loans of the Iron bank. This clearly suggests that the Iron Bank is so powerful that it's worth taking another loan in order to placate them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clearly banking is a very important part of the Known World. However we only hear of banks from the Free Cities of Essos. We do hear of other sources of loans. We learn that the Iron Throne is in a large debt to Tywin Lannister. It does not make clear the terms of the loan, but it is unlikely that Tywin will lend money without the potential for gain, whether through interest paid or promise of power.</p>

<p><strong><em>Update based on the  revised question</em></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Who produces the currency of the 7 kingdoms? It's definitely not the Master of Coin, considering what I saw.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don't believe there's any mention of this, I'll continue looking.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is the currency centralized at all in Seven Kingdoms, or does each kingdom have its own currency?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a single unified currency throughout the seven Kingdoms. This consists of three coins: the Gold Dragon, The Silver Stag, and the Copper Star (7-pointed, representing the Gods). This was established after the unification of the Seven Kingdoms, following the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/War_of_Conquest"">War of Conquest</a>.</p>

<p>There is some slight exception to this, regarding the Iron Islands. The Iron Born (particularly the men) tend not to use money as much (“the Gold price”) and prefer only to trade the things which they took by force (“the Iron price”).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why do the kings prefer to borrow money from some bankers (i.e. to borrow from each other, since the bankers don't have any money of their own from the start) instead of getting rid of the bankers once and for all and issue their own coins?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a very complicated question, and you could ask the same of our world. If you start to dismantle the financial institutions, then you start to create many enemies. Banks have their money and power stored in many ways, and once you try taking apart one piece, the others will find retribution. It is mentioned that the Iron Bank of Braavos will be willing to incur losses, and hire sell swords to get their money back. It's all about reputation. If you believe that a bank will come back with swift retribution, then you might prefer to pay them.</p>

<p>There's also an issue with revolt. Once you start dismantling your own laws, regulations and institutions, this leads to anarchy. For a real world comparison, consider the revolts and rebellions surrounding <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_II_of_England#Conflict_with_Parliament"">Charles II</a> reign and his actions of dissolving parliament.</p>

"54936","Is the White Walker/Other that Samwell Tarly encounters of importance(high-rank)?","<p>My friends and I were conversing on Team Speak we all came upon this question.  Is it even mentioned in the books?  I know that he was important in the way of knowing White Walkers can be slain, but I am asking if he was of high-rank, or if he was known in a behind the scenes plot of something bigger in say, the current book?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","54944","<p>There's no canon explaining White Walkers, whether they have a society, how it functions etc. The only things we know are things that we've seen, such as that they turn dead humans into <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Wights"" rel=""nofollow"">Wights</a>, and they can be harmed by <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragonglass"" rel=""nofollow"">Dragonglass/Obsidian</a>, and by Valyrian steel. Anything else is just rumours and stories by people in Westeros, such as Old Nan.</p>

<p>According to Melissandre, the White Walkers worship a god known as the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Great_Other"" rel=""nofollow"">Great Other</a>. The only source for this is Melisandre, so it's certainly not given as fact. However considering the things we've witnessed from her (and Thoros/Dondarrion), and the fact that the series is titled A Song of Ice and Fire, I'm inclined to believe that she is correct. So assuming that she is, this would suggest that the White Walkers do have some sort of society, so there may be some form of hierarchy amongst them. As to whether or not the White Walker in question is of importance, that's impossible to say.</p>

<p><strong>So in short, no we don't know anything about White Walker society and hierarchy; so we don't know whether the one in question was considered important.</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Update based on season 4, episode 4</em></strong></p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>In this episode, something is revealed that isn't yet written in the books. Baby boys (human) are turned into White Walkers by an unknown White Walker, who is believe to be the <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Night&#39;s_King"" rel=""nofollow"">Night's King</a> due to a <a href=""http://io9.com/this-accidental-game-of-thrones-spoiler-just-changed-1568796246"" rel=""nofollow"">possible spoiler from HBO</a>. There's a number of things we can glean from this, which should give us more information.
<br>
<br>Firstly (assuming that the HBO spoiler is correct) we now know that the White Walkers have a king, and therefore a hierarchy. Whilst we still can't be certain, we can draw parallels between them and us. Considering that the White Walker that encountered Samwell Tarly was alone, when enemies were nearby, then we can assume that it wasn't high ranking. A King, Lord, General or other does not go out scouting alone. So it's likely that this particular White Walker was a scout, or something like a soldier (or perhaps even operating alone; we don't yet know if the White Walkers are all unified).
<br>
<br>However if all White Walkers come from human babies, then it stands to reason that there numbers won't be very large (this also makes sense with why they haven't been more brazen with their attacks; and why they convert wights). So in this regard, I'd say all White Walkers are important to them, as they don't have sufficient population numbers to afford to lose many.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So to summarise my hypothesis, I'd say that they are important due to their low population size, but not high-ranking within their hierarchy/society; probably a scout or something similar.</p>

"54986","Does Melisandre really worship R'hllor, or does she merely use that belief?","<p>As far as I know, there once was magic in Westeros, just as there once were dragons. For example the Wall is said to be built with the help of magic. I don't recall anybody sneering about it, but I get the picture that people ""know"" and ""acknowledge"" there once was magic.</p>

<p>When Stannis releases the Onion Knight they discuss the things they witnessed and Stannis concludes that the Lord of Light must be real. At least in the TV show, the discussion is concluded with a (probably rhetorical) question how all this can be if the Lord of Light wasn't real. I find it rather strange that people never even suggest the return of magic. (Especially after they seem to have established a very peaceful co-existence of monotheistic and polytheistic beliefs, but I'm straying ...)
With everything I think I know, I'd rather say with the ""church"" of the Lord of Light magic finds its way back into the world.</p>

<p>When Thoros of Myr told Melisandre, that the Lord of Light had brought back Beric Dondarrion from the dead 6 times, she was startled and said: ""you shouldn't have that power"". The interesting thing is, that for the half drunk Thoros, it is crystal clear, that he merely prayed and the Lord of Light did the work. Still, Melisandre seems to know that resurrection is something the priest does/did. To me it's clear, that she is more into everything concerning the Lord of Light than Thoros has ever been.</p>

<p>Could it be, that Melisandre is actually a witch who is very aware of it and the nature of her powers and merely uses the religion of the Lord of Light to train, explain and (re-)establish magic in the world, but doesn't actually believe in R'hllor?</p>
","<a-song-of-ice-and-fire><game-of-thrones><religion>","54992","<p>Firstly, let's address the ""witch"" issue. Melisandre certainly does wield magic. Her power is not just given from R'hllor, it's something she studied (along with all of the other Red Priests). Their belief is that the magic comes from R'hllor, as a gift to them, but they must still learn to wield it. So, depending on your definition, she is a ""witch"", whether she believes in R'hllor or not.</p>

<p>Why did she seem surprised that Thoros brought back Beric Dondarrion? Well Thoros was never particular pious, so he wouldn't have received many powers from R'hllor. This doesn't really bring her faith in R'hllor into question, just her faith in Thoros, which is understandable given his past.</p>

<p>What does suggest that she may just be a witch? We know that Melisandre is a <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Shadowbinder"">Shadowbinder</a>. We don't know much about them but the name would suggest that the power of creating a shadow comes from her other magic, not from R'hllor. Melisandre claims that these shadows are servants of light. Whether she believes this or not, is impossible to say.</p>

<p><strong>There's nothing in the books to suggest she doesn't believe in R'hllor, so any answer to the contrary can only be hypothesis and theory.</strong></p>

  <p>Stannis isn't the chosen one of R'hllor. There's evidence to support this. It's fairly well established that his sword isn't actually <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lightbringer"">Lightbringer</a>. Salador Saan says to Davos, ""that sword was not Lightbringer, my friend"", and Maester Aemon says to Samwell, ""The sword is wrong, she has to know that ... light without heat ... an empty glamour ... the sword is wrong, and the false light can only lead us deeper into darkness."" Lightbringer is said to be a sword made of living fire. The only time we've seen this is with Lord Beric Dondarrion, who has a sword that can become engulfed in flames. Couple this with the fact that Thoros keeps bringing him back to life, and I believe that the Lord Beric is the true chosen one of R'hllor. This would explain why Melisandre was so shocked. It didn't make her question her faith in R'hllor, it made her question her faith in Stannis.</p>

<p>It was the first time I had ever thought about ""shadows"" being part of the light/good side. </p>

<p>From the Wikipedia article on Zoroastrianism we can draw parallels to R'hollor.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Zoroastrianism, water (apo, aban) and <strong>fire</strong> (atar, azar) are <strong>agents of ritual purity</strong>, and the associated purification ceremonies are considered the basis of ritual life. In Zoroastrian cosmogony, water and fire are respectively the second and last primordial elements to have been created, and scripture considers fire to have its origin in the waters. <strong>Both water and fire are considered life-sustaining</strong>, and both water and fire are represented within the precinct of a fire temple. <strong>Zoroastrians usually pray in the presence of some form of fire</strong> (which can be considered evident in any source of light), and the culminating rite of the principle act of worship constitutes a ""strengthening of the waters"". <strong>Fire is considered a medium through which spiritual insight and wisdom is gained</strong>, and water is considered the source of that wisdom.</p>

"189126","Which Wonders and Wonders Made by Man has Tyrion visited?","<p>From <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/183358/58193"">my answer</a> to the related question: <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/65972/58193"">What are the Wonders and the Wonders Made by Man?</a> we see what the Wonders and Wonders Made by Man are/possibly are. From the quotes on the Q/A we can clearly see Tyrion is highly intrigued by them and would like to see them all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A scribe, long dead,&quot; said Haldon. &quot;He spent his life traveling the world and writing about the lands he visited in two books he called Wonders and Wonders Made by Man.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;An uncle of mine gave them to me when I was just a boy,&quot; said Tyrion. <strong>&quot;I read them until they fell to pieces.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>&quot;The gods made seven wonders, and mortal man made nine,&quot; quoted the Halfmaester. &quot;Rather impious of mortal man to do the gods two better, but there you are. The stone roads of Valyria were one of Longstrider's nine. The fifth, I believe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The fourth,&quot; said Tyrion, <strong>who had committed all sixteen of the wonders to memory as a boy.</strong> His uncle Gerion liked to set him on the table during feasts and make him recite them. I liked that well enough, didn't I? Standing there amongst the trenchers with every eye upon me, proving what a clever little imp I was. <strong>For years afterward, he had cherished a dream that one day he would travel the world and see Longstrider's wonders for himself.</strong></p>
<p>Lord Tywin had put an end to that hope ten days before his dwarf son's sixteenth nameday, when Tyrion asked to tour the Nine Free Cities, as his uncles had done at that same age.</p>
<p><sup>A Dance with Dragons, Tyrion III</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the same passage we can see that he has seen the Valyrian roads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Come moonrise, they were back in their saddles, trotting eastward under a mantle of stars. The old Valyrian road glimmered ahead of them like a long silver ribbon winding through wood and dale. For a little while Tyrion Lannister felt almost at peace. &quot;Lomas Longstrider told it true. The road's a wonder.&quot;</p>
<p><sup>ibid</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We also know he has <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/3577/58193"">visited the Wall</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The largest structure ever built by the hands of man, Benjen Stark had told Jon on the kingsroad when they had first caught sight of the Wall in the distance. &quot;And beyond a doubt the most useless,&quot; Tyrion Lannister had added with a grin, but even the Imp grew silent as they rode closer. You could see it from miles off, a pale blue line across the northern horizon, stretching away to the east and west and vanishing in the far distance, immense and unbroken. This is the end of the world, it seemed to say.</p>
<p><sup>A Game of Thrones, Jon III</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, I'm not sure what other Wonders he has seen/been too. He even actively turned down going to Qarth to see the walls.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We could sail to Qarth,&quot; Penny went on. &quot;The streets are paved with jade there, my brother always said. The city walls are one of the wonders of the world. When we perform in Qarth, gold and silver will rain down on us, you'll see.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Some of those ships out on the bay are Qartheen,&quot; Tyrion reminded her. &quot;Lomas Longstrider saw the walls of Qarth. His books suffice for me. I have gone as far east as I intend to go.&quot;</p>
<p><sup>A Dance with Dragons, Tyrion XI</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, that doesn't mean he doesn't want to see the rest of the Wonders still. Do we know what other Wonders/Wonders Made by Man Tyrion has visited?</p>

The road was just wide enough for two carts to pass abreast, so whenever a wagon headed west passed one going east, both had to slow to a crawl.<br />

They passed a marble stair that spiraled up from the mud and ended jaggedly in air. Beyond, half-seen, were other shapes: shattered spires, headless statues, trees with roots bigger than their boat.</p>

"55201","Craster's last son [spoilers]","<p>In Oathkeeper (Season 4 Episode 4): </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> We see Craster's last son, an infant, sacrificed to the others (white walkers). 
 A white walker takes the infant, places him on a pedestal, then touches his face. The infants eye's then turn completely blue. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We know that...</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Wights have completely blue eyes and are the reanimated corpses of humans and animals. But the white walkers themselves also have completely blue eyes and appear to be living beings, but not human. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So my question is this:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Was the infant killed and turned into a wight? Or was the infant turned into a white walker? </p>
</blockquote>
","<game-of-thrones>","55219","<p>It would be kind of an anti-climax if the infant just became a wight, after all that build-up. Any dead thing becomes a wight, so this long ride, the ice pedestal and ceremony would be overkill if all they meant to do was create a wight. So this is clearly something more.</p>

<p>I think this is the TV-show fleshing out the story from the books where it is merely implied that Craster and his sons have something to do with the Others (the White Walkers). I think the most clear hint in the books is the scene where Sam and Gilly are fleeing from Craster's, after the rogue Night's Watch men kill him and the Old Bear:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gilly was crying. “Me and the babe. Please. I’ll be your wife, like I
  was Craster’s. please, ser crow. He’s a boy, just like Nella said he’d
  be. If you don’t take him, they will.”</p>
  
  <p>“They?” said Sam, and the raven cocked its black head and echoed,
  “They They They”</p>
  
  <p>“The boy’s brothers,” said the old woman on the left. “Craster’s sons.
  The white cold’s rising out there, crow. I can feel it in my bones.
  These poor old bones don’t lie. They’ll be here soon, the sons.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This implies that Craster's sons are somehow turned into White Walkers. Which also presumably is why Craster and Craster's Keep is not attacked by the White Walkers or Wights. I believe Craster says something to the effect that he is a godly man, and does not need to worry about wights. </p>

<p>Who blows the horn three times announcing the White Walkers? They are at the Fist of the First Men, beyond the wall, so it could’t have been the Night’s Watch. One thought I had it was that that there could have been a sentinel, but again they are in wildlings’ territory and I think they could’t have a sentinel there (not safe) and also they are unaware of the wildlings whereabouts (that’s why the party went beyond the wall), which indicates they don’t  have sentinels beyond the wall.</p>

<p>And I was under the impression that the White Walkers army was marching on the Wall. If so, why didn’t they reached the wall yet (in the tv series)? Even if they weren’t marching on the Wall, Sam did see them, yet the Night’s Watch doesn’t seem to be very concern with them.</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","55229","<p>The horn is blown by the night's watch, and yes they have sentries hidden around their camp.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Travel: late 14c., ""to journey,"" from travailen (1300) ""to make a
  journey,"" <strong>originally ""to toil, labor""</strong> (see <strong>travail</strong>). The semantic
  development may have been via the notion of ""go on a difficult
  journey,"" but it also <strong>may reflect the difficulty of any journey in the
  Middle Ages</strong>. Replaced Old English faran. Related: Traveled; traveling.
  Traveled (adj.) ""having made journeys, experienced in travel"" is from
  early 15c. Traveling salesman is attested from 1885.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our concept of travel is very modern, and recent. Even in the 19th century when travel by train was possible, still most of the population didn't travel without good reason. The main reason for this was travelling was <em>really</em> expensive. Firstly you'd have to pay to get where you were going, then you'd have to pay for accommodation when you got there. 
Travel was only realistically possible for the rich.</p>

<p>Roll back to medieval times, adding to the expense you've danger. If you couldn't pay for armed guards you're at the mercy of everyone you meet on the road. You've to either pay for food and lodging or forage and camp as you go, which effectively halves your daily distance &amp; doubles your travel time. In medieval times it was completely the norm for people to be born, live and die of old age without ever venturing more than 10 or so miles from their home.</p>

<p>Given, in the west, how quickly we can travel from one side of the country to the other, and even travelling to the other side of the world is possible, it does seem unreasonable that people didn't move or travel, but it's only because we're looking through our ""affluent western reality filters"". If you go to parts of the developing world, you'll find people who ""don't travel"" and would be slightly bemused at the idea.</p>

<p>Consider, 40 or 50 years ago, lots of people left my country (Ireland) to find work abroad. People who were leaving for America, Canada &amp; Australia were often ""Waked"" (as in a funeral/celebration of their life). Yes it was a party, but the concept of ""wake"" was added because it was understood that those people would never return. While parents/siblings would receive letters, their wider family and acquaintances would never see or hear from them again, and it was like they'd ""died"".</p>

<p>We are incredibly lucky to live in this age of easy travel, it's only been around for 40 or so years. Roll back to the 18th century (introduction of rail travel) and before and try to imagine how difficult it was to get from Warsaw to London, through - for the time - heavily populated areas, over difficult, badly maintained roads, expensive coaches, dangerous sea crossings ... Contrast that with London to San Francisco, weeks long sea voyages, then wagon train across hostile country that could take months.</p>

<p>Also, the books give a better impression of distances travelled and the time spent on the roads and in the wilds. The travellers are knights or travel with guards, and are less worried than most about bandits. They are mostly landed gentry with money or have liege lords to give them travelling expenses.</p>

Specifically, this could refer to the events of <em>ADWD</em>, and the Prince of Dorne's decision to send his son to Daenerys, to attempt to organise a marriage pact with Daenerys against the Lannisters (the sun ""rising"" against the crown in the west); and the subsequent death of Quentyn Martell at the hands of Daenerys' dragons (the sun (sun's son) ""setting"" in the east).

<p>It is evident that dragonglass can destroy White Walkers and the First Men had a lot of dragon glass.</p>

<p>Why would they banish them to the Lands of Always Winter and build the Wall to prevent them from coming back and then HOPE that they didn't return rather than just kill them off to ENSURE they never returned?   </p>

The legends state the Battle for the Dawn was the last battle between the First Men and the Children of the Forest versus the Others. During this battle the Others lost and were sent fleeing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How the Long Night came to an end is a matter of legend, as all such matters of the distant past have become. In the North, they tell of a last hero who sought out the intercession of the children of the forest, his companions abandoning him or dying one by one as they faced ravenous giants, cold servants, and the Others themselves. Alone he finally reached the children, despite the efforts of the white walkers, and all the tales agree this was a turning point. Thanks to the children, the first men of the Night's Watch banded together and were able to fight—and win—the Battle for the Dawn: the last battle that broke the endless winter and sent the Others fleeing to the icy north. Now, six thousand years later (or eight thousand as True History puts forward), the Wall made to defend the realms of men is still manned by the sworn brothers of the Night's Watch, and neither the Others nor the children have been seen in many centuries.</p>

<p>That's not to say they didn't try and kill all of the Others and their wight army but it's hard to always be 100% sure. And when you're against an army as strong as the Others and wights it's best to have a backup plan, in this case that plan was the Wall and the Night's Watch.</p>
<p>It's also worth pointing out that we don't really know much about the Others and so by extension the people of Westeros likely don't know much about them either. If you don't know much about them, you don't know where they come from and so you don't know how many of them there actually are. Though they were pushed back way into the North and that is an extremely large place - The Lands of Always Winter.</p>

  <p>Stannis pointed North ""There is where I'll find the foe I was born to fight"" <br><sub>p483 A Storm of Swords, 2:Blood and Gold</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stannis also had other reasons for going to defend Castle Black</p>

<ol>
<li>He wanted Jon to take Winterfell so that he would have a foothold in the North, the largest region in the kingdom. This enabled him to continue his fight beyond the wall while having someone he trusted as Lord of Winterfell.</li>
<li>By claiming the North it gave Stannis more legitimacy as he seen it. It also gave him access to valuable resources which he badly needed, especially more men.</li>
<li>Melisandre who also directed Stannis' thoughts and actions so she would've also persuaded him that he needed to go to Castle Black to defend it against the 
<em>God of Night and Terror</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>As to why the other professed ""Kings"" or Wardens didn't send anyone to help Castle Black can be explained as Broklynite states, that they were still fighting and if they weren't fighting then we were trying to rebuild. Everykingdom apart from Dorne had been involved in someway or another in the War of the Five Kings. So they needed to recoup their losses, rebuild their towns, castles and tend to their people and lands. Their armies would also have been short of men, therefore instead of sending men to Castle Black to help them, they needed to retain whatever men they had left for their own protection. Also there's a history of some regions, especially in King's landing, of looking down upon the Night's Watch and not really giving it much consideration. As we learn from Yoren (long, long ago) he is sent to retrieve prisoners from the many dungeons in Westeros who have the offer to take the Black, and who are the very lowest and worst of society.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dragons, <strong>like a bird</strong>, tend to imprint on whoever is present when they

</blockquote>

<p>So, can Bran control dragons?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><dragons>","134415","<p>The answer would be ""No He probably can't"". We can't answer this from Show canon because show has never mentioned an encounter between Wargs and Dragons. So we have to see the history in books.</p>

<h2>Examples of Wargs encountering dragons</h2>

<p>Only example of when wargs came face to face with dragons is when King <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jaehaerys_I_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Jaehaerys I Targaryen</a> and his consort <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Alysanne_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Queen Alysanne the Good</a><sup>1</sup> flew north to help the Night's Watch and defeated a host of wildlings, wargs and giants at wall. Pictured Queen Alysanne on Silverwing at the Wall, during the campaign<sup>2</sup>:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oiRSEm.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/oiRSEm.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>No warg managed to control <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Vermithor"" rel=""noreferrer"">Vermithor</a> (Mount of Jaehaerys) or <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Silverwing"" rel=""noreferrer"">Silverwing</a> (mount of Alysanne). This is implied because if a warg had managed that, it would have been a huge event and must have been reported in chronicles of watch or some other record. </p>

<p>This would have also probably caused death of the dragon rider targeted by the warg since the logical move on part of the warg would be to make the dragon throw his/her rider off to the ground. But since nothing like this is reported, we can assume it never happened. </p>

<p>If trained and experienced wildling Wargs could not control dragons, we can assume untrained and green Bran can't either. </p>

<h2>Claiming/Controlling a dragon</h2>

<p>Still We do not know if skin changers can slip into dragons. Some may say Dragonlords of Valyria might have used some different sort of skin-changing for riding dragons because after a dragon was claimed by a rider, they both shared a bond and became aware of each other (e.g. <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dreamfyre"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dreamfyre</a> broke her chains when her rider Queen <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Helaena_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Helaena Targaryen</a> jumped from Red Keep to die). But that would be a weak argument. Bond with a dragon seems to be way different. </p>

<p>But anyhow, we know it for Blood-magic, which allowed Dragonlords to claim dragons. Everything the Valyrians accomplished is attributed to their knowledge of blood magic. </p>

<p>Dragons are not like horses, to be ridden by any man who desires. They only serve the person who is their rider e.g. Prince <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Joffrey_Velaryon"" rel=""noreferrer"">Joffrey Velaryon</a> was thrown to his death by <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Syrax"" rel=""noreferrer"">Syrax</a> who was his mother <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rhaenyra_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Rhaenyra Targaryen</a>'s mount. Aegon the Conqueror flew Balerion but he never dared to mount dragons of his sisters; Vhagar and Meraxes. No Dragon rider has ever claimed two dragons. </p>

<p>All three of Daenerys's dragons were unclaimed previously. Daenerys has now claimed Drogon so he is unlikely to allow another rider until Daenerys lives. Rhaegel and Viserion are however up for taking.</p>

<p>If Bran was trained and knew how to slip into a dragon, we don't know what would have happened. Historically, only people with Valyrian blood have ridden a dragon. But anyhow, Bran does not share a bond with the dragons unlike his wolf (Daenerys did, her dragons could feel her rage &amp; her being in danger and act accordingly). So it is unlikely he could control a dragon. But since as the new Green-seer, Bran would have more powers than most Wargs, we do not know for sure if he can or cannot control a dragon. </p>

They might or might not be related to the resurgence of magic in the world, but we at least know they predate the birth of the dragons, because we're shown an encounter with the Others in the prologue, before Daenerys' eggs hatch. I mention this because, in turn, some characters (e.g. the warlocks of Qarth) believe the return of the <em>dragons</em> brought magic to the world, but since we know the Others predate Dany's dragons, they must have been brought by a different kind of magic, if any.</p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><dragons>","56153","<h2>Real World Answer</h2>

<p>CGI at this level is <em>very</em> expensive. So rendering the dragons when they are not actively contributing to the plot would severely drain the budget. So we only ever see the dragons when we absolutely must. It's the same reason why we see so little of the Stark direwolves.</p>

<h2>TV Answer</h2>

<p>We don't know. They certainly seem pretty big during season 4, and may or may not be caged anymore during Daenerys' march. We do see them uncaged and hunting in the first episode of season 4, but we don't know if they are caged again afterwards. However it seems from the latest episode (Season 4 Episode 6):</p>

  <p> That the dragons are now uncaged and are free to roam the land.</p>

<h2>Book Answer</h2>

<p>During Daenerys' march they were always caged. However in the books they don't grow as fast as the in the TV show. Drogon, who is the largest, is described as being only as big as a dog during the attack on Astapor, so it's conceivable that they would still be caged.</p>

<li><p>In what situation does the Defendant get a right to Trial by Combat?  </p></li>

Trial by Combat option be authoritatively dismissed by the Prosecution &amp; Judges?  </p></li>
<li><p>Does the Prosecutor have a right to Trial by Combat if he/his Champion is an extraordinary Swordsman?  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Be generic as far as possible so that nobody is spoiled.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","56177","<p>A trial by combat is essentially requesting to be judged by the gods. Denying someone the request of a trial by combat is possible, but has severe political consequences, since it implies that the denier doubts the judgement of the gods. However, it seems that only highborns are permitted to request a trial by combat.</p>

<p>A Trial by Combat:</p>

<ul>
<li>May be requested at any point before or during a trial.</li>
<li>May be advised against, but even sovereign Lords and members of the Royal Family rarely even consider denying such a request outright.</li>
<li>May be fought by the parties themselves, but it is not unusual for either or both parties to choose champions to fight in their stead.</li>
<li>Ends when either party yields or is killed; or when the accuser takes back his accusation; or (presumably) when the accused declares himself guilty.</li>
</ul>

<p>Considering the religious aspect of the trial, the champion of the just cause should prevail. Denying a champion is declaring that person to be above the gods.</p>

<p>It is less grievous to deny a choice of champion if, say, the champion is unable to arrive for the trial in a reasonable amount of time, or is unfit to fight, especially if there are other champions more readily available to the accused. If the accused is a royal, the champion must be one of the Kingsguard.</p>

<p>This is prior to the events of the books/show:</p>

<p>Of course, some find loopholes. For example, Mad King Aerys proclaimed fire to be his champion when Ned Stark's father and older brother went to King's Landing to seek justice for the kidnapping of Lyanna Stark.</p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><character-motivation>","123562","<p>In <em>The World of Ice and Fire: The Untold History of Westeros</em>, it is noted that King Aerys and Tywin were close friends as boys, along with Steffon Baratheon. Being such good friends and a close confidant of Aerys, Tywin became the youngest Hand in the Seven Kingdoms at the age of 20. Through the years, as we are well aware, Aerys became paranoid and delusional, believing that his own son Rhaegar and close friends, most notably Tywin, were plotting against him. There are several reasons why Aerys believed this.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>His wife Rhaella, although giving him an heir in Rhaegar, had countless miscarriages and still births, until the later births of Viserys and Daenerys, while Tywin's wife Joanna bore him two healthy twins, Jaime and Cersei.</p>
</li>
<li><p>After being kidnapped and held captive at Duskendale by Lord Denys Darlyn, who wanted more autonomy, Aerys believed that Tywin and Rhaegar had deliberately held back in freeing him, hoping he would be killed so Rhaegar could ascend the Iron Throne.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Aerys was inherently jealous of Tywin. He hated how Tywin seemingly had everything that he didn't and at every opportunity sought to undermine and belittle him.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The greatest insult to Tywin came in 281 AC when Aerys appointed Jaime to the Kingsguard. As stated in <em>The World of Ice and Fire: The Untold History of Westeros</em>, p121</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ser Jaime was also Lord Tywin's heir, however, and carried all his hopes for the perpetuation of House Lannister, as his lordship's other son was a the malformed dwarf, Tyrion. Moreover, the Hand had been in the midst of negotiating an advantageous marriage pact for Ser Jaime when the King informed him of his choice. At a stroke, King Aerys had deprived Lord Tywin of his chosen heir and made him look foolish and false.</p>

</ol>
<p>Tywin couldn't refuse his king appointing Jaime, as this insult possibly would have cost not only him his life but caused the complete downfall of House Lannister, which is what happened to House Darklyn.

Though he blames Tyrion for his mother and despises his physical limitations, his treatment of Tyrion doesn't seem simply emotional and reactionary. </p>

<p>He's the same with Jaime and Cersei - his treatment of them is similarly to forge them into the Lannister image - it just isn't nearly as extreme.  His lesson with Shae is ""I told you not to fraternize with whores, you did, now I'll show you the consequences of your misplaced trust.""</p>

<p>Cruel lessons, but lessons nonetheless. </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> His betrothal to Sansa Stark - she's by all accounts one of the most desirable girls in Kings Landing.  Pretty, a maiden, and most importantly, the perceived heir to Winterfell. If Tywin's goal was humiliation, he could've arranged a different marriage.  But Tywin cares about Lannister appearances first and foremost, so like the arranged marriages for Cersei and attempted one for Jaime, he sought out a suitable match befitting a Lannister.  No matter what he personally thinks of Tyrion, he wouldn't do anything just to humiliate Tyrion, and by extension the Lannister family.  His actions seem to have a purpose.  </p>

Is there a religion or philosophy from the books that I am missing? I understand all the characters were made sociopaths for dramatic effect, but sociopaths don't care about promises either.</p>

<p>For example Jon Snow killed people who violated the Night Watchmen's oath, and wildlings too. The lord of the Twins killed Rob Stark for violating his promise to marry his daughter. Jaime Lannister pledges loyalty to his king, but attempts to kill kids. </p>
","<game-of-thrones>","123949","<p>Game of Thrones is set in a world of pseudo-medieval feudal states and the behaviour of the characters is based on a morality similar to that of the real European medieval period. In that era concepts of honour and loyalty, family ties and keeping ones word/oath/promise were taken much more seriously than they are today. These concepts were closely tied to to a person's social standing and so for example breaking a promise could seriously lower your social standing, and bring shame on your family.</p>

<p>Regarding the amount of killing, there are certainly some characters in GOT who would qualify as sociopaths today, but these are also characters living in a world with different morality standards from our own where death from disease, injury etc. is far more common and life is generally ""cheaper"". Killing in self defence, or defence of one's honour or family, or for more abstract concepts like ""glory"" or ""duty"" is also far more accepted. These social and moral traits are accentuated at the top level of society, which is the focus of much of GOT, where the risks and rewards and competitiveness are all that much higher. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>[Interviewer]</strong> Quick question - We have seen all of the seven kingdoms in action in one way or another except Dorne and the Vale. I am trying to get an understanding of the various strengths of the different realms. When Robb calls the Northern Banners he gathers a host of about 18 thousand men. How do Dorne and the Vale compare to this (I don't expect numbers, just general feeling)<br />
  <strong>[GRRM]</strong> I'd say these three kingdoms were roughly equal in the force they could assemble... but the north is much bigger, so it takes longer for an army to gather. And life is harsher there as well, so lords and smallfolk both need to think carefully before beating those plowshares into swords.<br />
  <strong>[Interviewer]</strong> I also gather that Highgarden is the most populated place (Renly mentions 40,000 men), with the Lannisters being next (two combined hosts in GoT seem to be about 35,000).<br />
  <strong>[GRRM]</strong> The Reach is the second largest domain (after the north), and the most populous and fertile as well. The westerlands are the richest, with all the gold and silver in those hills. Those two regions also have the greatest strength at sea, after the Iron Islands.<br />
  <strong>[Interviewer]</strong> Dragonstone appears to be the least powerful. The Riverlands and Stormlords appear to fall in the middle I imagine.<br />
  <strong>[GRRM]</strong> Dragonstone is last, agreed. The riverlands are rich and fertile and populous, but suffer from divided leadership and a lack of natural boundaries. The stormlands have lots of trees and rocks and rain.</p>

I'm fairly certain they knew he was retracing Jon Arryn's steps when it came to the incest investigation. Assassinating Ned would invite too many questions (he wasn't old like Jon Arryn) so the only way to neutralize him would be to remove the ultimate source of his authority: King Robert. Joffrey Baratheon was old enough (but not too old) to be an effective puppet ruler, and he was a Lannister in heart if not in name. Once he was installed, the could simply dismiss Ned and replace him with Tywin without much in the way of political repercussions.</p>

"191326","What title does a queen's husband get while she's sitting on the Iron Throne?","<p>Cersei is the queen and she sits on the Iron Throne, as ruler. If she tries to marry a man, let's take Euron as an example, will Euron get the title of ""King"" or will he just be treated as ""husband to the queen""?</p>

<p>If yes, what is the extent of his powers? Is it just the same level as to what Cersei had when she was still Robert's wife?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","191327","<h1>King Consort</h1>

<p>would be the title of a man who married a ruling Queen. Although it's unclear what powers they would have in Westeros, parts of the texts suggest that it would be the Queen who ruled and the King Consort would be simply that, a consort. We can look at the first Queen of Westeros, Rhaenyra, to explore the outcome.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Long before any man had reason to doubt her innocence, the question of selecting a suitable consort for Rhaenyra had been of concern to King Viserys and his council. Great lords and dashing knights fluttered around her like moths around a flame, vying for her favor.<br>
  <sub>Princess and the Queen</sub></p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p>One of the chief pillars of support for Rhaenyra’s claim was her consort, yet Prince Daemon represented one of her greatest weaknesses as well. The prince had made more foes than friends during the course of his adventures.<br>
  <sub>ibid.</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, this seemed to depend on the person who would end up being Consort to the Queen. In Westeros, Queen Rhaenyra first looked at lords and dashing knights looking for her favour. In such a case, it is likely that Rhaenyra would rule with all the power, and the consort would behave as an ordinary Queen Consort did. However, given she she married the former King's brother, her uncle, Daemon, people feared he would take control.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Make no mistake, <strong>should Rhaenyra ever sit the Iron Throne, it will be Daemon who rules us, a king consort</strong> as cruel and unforgiving as Maegor ever was. My own head will be the first cut off, I do not doubt, but your queen, my daughter, will soon follow.”<br>
  <sub>Princess and the Queen</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, he is still titled consort, suggesting that he is still titled as the spouse of the monarch despite having taken power.</p>

<p>Taking another example into account, Daenerys upon her return to Westeros and Prince Quentyn's plans of becoming her consort (before he gets fried).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A hundred years ago, Daenerys Targaryen came to Dorne to make a peace. Now another comes to make a war, and my brother will be her king and consort. King Quentyn. Why did that sound so silly?<br>
  <sub>The Winds of Winter - Arianne I</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While this gives us no details about how much power Quentyn would have, it reaffirms his role as consort.</p>

<p>In Meereen, on the other hand, the Queen seems to be in power, and on her departure the consort takes rule.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Daenerys, my queen, I will gladly wash you from head to heel if that is what I must do to be your king and consort.""<br>
  <sub>A Dance with Dragons - Daenerys VI</sub></p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
  <p>""Your Grace, I do not like this halt. This may be some trap. The Sons of the Harpy—""<br>
  ""—have been tamed,"" declared Hizdahr zo Loraq. ""Why should they seek to harm my queen when <strong>she has taken me for her king and consort? Now help that man, as my sweet queen has commanded.</strong>"" He took Dany by the hand and smiled.<br>
  <sub>ibid.</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above two passages suggest that the queen is in charge, albeit we see how that changes upon Daenerys' departure below.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hizdahr zo Loraq might be his queen's consort, but he would never be his king. ""If His Grace wishes for me to remove myself from court …""
  ""His Radiance,"" the seneschal corrected. ""No, no, no, you misunderstand me. His Worship is to receive a delegation from the Yunkai'i...<br>
  <sub>A Dance with Dragons - The Queensguard</sub></p>
  
  <p>All kneel for His Magnificence Hizdahr zo Loraq, Fourteenth of That Noble Name, King of Meereen, Scion of Ghis, Octarch of the Old Empire, Master of the Skahazadhan, Consort to Dragons and Blood of the Harpy,""<br>
  <sub> ibid. </sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that even by his own herald, he is titled Consort to Daenerys.</p>

<p>And now, finally, we can look at Nymeria and her consorts, which were merely counsellors and nothing more.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Though she married twice more (first to the aged Lord Uller of Hellholt, and later to the dashing Ser Davos Dayne of Starfall, the Sword of the Morning), Nymeria herself remained the unquestioned ruler of Dorne for almost twentyseven years, her husbands serving only as counselors and consorts.<br>
  <sub>The World of Ice and Fire - Ancient History: Ten Thousand Ships</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In conclusion, it is rather unclear as to what powers a consort would have, but in all cases they are second to the Queen; they can however, depending on their ""worth"" or ""rank"", rule over the queen.</p>

<p>As pointed out by <strong><a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/58405/21267"">Dima</a></strong>, Oberyn pierced Gregor in the gap underneath the arm:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Clegane lifted his own shield against the glare. Prince Oberyn’s spear flashed like lightning and found the gap in the heavy plate, the joint under the arm. The point punched through mail and boiled leather. Gregor gave a choked grunt as the Dornishman twisted his spear and yanked it free.

<h1>Pop, pop, bang</h1>

<p>Oberyn <em>does</em> later (at the end of the fight) pierce through Gregor's chest-plate armour, but he puts an incredible amount of force behind it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Slowly, ponderously, he [Gregor] rolled onto his back.<br />
  The Dornishman flung away his ruined shield, grasped the spear in both hands, and sauntered away. Behind him the Mountain let out a groan, and pushed himself onto an elbow. Oberyn whirled cat-quick, and <strong>ran at his fallen foe</strong>. “EEEEELLLLLLIIIIIAAAAA!” he screamed, as he <strong>drove the spear down with the whole weight of his body behind it</strong>. The crack of the ashwood shaft snapping was almost as sweet a sound as Cersei’s wail of fury, ...
  <br /><sup><em>-A Song of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 2: Blood and Gold - Chapter 71 (Tyrion X).</em></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<h1>I wouldn't touch him with an eight foot pole</h1>

<p>Remember, this is not any ordinary old spear:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The spear was turned ash eight feet long, the shaft smooth, thick, and heavy. The last two feet of that was steel: a slender leaf-shaped spearhead narrowing to a wicked spike. The edges looked sharp enough to shave with.
  <br />...<br />
  “You will have no cause for complaint. Though Ser Gregor may. However thick his plate, there will be gaps at the joints. Inside the elbow and knee, beneath the arms... I will find a place to tickle him, I promise you.”
  <br /><sup><em>-A Song of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 2: Blood and Gold - Chapter 71 (Tyrion X).</em></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<h1>Oberyn is now a Faceless Man</h1>

<p>As to the smashing of the face, Ser Gregor ""The Mountain"" Clegane was a humongous man, he has a tremendous body mass as well as strength:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gregor Clegane is well known for his size, cruelty, and prowess in battle. Gregor is extremely tall (he is close to eight feet in height). He has ""massive shoulders and arms thick as the trunk of small trees."" Gregor weighs over thirty stone (420 lbs), nearly all of it muscle, making him <strong>near inhumanly strong</strong>. Gregor's strength allows him to wield a six-foot, two-handed greatsword with just one hand, giving him enormous reach while still wielding a shield. Such is the power of Gregor's strength that he has been known to hack men in half with just a single blow.<sup><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Gregor_Clegane#Character_and_Appearance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jaime says of Cregor's strength:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Robert had been stronger than him [Jaime], to be sure. The White Bull Gerold Hightower as well, in his heyday, and Ser Arthur Dayne. Amongst the living, Greatjon Umber was stronger, Strongboar of Crakehall most likely, both Cleganes for a certainty. <strong>The Mountain's strength was like nothing human.</strong><br /><sup><em>-A Song of Ice and Fire: A Storm of Swords, Part 1 - Steel and Snow, Chapter 21 ([Jaime III][3]).</em></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So when Gregor shoves his hands and the weight of his whole body onto a man's face, it is not implausible for him to do the damage that he did. Albeit there is slightly less of a demolition of Oberyn's entire head in the books, nevertheless the face was crushed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He thrust his free hand into Oberyn’s unprotected face, pushing steel fingers into his eyes. “Then I raped her.” Clegane slammed his fist into the Dornishman’s mouth, making splinters of his teeth. “Then I smashed her fucking head in. Like this.” As he drew back his huge fist, the blood on his gauntlet seemed to smoke in the cold dawn air. There was a sickening crunch.

<p>Would he fight against the Mountain anyways if he got the chance?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","58454","<p>I think he liked Tyrion but I in no way think that his main motive for fighting was his fondness for Tyrion.</p>

<p>The whole reason he came to King's Landing was to find out what happened to his sister, who gave the order and if the Mountain did what Oberyn thought he did.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tyrion Lannister: Why did you come to King's Landing, Prince Oberyn?</p>
  
  <p>Oberyn Martell: I was invited to the royal wedding.</p>
  
  <p>Tyrion Lannister: I thought we were speaking truth. </p>
  
  <p>Oberyn Martell: [pause] The last time I was in the capital was many years ago. Another wedding. My sister Elia and Rhaegar Targaryen, the Last Dragon. My sister loved him. She bore his children. Swaddled them, rocked them, fed them at her own breast. Elia wouldn't let the wet nurse touch them. And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen... left her for another woman. That started a war, and the war ended right here, when your father's army took the city.</p>
  
  <p>Tyrion Lannister: It wasn't actually... </p>
  
  <p>Oberyn Martell: They butchered those children. My nephew and niece. Carved them up and wrapped them in Lannister cloaks. And my sister. You know what they did to her?</p>

  <p>Tyrion Lannister: I've heard rumors.</p>
  
  <p>Oberyn Martell: [chuckles] So have I. The one I keep hearing is that Gregor Clegane, the Mountain, raped Elia and split her in half with his greatsword. </p>
  
  <p>Tyrion Lannister: I wasn't there. I don't know what...</p>
  
  <p>Oberyn Martell: If the Mountain killed my sister, your father gave the order. 
  [pause] </p>
  
  <p>Oberyn Martell: Tell your father I'm here. And tell him the Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts. </p>

<p>Spoilers about the fight:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Throughout the fight scene he is constantly shouting ""Elia Martell of Dorne, you raped her, you murdered her. You killed her children."" This is aimed at the Mountain and is also for the crowd. He also looks to Tywin when he says ""Who gave you the orders?""</p>

<p>The fight results are featured in this spoiler:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> He is so obsessed with getting the Mountain to admit to what he has done that he eventually loses the fight because of this. </p>

<p>But something is not clear to me. Tywin Lannister earlier in season made a serious alliance offer to the Dorne, therefore such a finale was definitely not what he wanted; it would not help to make alliance with the Dorne at all. After all, Tywin does not hate his son Tyrion so strongly.</p>

<p>So, my question is this:</p>

<li>Did Tywin really instruct the Mountain that he could actually kill the opponent?</li>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","58608","<p><strong>This answer is based on A Storm of Sword and A Feast for Crows, so it will contain spoilers</strong></p>

<p><strong>The fight between Oberyn and Gregor was not part of Tywin's plan</strong>, however it was out of his control. As the mother of Joffrey, it was Cersei who chose Gregor as champion. Additionally, Tywin didn't know that Oberyn would volunteer as Tyrion's champion. So the whole fight was out of his hands. Tywin (and everybody else) was surprised that Oberyn volunteered as Tyrion's champion. Nobody thought that somebody, especially a Prince, would volunteer to fight the Mountain, particularly to save Tyrion.</p>

<p>[A Storm of Swords:Fire and Gold Spoilers]</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> It was Mace Tyrell who turned to Tyrion and asked the question. “Do
 you have a champion to defend your innocence?”
 <br />
 “He does, my lord.” Prince Oberyn of Dorne rose to his feet. “The
 dwarf has quite convinced me.”
 <br />
 The uproar was deafening. Tyrion took especial pleasure in the sudden
 doubt he glimpsed in Cersei’s eyes. It took a hundred gold cloaks
 pounding the butts of their spears against the floor to quiet the
 throne room again. By then Lord Tywin Lannister had recovered himself.
 “Let the issue be decided on the morrow,” he declared in iron tones.
 “I wash my hands of it.” He gave his dwarf son a cold angry look, then
 strode from the hall, out the king’s door behind the Iron Throne, his
 brother Kevan at his side.
 <br />
 ...<br />
 <br />
 No matter what happened, Tyrion had the satisfaction of knowing that
 he’d kicked Lord Tywin’s plans to splinters. If Prince Oberyn won, it
 would further inflame Highgarden against the Dornish; Mace Tyrell
 would see the man who crippled his son helping the dwarf who almost
 poisoned his daughter to escape his rightful punishment. And if the
 Mountain triumphed, Doran Martell might well demand to know why his
 brother had been served with death instead of the justice Tyrion had
 promised him. Dorne might crown Myrcella after all. It was almost
 worth dying to know all the trouble he’d made.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We learn before the fight that Tywin was planning on lying to Oberyn, and saying that it was Amory Lorch, not Gregor, who killed Elia and her children.</p>

<p>[A Storm of Swords:Fire and Gold Spoilers]</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> “And when Oberyn demands the justice he’s come for?”
 <br />
 “I will tell him that Ser Amory Lorch killed Elia and her children,”
 Lord Tywin said calmly. “So will you, if he asks.”
 <br />
 “Ser Amory Lorch is dead,” Tyrion said flatly.
 <br />
 “Precisely. Vargo Hoat had Ser Amory torn apart by a bear after the
 fall of Harrenhal. That ought to be sufficiently grisly to appease
 even Oberyn Martell.”
 <br />
 “You may call that justice...
 <br />
 “It is justice. It was Ser Amory who brought me the girl’s body, if
 you must know. He found her hiding under her father’s bed, as if she
 believed Rhaegar could still protect her. Princess Elia and the babe
 were in the nursery a floor below.”
 <br />
 “Well, it’s a tale, and Ser Amory’s not like to deny it. What will you
 tell Oberyn when he asks who gave Lorch his orders?”
 <br />
 “Ser Amory acted on his own in the hope of winning favor from the new
 king. Robert’s hatred for Rhaegar was scarcely a secret.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However Tyrion later reveals the truth to Oberyn (or part of it).</p>

<p>[A Storm of Swords:Fire and Gold Spoilers]</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> “I am not lying. Ser Amory dragged Princess Rhaenys out from under her father’s bed and stabbed her to death. He had some men-at-arms with him, but I do not know their names.” He leaned forward. “It was Ser Gregor Clegane who smashed Prince Aegon’s head against a wall and raped your sister Elia with his blood and brains still on his hands.”
 <br />
 “What is this, now? Truth, from a Lannister?” Oberyn smiled coldly. “Your father gave the commands, yes?”
 <br />
 “No.” He spoke the lie without hesitation, and never stopped to ask himself why he should.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Following the fight between Gregor and Oberyn, as Gregor is dying, and confessed during the fight, Tywin plans on giving him to the Martells. He tries to get Pycelle to save him, so that he can deliver him to the Martells alive.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> “Then I fear Ser Gregor may die.”

 “Undoubtedly. I swore as much in the letter I sent to Prince Doran

 King’s justice that slays him, not a poisoned spear. <strong>Heal him.</strong>”</p>

<p>However when it is clear he is going to die, delivering his head suffices.</p>

<p>[A Feast for Crows spoilers]</p>

 “Ah.” Ser Harys Swyft fumbled at his funny little beard with thumb and

"58698","Why did Tywin destroy Tyrion's marriage?","<p>I've read up to ADWD 2 and maybe this is explained, but if so, I missed it. What was the real reason that ... (spoilers for A Storm of Swords)</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> ... Tywin made Tyrion believe Tysha was a whore, and broke up their marriage. What would this achieve? I know that he's a cold, hard character, but I can't believe that he would be so callous as to force his thirteen year old son to watch as his wife was repeatedly raped before making him have sex with her himself, <em>just to teach Tyrion a lesson</em>. How did it serve Tywin's ends to 1) break up Tyrion's marriage and 2) do it in such a sadistic way?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Answers from the books or the series are acceptable.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","58699","<p>I think there are two primary reasons for both breaking it up and for being cruel about it. First, he wants to ensure that Tyrion doesn't attempt this kind of marriage again since the Lannisters can't marry commoners as they are nobles, Tyrion could potentially be useful for a political marriage, that sort of thing. Being brutal will make sure it doesn't happen again. Also, he wanted it to appear that Tysha was a whore rather than an honest girl to ensure that Tyrion did not trust other women.</p>

<p>Second, Tywin hates Tyrion for multiple reasons. First he has to put up with the shame of having a dwarf for a son. Second, it has been hinted that he is suspicious that he may not be Tyrion's actual father (because Aerys Targaryen was interested in Tyrions mother, Tyrion has non-typical features for a Lannister, genetic deformities run in the Targaryen line due to inbreeding) . Third he blames Tyrion for his mothers death.</p>

<p>In the end this was not some brilliant political play, in fact it was probably relatively dangerous for Tywin as opposed to some simplistic revenge like straight up having her killed. We can only explain this by saying that the end purpose was to hurt Tyrion.</p>

"191899","Can the Night King walk through wildfire?","<p>White Walkers can be eliminated by using fire. However, there are some cases that happened (in the series), where the Night King either walked right through it or the radiance of their coldness are far superior than the dragon fire's strength. (I have no idea whether a dragon's fire is just a normal fire).</p>

<p>Wildfire has been used to defeat Stannis and his alliances when he invaded King's Landing. Wildfire caused explosions that burned Stannis' fleet. Wildfire even surpassed a normal fire since its strength cannot be diminished by the water.</p>

<p>With the level a Wildfire has, is the Night King still able to walk through it? As far as I know, Wildfire can cause worse damages than normal fire.</p>

<p><em>Note: I haven't read the books yet.</em></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OgCIu.jpg"" alt=""Wildfire at the Battle of Blackwater""></p>
","<game-of-thrones>","192012","<h1><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kd0V5.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer"">We Do Not Know</a></h1>

<p>There are three types of fire in Game of Thrones and in order of least to most powerful they are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fire</li>
<li>Wildfire</li>
<li>Dragon fire</li>
</ul>

<p>From those three, we've only seen the White Walkers interact with one of the types of fire: fire. Here the fire parted around them to let them pass, how this happens is speculation but probably because ""They bring the cold with them"". See the below image from Season 6 Episode 5, ""The Door"".</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rCGs7.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rCGs7.jpg"" alt=""The Night King parts fire""></a></p>

<p>I believe a similar image is shown in Season 7 Episode 6, ""Beyond the Wall"", when the Night King and some White Walkers have fire around them.</p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum we have dragon fire, this is speculated to be able to kill White Walkers but as of yet we have not seen that happen. It is speculated because of dragon glass, or obsidian, which has been known to kill them, see <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/178443/58193"">my related answer here</a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have wildfire which I don't think has been seen to interact with White Walkers and even their wights. It is a mix between the two though probably closer to normal fire than dragon fire. I would speculate that it would not kill them but that is just speculation on my part and we are likely to know more in Season 8</p>

  <p> now that the White Walkers have broken through the Wall and man is going to throw everything they have at them.</p>

"
"58911","What title does the son of a lord have in A Song of Ice and Fire?","<p>I don't fully understand the system of titles in the ASOIAF series - referring to the books or the series equally - in terms of lords. Catelyn corrects a gaoler who uses the title ""Lord"" for Edmure Tully while Hoster Tully is alive in A Clash of Kings (bold emphasis mine):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Begging your forgiveness, m'lady, but <strong>Lord</strong> Edmure says no one is to see the Kingslayer without a writing from him, with his seal upon it.""</p>
  
  <p>""<em>Lord</em> Edmure? Has my father died, and no one told me?""
  ...</p>
  
  <p>""You will open the cell, or you will come with me to <strong>Lord</strong> Hoster's solar...""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, from this I understand that Edmure Tully isn't actually a Lord until Hoster Tully, Lord of Riverrun, dies. But what is Edmure's title? He wasn't knighted as far as I remember, so does he have any title at all while his father lives, as the first-born male? And while I understand that (spoilers for GOT) ...</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Robb Stark automatically becomes the Lord of Winterfell when Lord Eddard Stark dies (until he styles himself ""King in the North""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>... what about Bran and Rickon Stark? Do they have any titles, before or after this event? I seem to remember Maester Luwin addressing Bran as ""my prince"", but I may have imagined this, and if not may just be a term of affection than a tiele.</p>

<p>So basically I have two questions:</p>

<p>1) What title is given (if any) to the first-born male child of a Lord?</p>

<p>2) What title is given (if any) to any other children of a Lord?</p>

<p>Answers from the books or series are acceptable. Be sensitive of spoilers, of course.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","58926","<p>As with most things in ASoIaF, we're never given any clear explanation for their system of assigning titles -- the Westeros <em>rules of peerage</em>. We've seen this same issue pop up on this site many times, including <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/19910/why-is-cersei-commonly-referred-to-as-cersei-lannister-instead-of-cersei-bara/19928#19928"">Why is Cersei commonly referred to as &quot;Cersei Lannister&quot; instead of &quot;Cersei Baratheon&quot;?</a> or <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/38857/can-a-bastard-under-any-circumstance-become-a-lord-or-king-in-game-of-thrones?rq=1"">Can a Bastard, under any circumstance, become a Lord or King in Game of Thrones</a>. As with those other questions, since Martin seems to cleave pretty closely to medieval England for Westerosi society, we can make some very educated guesses.</p>

<p>In general, <em>any</em> member of a noble family would, upon reaching the age of majority, be entitled to be called Lord or Lady Whomever. Until the age of majority, boys would be called Master Whomever (e.g. Master Rickon or Master Tommon), which I believe we have seen in the novels as well. Underaged girls would usually get the honorific Lady anyway, as the direct counterpart to ""Master"" is ""Miss"", which isn't quite as formal.</p>

<p>The primary difference between the head of a House and his sons is that the actual Lord of a House, say Ned Stark, would be identified as any of the following, starting with the most formal: Lord of Winterfell, Lord Stark, Lord Eddard Stark, Lord Eddard. His son, however, is not entitled to either of the first two titles, only the last: Lord Robb Stark, or Lord Robb, so long as his father is alive.</p>

<p>There is, however, a key exception to this rule, and it's the one that Edmure Tully falls into. Namely, he's been knighted. From what I can tell, in the Westerosi rules of peerage, the title of ""Lord Tully"" would take precedence over the title ""Ser Edmure"", which in turn would take precedence over the simple title of ""Lord Edmure"". Thus, as long as Hoster Tully lives, his son is <em>Ser Edmure</em>, but upon Hoster's death, he would become <em>Lord Edmure</em>. That appears to be what Catelyn was chastising the gaoler about.</p>

<hr>

<p>As far as the comment about Brandon being a ""prince"", which I'm pretty sure was made at least once in the novels, that title would have been valid at any point after Robb declaring himself King in the North. As soon as the Stark's household and lesser sworn houses recognize Robb as their King, his brothers and sisters would immediately become Prince and Princess Whatever, as they would now be in line to inherit Robb's throne upon his death.</p>

<p>And there’s an <em>enormous</em> amount of stuff there. Each major family that we see in the show/books seems to have a fully-fleshed out dynasty stretching back hundreds or sometimes thousands of years, with descriptions of what each significant member did during their lives — what battles they fought in, how they gained and lost their power, and so on.</p>

<p>Do all of these stories <em>really</em> come from the books? (Presumably from conversations where characters discuss history.) I know the books are pretty hefty, but the history of the world as described by the wiki seems way more fleshed out than would be possible even in five novels.</p>

<p>What I'm wondering is why he did this, was it simply a way to take revenge against Tyrion or is there a rule in Trial By Combat which means you have to be executed if you lose (as the gods have made their wishes known)? Could Tywin still have sent him to The Wall if he so desired?</p>

<p>I've had a look through <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/56176/what-are-the-rules-of-trial-by-combat-in-game-of-thrones"">the rules</a>, but found no mention of this.</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","59109","<p>The reason Tyrion was not ordered to take the black was not because of the Trial itself. The purpose of the Trial by Combat is clear: to determine guilt or innocence. It does not appear to demand the death penalty if you are found guilty in and of itself, you can likely ask for the trial by combat in any situation where your honor is threatened. The problem is that Tyrion was found guilty of regicide specifically, a crime that is obviously going to be punishable by death in any monarchy that supports the death penalty.</p>

<p>Even if ordering Tyrion to take the black is an option, Tywin would never choose it because he <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/58698/why-did-tywin-destroy-tyrions-marriage/58699#58699"">hates Tyrion</a>, and because he would look like he was putting his family over justice in a moment of weakness.</p>

<p>Finally, the fundamental premise doesn't really make sense. If you want give leniency, you better give it before the combat because after it either the person who you wanted to save is typically dead, or you just lost a valued fighter and no longer need to give leniency anyway (since the accused won). If you want to give leniency it just doesn't make sense to do it AFTER a fight to the death. Not to mention the gods themselves found the person guilty.

<p>For example:</p>

<p>I'm no military strategist, but it seems to me that if your forces hold the strongest fortification in the history of the world, it behooves you to stay behind those fortifications and use them to your greatest advantage.</p>

<p>Why are the Night's Watch so insistent on ranging north and getting killed? Are they just bored of waiting and craving excitement?</p>

<p>Is it just a dramatic decision on the part of GRR Martin? If the Night's Watch were on top of their game, there'd be no story?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","59162","<p>I think the Night's Watch cannot defend the wall effectively any longer. </p>

<p>The wall is gargantuan and the number of ""combat capable"" Night Watchers is low. The Wildlings can scale the wall at any point and reach local superiority quite easily. This was even mentioned in the books - Wildlings are scaling the wall quite often.</p>

<p>So to defend the wall, you have to know where bigger attacks will happen. In other words: you need intelligence.
Without ranging, the Night's Watch would be blind, deaf and dumb: Widlings could concentrate their forces easily and defeat the very weak defense on the wall. 
With ranging, the night watch has a chance to detect such attempts beforehand and can concentrate it's forces.</p>

<p>Finally, the Mormont-ranging was done to prevent a huge army from attacking the wall. If it had succeeded, the Wildlings would have scattered and the wall would have been secure again.</p>

<p>The Night's Watch did not have nearly enough resources to do it's task, so it was doomed to fail.

"59165","Would the founder of a House use their own House name?","<p>Lann the Clever founded House Lannister, and King Durran Godsgrief founded House Durrandon (ancestors of the Baratheons,) but would you name them as ""Lann Lannister"" or ""Durran Durrandon""? It seems strange to me, and I can't find anyone else who does it. Yet they founded those respective houses. So the question is: should you apply the house name to their founders? Or should they stay Lann the Clever, and Durran Godsgrief?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","59193","<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> It's hard to know for sure, since all of the information we have from that time comes from legends and stories passed down by word of mouth(+), but I would say that it's highly unlikely that those two individuals would have ever been called ""Lann Lannister"" or ""Durran Durrandon"". Most likely, their House names did not become commonplace until long after those ""founders"" had died.</p>

<hr>

<p>For starters, it's important to note that the type of noble houses that exists in Westeros in the time of the novels is likely much different from the ones founded by legendary figures like Lann the Clever, or Durran Godsgrief. </p>

<p>The current form of nobility exists, in essence, at the pleasure of the King, and only the King can create new houses. In modern-day Westeros (like most of modern-day Earth), it's typical for even non-nobility to have a family name, and that would become the name of their new house. For example, Aegon I Targaryen created House Baratheon for his (rumored) half-brother Orys Baratheon, and Joffrey I Baratheon created House Slynt for Janos Slynt.</p>

<p>The houses you're talking about, on the other hand, like Stark and Arryn and Lannister, date back thousands of years, to the Age of Heroes, which leads to a few problems trying to figure out how they would have been named.</p>

<p>The first of those problems is deciding if they are even real people. According to Martin, these men are not supposed to be historical figures, but legendary archetypes of the ""old days"". When talking about Bran the Builder, building the Wall, Martin says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No one can even say for certain if Brandon the Builder ever lived. He is as remote from the time of the novels as Noah and Gilgamesh are from our own time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(From: <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/The_Wall"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/The_Wall</a>)</p>

<p>Even in-universe it's not clear how much of those stories are true, as Sam says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are archmaesters at the Citadel who question all of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even if those people existed, we have no real records of how they came to ""found"" their houses, nor any idea of what the naming conventions in effect at the time were. One thing we never see, however, is any last name assigned to the prominent figures of that time. They are <em>always</em> identified by their sobriquet, like ""Bran the Builder"" or ""Lann the Clever"" (in this sense, ""Godsgrief"" was not Durran's last name, but rather a sobriquet.)  We certainly never hear them identified as Bran Stark(++) or Lann Lannister, which we can <strong><em>speculate</em></strong> means that the naming conventions at that time were probably much more primitive, and that those people probably pre-dated formal surnames.</p>

<p>We also have no concrete evidence to prove that those specific individuals <em>actually</em> founded the houses that claim to be descended from them. The concept of noble houses, IMO, seems out of place for that time period. What I think is probably more likely (though again <strong>purely speculative</strong>) is that current Great Houses were not literally founded by those legendary figures, but rather, by their descendants, using their ancestry to bolster support for themselves. </p>

<p>As an example, House Lannister claims to be descended from Lann the Clever ""through the female line"". That seems odd if, in fact, Lann himself has founded the house: they would simply claim direct descent from Lann himself. However, if we assume that Lann existed, but did not actually found his own house, we can speculate that Lann's descendants began calling themselves Lannister, in the same sense that many early real-world surnames were originally patronyms (the afore-mentioned Erickson, or the Gaelic MacDonald or O'Connell). At some point down the line, someone important married one of the Lannister women, and decided to take her name, and thus her connection to Legendary Lann the Clever, when forming his own House. </p>

<p>A similar chain of events would have led to the eventual formal founding of the other noble houses, some of which had patronymic surnames (Durrandon) and others did not (Stark, Arryn).  Either way, the people usually identified as the ""founder"" of those houses <em>would not</em> have used those surnames for themselves.</p>

<hr>

<p>(+) There is, apparently, a lot more backstory from that time period available in the now-defunct <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> role-playing game material, but I have never read any of that, and wouldn't consider it to be canonical, since ASAIK Martin had nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>(++) UPDATE: There is, apparently, a DVD extra on the Season 1 Box Set, called a ""Complete Guide To Westeros"", that does identify Bran the Builder explicitly as ""King Brandon Stark"". However, none of this content was written by Martin (rather, by a staff writer for the show), and since this is the <em>only time</em> that he's ever been given a surname, my instinct is to call this non-canon and ignore it. YMMV.</p>

Daenerys was conceived near the time of Robert's Rebellion and the Battle of the Trident.

<li><strong>Jaime</strong> - Guy who is father to the late king and is King slayer.</li>

<p>This is not intended as a racist question. I just want to know why, since the story takes place over a large area, there doesn't seem to be any diversity.</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","59533","<p>The reason most of the main characters -- those who come from Westeros -- are ""caucasian"" is that <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire""><em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em></a> is inspired by the English <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_the_Roses"">War of the Roses</a> (Stark vs Lannister -- York vs Lancaster) and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian%27s_Wall"">Hadrian's Wall</a> in northern England. </p>

"126068","Did Tywin Lannister know Arya is not a commoner?","<p>While Arya was at Harrenhal with Tywin Lannister, he once corrected her about which people say ""my lord"", ""m'lord"" and/or ""milord"". As part of the discussion in <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/16722/7616"">this question</a>, there seems to be a common consensus, that Tywin (easily) figured out Arya is not who she claims to be.</p>

<p>I don't share this impression. I think Tywin believes Arya's story. I get to that conclusion because he never investigates any further, which I think he would have, if he hadn't bought her story.</p>

<p>There is a war going on between noble houses and if Tywin suspected an unknown (and therefore potentially hostile) noble close to him, I'm sure he would do something about it. However, I don't recall reading or watching anything about Tywin investigating Arya. To me, this draws a picture of Tywin just noticing this inconsistency about Arya, addressing it once, and letting go afterwards, because he is not curious anymore.</p>

<p>Is there any canon that proves Tywin is still suspicious about Arya? Or maybe canon showing he is certain he caught himself a noble in hiding and keeps her for fun?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","126071","<blockquote>
  <p>If you're going to pose as a commoner, you should do it properly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That one little sentence would seem to indicate he has figured it out. Tywin, it should be noted, is always shown as having a formidable intellect coupled with cunning and a chilling lack of empathy for others. That does not mean that he disregards their feelings; he knows that others feel, and uses their feelings to manipulate and, well, rule them. He is very, very, very good at what he does. Frankly, given the doofuses who have taken the throne, he probably would have been better than any of the others. Cruel when necessary but not otherwise, always cognizant of his responsibilities, and understanding that willy-nilly torturing and killing people is merely asking to be overthrown.</p>

<p>The point that I am trying to make is that for him, how Arya incorrectly addresses him is but one of many signs that he has penetrated her disguise. And they show this remarkably well in the show. A peasant would <em>always</em> keep their eyes averted, <em>not</em> speak up and out, not argue or disagree, not do all manner of things that Arya does. Combined with her way of incorrectly addressing him, it is obvious. The disguise works on others because people generally see what they want to see. And the high and powerful rarely see the low and weak, which is frankly one of the many reasons that most of them suck as rulers.</p>

<p>Twyin Lannister, however, is a ruler of a different breed. He actually pays attention to what is around him. Arya is either a peasant trying to appear to have come from noble origins (or something similar) or a noble trying to pretend to be otherwise. Given all the tiny mistakes and slip ups and attitude, the latter is more likely than the former.</p>

<p>This is especially true given that she is in a castle which was overrun, in which case the smart thing for any aristocrat would be to pretend to just be another peasant; generally, if one of the invaders thought she had a touch of noble blood, she might be killed outright just as a safety precaution. Arya is clearly not stupid, and therefore is trying to suppress rather than emphasize her background. She's is imperfect at it, but it functions.</p>

<p>Tywin knows that she isn't what she seems. And it amuses him to keep her as a pet. Had he known exactly who she was, I have little doubt he would have either held her prisoner or killed her without a second thought. But remember, Tywin is only cruel when he feels it necessary. A little girl clearly terrified and powerless who is nonetheless smart enough to keep quiet, maybe comes from a noble family which otherwise no longer exists, is not a threat and is unlikely to ever become one. Thus, there's no point in singling her out for cruelty.</p>

<p>Whereas Tywin finds himself surrounded by people who can't seem to see past the end of their noses. And Tywin, curiously, genuinely deeply loved his wife. Someone like him would seem to be incapable of loving a mindless yes-woman. So he knows and values a female intellect. And having a sharp mind around, that nobody else knows about or even properly really sees, sitting right in his pocket? A useful resource, and oddly a sort of friend for the friendless man. Someone to challenge his wits against, which is probably the closest Tywin gets to having a friend.</p>

<p>So, yes, it seems clear that Tywin knows that Arya isn't just some peasant. And it amuses him to draw her in closer rather than spurn her. If he could gain her trust, at the very least he would effectively create a very loyal spy that nobody else sees who could give him intelligent reports rather than just dumbly reporting conversation. Conversation is all well and good, but even better is someone who sneakily reads documents laying out even upside down while listening to a conversation. Tywin is arranging things such that all roads lead to advantage to him, a more or less trademark trait of his.</p>

<p>Edit: as an aside, it's a very drastic contrast with the book, where Arya serves Lord Bolton rather than Tywin. Bolton is terrifying because of his power and cruelty (flayed man sigil and all that) but is at least reeeeelatively stable (certainly compared to his son). So while he is somewhat unpredictable, so long as Arya is careful and quiet, she is probably relatively safe. </p>

<p>But with Tywin, her every word, every motion, they all betray her and scream what she is, if not who she is. It sets up a very different but I think much more interesting dynamic.</p>

<p>Tywin is not the only one who notices these things, by the way. The Faceless Man does as well. Part of her training of erasing her identity is to eradicate all of these telltale little traces of who and what she is, so hat in the future nobody can be able to detect her via such subtle cues.
Really going off here:
Which of course only further begs the question of how the faceless man ended up in the cage. He can change his looks and his actions at will, and appear to be someone else entirely. The only conclusion I can come to therefore is that he wanted to be captured. Why? Well, we know that people in this world receive messages from their respective gods. What if he was under instruction from his God of death, who wanted Arya as an acolyte for some reason to be revealed later, and this was done as a setup to gather Arya in? </p>

","<game-of-thrones>","59655","<p>Harren the Black was the man who built Harrenhal (short for Harren's Hall). He was the King of the Iron Islands and the Riverlands. When Aegon I Targaryen arrived in the Riverlands, Harren and his sons hid inside Harrenhal, believing that its mighty walls (it was, and still is, the biggest castle in Westeros) would protect him.</p>

<p>He was wrong. Aegon's dragon Balerion the Black Dread simply flew over the walls and breathed his fire into the castle, roasting everyone inside and melting most of the castle with it. Harren and all his issue died that day.</p>

<p>Aegon then gave the castle to House Qoherys who, like the Targaryens, were originally from Valyria. Eventually, for reasons undisclosed, House Qoherys died out.</p>

<p>Then it was given to House Towers, who also died out. Reasons unknown.</p>

<p>The castle then went to House Harroway who were related to King Maegor I Targayen through marriage. They too went extinct.</p>

<p>Harrenhal was then given to House Strong. Several members of that house died in mysterious fires, until that house died out.</p>

<p>The next lords to occupy Harrenhal were House Lothston who had a very fearsome and gruesome reputation.

The books mention how busy she is pretty much every day with her ruling duties.</p>

<p>Also, there is little need for her to fight.  She has guards, an army and dragons and no one expects her to lead from the front as a combatant so they do not lose respect for her when she does not.  Contrast this to Robert's leadership where his charisma was mainly based on his prowess as a warrior, if he avoided fighting his soldiers would have lost respect - Daenerys does not have this type of relationship with her followers.</p>

  maddened by a dozen lesser wounds, Dreamfyre spread her wings and flew
  straight up at the great dome above in a last desperate attempt to
  break into the open sky. Already weakened by blasts of dragonflame,

  <p>Morghul, it is written, was slain by the Burning Knight, a huge brute
  of a man in heavy armor who rushed headlong into the dragon’s flame
  with spear in hand, <strong>thrusting its point into the beast’s eye

  him and devoured the flesh within.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shrykos was the first dragon to succumb, slain by a woodsman known as
  Hobb the Hewer, who leapt onto her neck, driving his axe down into the
  beast’s skull as Shrykos roared and twisted, trying to throw him off.
  <strong>Seven blows did Hobb deliver with his legs locked round the dragon’s
  neck, and each time his axe came down he roared out the name of one of
  the Seven. It was the seventh blow, the Stranger’s blow, that slew the
  dragon, crashing through scale and bones into the beast’s brain.</strong></p>

<p>Another was apparently killed, either with a crossbow bolt but more likely with a grapnel:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Several differing tales were told afterward of how and why the dragon
  fell. Some claimed a crossbowman put an iron bolt through his eye, but
  this version seems suspiciously similar to the way Meraxes met her
  end, long ago in Dorne. Another account tells us that <strong>a sailor in the
  crow’s nest of a Myrish galley cast a grapnel as Vermax was swooping
  through the fleet. One of its prongs found purchase between two
  scales, and was driven deep by the dragon’s own considerable speed.
  The sailor had coiled his end of the chain about the mast, and the
  weight of the ship and the power of Vermax’s wings tore a long jagged
  gash in the dragon’s belly.</strong> The dragon’s shriek of rage was heard as
  far off as Spicetown, even through the clangor of battle. His flight
  jerked to a violent end, Vermax went down smoking and screaming,
  clawing at the water. Survivors said he struggled to rise, only to
  crash headlong into a burning galley. Wood splintered, the mast came
  tumbling down, and the dragon, thrashing, became entangled in the
  rigging. When the ship heeled over and sank, Vermax sank with her.</p>

To do that his travels would ultimately take him to one familiar place, The Crossroads Inn. This inn lies in the crossroads between the Kingsroad (crossing the Seven Kingdom north to south), the River Road (east to west) and the High Road (the only major road connecting the Vale with the rest of the Seven Kingdoms). It was at this inn that he was first captured, and going to anywhere in the Seven Kingdoms coming from the Vale necessitates a stop there.</p>

<p>When he does get there, it just so happens that Tywin Lannister had made it his campaign headquarters, probably to punish the owners in their role in Tyrion's capture.

","<game-of-thrones>","60060","<p>What we know now -- in either the books or the TV-show -- is all the information we have about them, as far as I recall. </p>

<p>In the TV-show, the wives burn down his keep and apparently prefer to be homeless in the Haunted Forest with winter coming. In the books, all we see is that they send off Gilly with Sam. The ""feeling"" you get when you read that particular chapter is that they stay to die, since ""Craster's sons"" are coming: </p>

  <p>Gilly was crying. ""Me and the babe. Please. I'll be your wife, like I

<p>However, they seem resilient, and they have survived many years with Craster, so presumably there's a chance they survived. But that is speculation on my part.</p>

<p>The TV-show explored the aftermath of the rebellion where Mormont died, but the books did not. In a way, the TV-show ending of the wives' story is a more pleasant end, while the original ending from the books is -- in my opinion -- darker, and more realistic. </p>

<p>It feels to me like GRRM wrote the ending with just a hint of the doom awaiting the wives, and then left the reader not knowing how it ended on purpose. Both to accomplish this sense of reality, that you don't know everything that happens in life, but also to save himself of having to finish the story of what happens to the wives.

<p>The original show itself was filmed without censorship. It is up to individual countries' broadcasting authorities &amp; their laws to decide what to permit onto their own screens. The scope of censorship can range from none at all, to mosaic-ing body parts out, to cutting out scenes, to an outright ban of the whole show from any form of broadcast, and anything in between.</p>

I don't know, I profess I do not follow the series. I'll need names for research to give you a more definite answer. Note: porn actresses, however bad they are at it, are still real actresses. Do not discriminate!</p>

<p>As an aside, you may be curious if they are having real sex. In general, sex scenes in non-porn acting doesn't involve real sex.

<p>Tywin claims that he wouldn't really have had Tyrion executed, though that was at crossbow-point and he very likely could have been lying to save his own skin.</p>

<p>Would he really have had Tyrion executed?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","126732","<p>It's quite different between the book and the show, but I think overall the sentiment can be summarised as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tyrion's fate is ultimately irrelevant to Tywin. Jaime's fate is the important thing in his eyes.</li>
<li>As long as Tyrion can be used as a bargaining chip for that purpose, there is no reason for Tywin to kill him off when he has non-lethal ways to achieve the same purpose.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the show, it's shown that the entire situation was a manipulation of Jaime, to move him to make the offer to return to Casterly Rock in exchange for Tyrion's life. The whole thing was a show of how well he has judged Jaime's character, and will gain him back as the heir to House Lannister. The deal he made there is to send Tyrion to the watch, and since the fundamental purpose is to get Jaime back, if the price is to not execute Tyrion and secretly ship him off to Castle Black, he still has an incentive to go through with the plan; it would just be secret instead of Tyrion making a formal plea. The deal between Jaime and him is the important one.</p>

<p>Now that's not as explicit in the book. In the book, as he's on the toilet, he tells Tyrion that his intent is still to send him to the Wall, but he needed Mace Tyrell's ""consent"". Tyrion ""never heard his father speak the words that condemned him"". Jaime speaks to Cersei after the trial and says this all his father wants to do is ""force me from the Kingsguard, and send me back to Casterly Rock"". The overall run of events might be there, but Jaime adamantly demands that he is not leaving the Kingsguard here, so that particular plot point can either be missing, or it's running implicitly in the background and Jaime doesn't want to reveal it to Cersei. I don't think it's the latter - if it is the latter, Jaime has no incentive to free Tyrion and change the course of events.</p>

<p>You can look at it in many ways from there:</p>

<ul>
<li>Maybe Tywin will execute Tyrion, and from there use the lack of heir to try and convince Jaime to step in as Heir of Casterly Rock.</li>
<li>Maybe Tywin will send Tyrion to the Wall, and from there use the lack
of heir to try and convince Jaime to step in as Heir of Casterly
Rock.</li>
<li>Mace Tyrell has had a clear grievance in this matter (his daughter could have been poisoned as well). However, Tywin isn't stupid enough to give in all the way and put his house in danger to placate House Tyrell. Maybe the concession of the Black allows the opportunity for him to secretly ""keep"" Tyrion at hand (by pretending to lose him in transit etc.).</li>

"60345","Who can knight you so that the knighting 'sticks'?","<p><strong>Motivating scenario:</strong></p>

<p>I'm a swell upstanding guy, so Ser/Lord X, an acquaintance of mine, knights me. So I walk into my village tavern; the barkeep asks ""What'll it be, friend?"" and I tell him ""That's 'Ser' to you now. I have been knighted by X!"" He sneers and goes ""well then, X can call you Ser if he likes.""</p>

<p><strong>Actual Question:</strong></p>

<p>What about a person's being knighted makes the knighting 'stick'? Is it the identity/standing of the knighter (is that a word?) ? Is it the fact that many other knights walk around telling people that the new guy is also a Knight? Is it the public nature of the knighting?</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">Wiki of Ice and Fire</a> says <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Knight"" rel=""nofollow"">the following</a> about knighting:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This usually happens when a squire reaches adulthood and his master
  judges him worthy of accepting the responsibilities of a knight. A man
  who has not been raised in the knightly tradition can also be made a
  knight as a reward for service. This is often granted to soldiers or
  other smallfolk who have shown bravery or performed a great feat.</p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><names><laws>","60352","<p>tl;dr: </p>

<p><em>In theory</em>, a Westerosi knight gains is title when the knight he is squired to deems him ready, or when he does something to gain the favor of a lord or monarch (almost always militarily.)</p>

<p><em>In practice</em>, anyone can basically call themselves a knight, and as long as they look and act the part (which basically boils down to having a horse and armor), and people are willing to call them Ser, that's all that matters. The more well-known a knight becomes (serving powerful lords, having impressive military service, etc) the more likely people will be to accept the title at face value.</p>

<hr>

<p>Historically speaking, the term ""knight"" has evolved over the course of the Middle Ages to mean several very different things. Early on, a ""knight"" was essentially any well-equipped, mounted soldier fighting for his monarch, lord, the Church, etc. Over time, knighthood turned into a sort of minor nobility, and the title become more and more official. It was during this time that the concept of ""orders"" or knights that followed specific codes of conduct, and more generally the code of chivalry, gained favor. By the time of the War of the Roses (the period of English history that Westeros is roughly based on), knighthood was a very formal title, usually granted by the ruling monarch, Pope, or other very powerful political figure, and came with official documents (letters patent) granting the title. This is basically where things stand today, apart from the fact that the title is purely honorary, independent of any military service.</p>

<p>Westerosi culture seems to be stuck very early in this progression of knighthood, where there were no official orders of knighthood and no central authorities bestowing the titles on people. The title of Ser in Westeros seems to follow the same basic process as the craft trades: a potential knight is handed over to a current knight as a youngster to become a squire (an ""apprentice knight""), learning the craft until he gets good enough to be declared a knight of his own. In this sense, anyone who is currently recognized as a knight can declare their squires knights, in their own right, when they feel they are ready.</p>

<p>Of course, as this is basically the honor system, it's rife for abuse. No central authority ensures that the so-called knights meet any particular qualification, and there's no real set of rules they have to follow. Oddly, it seems that the popular <em>ideal</em> of chivalrous knights has arisen in Westeros, but without the practical reality of chivalrous orders to back it up. And, other than the ruling monarch stripping someone of their title (which I don't know that we've ever seen), once a knight, always a knight.</p>

<p>On the other hand, since being a knight has no ""official"" meaning in Westeros, people are conditioned to just assume any well-equipped, mounted soldier, especially one that serves under a king or lord, is probably a knight. And as long as people are willing to grant that title to those soldiers, and they are willing to accept it, that's about all that matters. This is why The Hound is so adamant that he's not a knight: he both looks and acts the part, so anyone meeting him will almost immediately assume he is one, until he claims otherwise.</p>

  <p> Given that dragonglass kills the Others wouldn't it be easier to equip armies with dragonglass weapons than build a Wall this massive?</p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","60367","<p>I think the simplest explanation would be this:</p>

<p>When you have an army of zombies ready to attack any given moment, you would have to have guards from coast to coast ready to kill zombies every second. The Wall is ~300 miles long. So, to guard all that space without a 'barrier', you would need hundreds and thousands of warriors. </p>

<p>With the Wall, the Night's Watch had the ability to have a lot of warriors/defenders (of the realm), but not all of them where posted on guard at the same time. Some of them are guarding the Wall, and when they see an army or whatever advancing towards them, they can warn the rest of the defenders of the realm.</p>

<ul>
<li>Where do they come from?</li>
<li>Is there a proper name for their species?</li>
<li>Are there any ""Giant Cities"" (civilizations) north of the Wall?</li>
</ul>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","126796","<p>We don't know that much about the giants' culture and origin, but the <em>World of Ice and Fire</em> does give us a little info, mostly about where they lived.</p>
<p>I don't think GRRM has mentioned exactly how they came to be (their origin story), and I cannot find anything relevant in any of the books. Also, the only name for their race we have seen so far is <em>giants</em>. There might be something else they call themselves in their own tongue, but we don't know.</p>
<p>On the chapter <strong>Ancient History: The Dawn Age</strong> there are quite a few mentions about the ways the giants used to live:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of the giants in the Dawn Age, little and less can be said, for no one has gathered their tales, their legends, their histories.</p>
<p><sub>Ancient History: The Dawn Age</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They certainly didn't have cities in the way we people think of them, because they made no houses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The giants had no kings and no lords, made no homes save in caverns or beneath tall trees</strong>, and they worked neither metal nor fields.</p>
<p><sub>Ancient History: The Dawn Age</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the book, there is also some mentions about the places the giants used to live (south of the wall), but people drove them away. Generally, some maesters believe that before the First Men came, Westeros belonged to the Giants and the Children of the Forest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Were the First Men truly first?</p>
<p>Most scholars believe they were. Before their coming, it is thought, Westeros belonged to the giants, the children of the forest, and the beasts of the field. But on the Iron Islands, the priests of the Drowned God tell a different tale.</p>
<p><sub>The World of Ice and Fire - The Iron Islands</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of the places that the giants are mentioned to have lived are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the hills in Westerlands (and more specifically the Castely Rock) (<sub><em>mentioned in The World of Ice and Fire - The Westerlands and  The Westerlands: Casterly Rock</em></sub>)</li>
<li>the Reach (<sub><em>The Reach: Garth Greenhand</em></sub>)</li>
<li>the Red Mountains (<sub><em>The Stormlands: The Coming of the First Men</em></sub>)</li>
</ul>
<p>There has also been some evidence of giants across the Narrow Sea:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Norvos (<sub><em>The Free Cities: Norvos</em></sub>)</li>
<li>In The Grasslands (<sub>* Beyond the Free Cities: The Grasslands*</sub>)</li>
<li>In Ib (<sub><em>Beyond the Free Cities: Ib</em></sub>)</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also another race of giants, named <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jhogwin"" rel=""noreferrer"">Jhogwin</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jhogwin were the stone giants of Dothraki legend. They were massive creatures said to have been twice as large as the giants of Westeros. They once inhabited the snowcapped northernmost region of the Bone Mountains in Krazaaj Zasqa or White Mountains in the Dothraki tongue, an area that is known as the Realm of the Jhogwin.

<p>If the dragons are frustrated living in a dungeon for so long, and they see a stranger, why didn't they attack? If somebody familiar went down to free them, it would be understandable, but why wouldn't they attack a complete stranger?</p>

  <p> Quentyn's companions are keen to return to Dorne but Quentyn refuses

 He hatches a plan, hoping that he will be able to tame at least one of
 the dragons due to his Targaryen ancestry. For this purpose, he
 arranges a meeting with the Tattered Prince, hiring the Windblown's

 asking for Pentos in return. Quentyn signs an agreement.<br><br>

 Viserion, but Rhaegal attacks Quentyn from behind, and bathes him in
 dragonfire. The Windblown mercenaries flee, and both dragons escape.<br><br><br>
 
 Missandei takes care of Quentyn, but he dies in Daenerys Targaryen's
 bed four days later, covered in burns. Upon seeing the extent of the
 prince's injuries, Ser Barristan thinks it would have been better if

 quicker and less painful in such a case.<br><br> </p>

<p>It contradicts, but could imply that Tyrion just has very valiant despite his small stature.  Quentyn thought his blood was enough, whereas Tyrion has the confidence to tame them.  </p>

<p>It really makes no sense and is inconsistent with the book, so who really knows?  Bad storytelling maybe.</p>

<hr>

<p>After the battle at the Wall, the Free Folk are given the chance to 'bend-the-knee' and be pardoned in order to be spared, including Rattleshirt.</p>

<p>A short while later Mance Rayder is burned upon the Pyre by Melisandre and Stannis.</p>

<p>We later find out that it is <strong>not actually Mance</strong>, but Rattleshirt who gets burned.</p>

<p>A little bit later on, in the yard Jon defeats some of his men in training, after which  RattleMance turns up and challenges Jon to a duel. But Jon says something really curious:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The big crow can peck the little crows,” growled a voice behind him, “but has he belly enough to fight a man?”<br />
  Rattleshirt was leaning against a wall. A coarse stubble covered his sunken cheeks, and thin
  brown hair was blowing across his little yellow eyes.<br />
  “You flatter yourself,” Jon said. <br />“Aye, but I’d flatten you.”<br />
  <strong>“Stannis burned the wrong man.”</strong><br />
  “No.” The wildling grinned at him through a mouth of brown and broken teeth. “He burned the

<p>You must bear in mind that we had no idea how exactly the bones came to be. <strong><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Drogon"">Drogon</a></strong> was said to have been responsible for them, but there are a few scenarios which this could have happened:</p>

<li>he might have just been burning something nearby, or </li>
<li>might have just devoured the carcass, passing the bones (which were scorched due to the insides of the dragon being extremely hot, or</li>

<p><strong>Chains Were Made to be Broken</strong><br>
The metal chains were only truly to get the dragons <em>into</em> the pit, beyond that there was no guarantee that the chains would hold. In fact, <strong><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Viserion"">Viserion</a></strong> had actually broken through his:</p>

The bones on the floor of the pit were deeper than the last time she had been down here, and the walls and floors were black and grey, more ash than brick.

<p>Perhaps given time, they <em>could</em> burn through the walls/doors (but that's just conjecture).<br>
Take note also that there are a pile of bones. We don't know if they are scorched or not, but that definitely shows that an encounter with a dragon <strong>can</strong> leave bones behind!</p>

A younger son of Viserys Plumm, I’d wager. The queen’s dragons were fond of you, were they not?”<br />That seemed to amuse the sellsword. [Plumm:]“Who told you that?” <br />[Tyrion:]“No one.

<li>Unicorns exist and are as common as horses and fish. This doesn't seem likely to me, since these are not mentioned as much as these animals.</li>

"60965","Was Prince Joffrey’s cruelty inherited from his mother?","<p>The question arose in my mind after watching season 4 episode 7. In it</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Prince Oberyn tells Tyrion about his visit a long time ago, and how cruel Cersei was to the little baby Tyrion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems like Cersei has the same tendency for cruelty as Joffrey himself. Is it true? What do the books specifically say about Cersei's psychology and behaviour, for example, in childhood, besides the story told by Oberyn?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","60967","<p>Cersei is <strong>not</strong> the primary source of Joffrey's cruelty.</p>

<p>The clearest evidence is that, in both books and TV series, her other children Tommen and Myrcella are portrayed as pleasant, intelligent and well-balanced individuals. Both are as ""normal"" as can be expected given their royal upbringing.</p>

<p>Also, Cersei's ""cruelty"" is not on the same level as Joffrey's. This becomes particularly clear in the book <em>A Feast For Crows</em>, in which</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> there are many chapters from Cersei's point of view, as she rules the seven Kingdoms as regent on behalf of Tommen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cersei is mean, petty, vindictive, insecure, and paranoid, but she is still mostly a sane and rational human being. Her cruelty is shown to originate from her fear and insecurity. As the audience, we may consider her behaviour evil but we can still understand it.</p>

<p>By contrast, Joffrey is a pure psychopath who inflicts pain simply because he enjoys it. There is no rational explanation for most of what he does.</p>

<p>A good illustration of the difference between Joffrey and Tommen is their attitude towards animals:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> In the book <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, we hear the story of how as a child, Joffrey killed a pregnant cat by cutting open her belly. Nobody encouraged him to do this, it was an early indication of Joffrey's own extreme sadism. On the other hand, in <em>A Storm of Swords</em> and later books, Tommen is shown as being particularly fond of cats and he would never harm one as Joffrey did.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The consequences of Joffrey's action are interesting. King Robert hit him so hard that one of his baby teeth was knocked out, but didn't follow up on the matter. Cersei was horrified by the injury to Joffrey and didn't take any interest in the reason why Robert had hit him. Joffrey seems to have learned he could get away with anything he wanted, as long as Robert didn't find out.</p>

<h2>The Maesters of the Citadel</h2>

<p>These are people who have dedicated their lives to study, and discard their family names in an effort to shed past loyalties. They study a variety of disciplines including astronomy, meteorology, chemistry, medicine, economics, history, politics, smithery and even magic (though magic is mostly studied as an oddity for historic purposes). They are assigned to different lords to act as advisers, teachers and post masters. The Citadel is funded by taxes levied by the city of Old Town (where it resides) and by payments the lords of the realm make to the Citadel in exchange for the service of its Maesters.</p>

<h2>The Alchemists Guild</h2>

<p>Concentrating more on the chemical side of science, these people have been largely supplanted in importance by the Maesters. Their only claim to relevancy these days seems to be their monopoly on the creation of Wildfire, which is probably their only remaining source of funds.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Technological Level</h2>

<p>There <em>is</em> a steady increase in technological know how in Westeros. The advent of the First Men (12,000 years ago) brought with it bronze technology, the Andals (2,000-6,000 years ago) brought iron. Though it does seem that it is quite slow by our standards. Many theories have been brought forward (see this <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/20944/why-is-it-that-after-8-000-years-technology-in-westeros-has-not-evolved-in-the"">question</a>), but the existence of magic and the harsh weather patterns may have been a factor.</p>

<p>In <em>A Storm of Swords</em>, Robb and Catelyn have the following conversation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Mother.” There was a sharpness in Robb’s tone. “You forget. My father
  had four sons.”</p>
  
  <p>She had not forgotten; she had not wanted to look at it, yet there it
  was. “A Snow is not a Stark.”</p>
  
  <p>“Jon’s more a Stark than some lordlings from the Vale who have never
  so much as set eyes on Winterfell.”</p>
  
  <p>“Jon is a brother of the Night’s Watch, sworn to take no wife and hold
  no lands. Those who take the black serve for life.”</p>
  
  <p>“So do the knights of the Kingsguard. That did not stop the Lannisters
  from stripping the white cloaks from Ser Barristan Selmy and Ser Boros
  Blount when they had no more use for them. If I send the Watch a
  hundred men in Jon’s place, I’ll wager they find some way to release
  him from his vows.”</p>
  
  <p>He is set on this. Catelyn knew how stubborn her son could be. “A
  bastard cannot inherit.”</p>
  
  <p>“Not unless he’s legitimized by a royal decree,” said Robb. “There is
  more precedent for that than for releasing a Sworn Brother from his
  oath.” </p>

<p>Robb then has a council with his lords as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He picked up a sheet of parchment. “One more matter. Lord Balon has
  left chaos in his wake, we hope. I would not do the same. Yet I have
  no son as yet, my brothers Bran and Rickon are dead, and my sister is
  wed to a Lannister. I’ve thought long and hard about who might follow
  me. I command you now as my true and loyal lords to fix your seals to
  this document as witnesses to my decision.”</p>

Arya: ""<em>Which name would you like a girl to speak?</em>""</p>

<p>Did Arya actually fail this test? Did the waif know Arya was lying about the length of her list and then started testing her by using the second person pronoun, <strong>you</strong>. And Arya did respond to <strong>you</strong>. Previously, Arya only talked about herself in the third person.</p>

<p>Or, had Arya's feelings actually changed? Realizing she was too blood thirsty, she had shortened her kill list even before going to Braavos?  </p>

<p>And, what did Gregor Clegane ever do to House Stark? Why is he on the shortened kill list? Tywin did order him to raid the Riverlands in season 1, and House Tully is from the Riverlands, and Arya's mother is from House Tully... so is that why Arya hates the Mountain more than even Joffrey? Tywin? (<code>Arya could not know that they are both dead</code>)</p>

<p>Ser Gregor was on the list because he was with the group of soldiers who captured Arya and her friends and took her to Harrenhal.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was never supposed to be on the Kingsguard. Oh, as a boy, I dreamed of the white cloak like all boys. But I was heir to Tywin Lannister, Hand of the King. If he forbade the tides, the waves would cease. Then I was 15, and my father was congratulating me on my new knighthood in the Red Keep. I wonder if that was the last time he was proud of me.</p>
<p>That night, there was a knock on my door, and I'd opened it to find my sister Cersei disguised as a simple serving girl. I hadn't seen her since my father took her to court when she was 12. She had grown up. As had I. She told me that my father planned to marry me off to Lysa Tully. <strong>But she could arrange for the King to raise me to the Kingsguard so I could stay in the city with her. All I had to do was agree.</strong> I made the obvious objections. Our family, our father, Casterly Rock. Until she asked, &quot;Is it a rock you want, or me?&quot; Come morning, she had my consent. I would join the Kingsguard for her. I would forswear my lands and title for her. I would forsake our family for her.</p>
<p>Soon, a royal raven commanded my father to present me to the King during the Great Tourney at Harrenhal to say my vows. My father erupted in fury.

</blockquote>
<p>Even looking into the relevant passages in the books yields no further information, here is Jaime's POV thought process on what happened.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jaime, meantime, had spent four years as squire to Ser Sumner Crake-hall and earned his spurs against the Kingswood Brotherhood. But when he made a brief call at King's Landing on his way back to Casterly Rock, chiefly to see his sister, Cersei took him aside and whispered that Lord Tywin meant to marry him to Lysa Tully, had gone so far as to invite Lord Hoster to the city to discuss dower. <strong>But if Jaime took the white, he could be near her always.</strong> Old Ser Harlan Grandison had died in his sleep, as was only appropriate for one whose sigil was a sleeping lion. Aerys would want a young man to take his place, so why not a roaring lion in place of a sleepy one?</p>
<p>&quot;Father will never consent,&quot; Jaime objected.</p>
<p>&quot;The king won't ask him. And once it's done, Father can't object, not openly. Aerys had Ser Ilyn Payne's tongue torn out just for boasting that it was the Hand who truly ruled the Seven Kingdoms. The captain of the Hand's guard, and yet Father dared not try and stop it! He won't stop this, either.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But,&quot; Jaime said, &quot;there's Casterly Rock...&quot;</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Is it a rock you want? Or me?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>He remembered that night as if it were yesterday. They spent it in an old inn on Eel Alley, well away from watchful eyes. Cersei had come to him dressed as a simple serving wench, which somehow excited him all the more. Jaime had never seen her more passionate. Every time he went to sleep, she woke him again. By morning Casterly Rock seemed a small price to pay to be near her always. <strong>He gave his consent, and Cersei promised to do the rest.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A moon's turn later, a royal raven arrived at Casterly Rock to inform him that he had been chosen for the Kingsguard.</strong> He was commanded to present himself to the king during the great tourney at Harrenhal to say his vows and don his cloak.</p>
<p>Jaime's investiture freed him from Lysa Tully. Elsewise, nothing went as planned. His father had never been more furious. He could not object openly—Cersei had judged that correctly—but he resigned the Handship on some thin pretext and returned to Casterly Rock, taking his daughter with him. Instead of being together, Cersei and Jaime just changed places, and he found himself alone at court, guarding a mad king while four lesser men took their turns dancing on knives in his father's ill-fitting shoes.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3>Speculation time</h3>
<p>As nothing is known canonically that I'm aware of it is time for some speculation of what Cersei actually did.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Had an open conversation with the King</strong> - seems an unlikely route to take but it could have happened.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Spoke about Jaime and the Kingsguard near Aerys</strong> - this seems quite likely, she could have just planted the idea into Aerys' mind by talking about it near him.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Performed sexual acts for Aerys</strong> - certainly in keeping with Cersei and her going to great lengths to get what she wants but I'm not sure it would have happened.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Nothing</strong> - She could have overheard that Jaime was already in line to join the white cloaks or just assumed he would be.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Ask someone else to talk to the King</strong> - She could have approached someone else in court, perhaps on the Small council, and asked them to consider Jaime. This wouldn't have been too hard to do without Tywin finding out as it is very likely he had a lot of enemies at court and so they probably wouldn't have passed the information on.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>Now to answer your other questions. <em>Why are they so mad because of this?</em> Well the above quotes make it abundantly clear why:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cersei and Jaime rejected to it because they were now forced apart again and now on the context of not being able to be back together again.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tywin rejected because Aerys now removed his heir to Casterly Rock and replaced it with Tyrion - a dwarf that Tywin really would rather see anywhere but that position.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Was Rhaegar already married at this point?</em></p>
<p>Yes, Rhaegar was married to Elia in 280 AC and Jaime was appointed to the Kingsguard in 281 AC at the Tourney at Harrenhal. It is not exactly clear where in the timeline Cersei came to Jaime with the proposition but I believe he was already married at that point.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Early in the year 279 AC</strong>, Rhaegar Targaryen, Prince of Dragonstone, was formally betrothed to Princess Elia Martell, the delicate young sister of Doran Martell, Prince of Dorne. <strong>They were wed the following year</strong>, in a lavish ceremony at the Great Sept of Baelor in King's Landing, but Aerys II did not attend.</p>

"63189","Was Jorah pardoned twice?","<p>I've been watching some arbitrary Game of Thrones. In the episode S01E07, ""You Win or You Die"", a child approaches Ser Jorah the Andal and tells him that he has received a royal pardon.</p>

<p>Jorah decides to stay with Dany, and he saves her life from the poisoned wine.</p>

<p>Why, if so, at the end of the fourth season he is given a second pardon which causes Dany to send him away?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","63225","<p>This is a show-only event, and it is a direct consequence of it being impossible to show <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Barristan_Selmy"">Ser Barristan</a> joining <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daenerys"">Daenerys</a> incognito without the viewers realizing the deception. In the books, it was Ser Barristan who revealed <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jorah"">Ser Jorah's</a> betrayal. In the show, it was <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tywin_Lannister"">Tywin</a> who did it by sending an official pardon to Daenerys -- thereby betraying Jorah and weakening Dany by sowing discord between them. The show and the books have been forced to deviate from each other here, mostly because watching is different from reading. I'll try and relate both perspectives briefly:</p>

<p>In the books, Ser Barristan goes to Daenerys in disguise, calling himself Arstan, a squire to the pit-fighter Strong Belwas (a favourite character to many). He does this so that he will be able to observe Dany before swearing his sword to her, to see that she is not mad like her father. In the end, he reveals himself when he saves Dany's life when she is ambushed by <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Mero"">Mero of Braavos</a>, aka the Titan's Bastard. This is also when he reveals Jorah as the spy who has been selling Dany's secrets.</p>

<p>In the show, we immediately see that Arstan is Ser Barristan, so it is not possible to keep the illusion from the books. Hence, Ser Barristan cannot keep the secret of Jorah hidden until future seasons, which means in the show, he never knew. Mero is killed by Daario, and the secret of Jorah is revealed by Tywin. </p>

<p>In the end, the show was forced to do quite a few re-writes to make this work. One of my least favourite re-writes was that they changed the designation ""old man"" from Arstan (Ser Barristan in disguise) to Ser Jorah in the scene with the slaver from Astapor and Missandei:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Even the bravest men fear death and maiming,"" Arstan said when the girl was done.
  <p>
  Kraznys smiled again when he heard that. ""Tell the old man that he smells of piss, and needs a stick to hold him up.""
  <p>
  ""Truly, your worship?"" [said Missandei]
  <p>
  He poked her with his lash. ""No, not truly, are you a girl or a goat, to ask such folly? Say that Unsullied are not men. Say that death means nothing to them, and maiming less than nothing.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But all in all, the show did a good job, and the revelation of Jorah still gets a poignant touch, though it is Tywin who sends a malignant message that destroys the trust Dany has in Jorah. As opposed to Ser Barristan's honour.</p>

<p>This is a good example of how adaptations to a visual media are difficult to perform, and that small changes grow bigger and bigger further along the storyline. </p>

"127790","Who is the dual wielding kingsguard in the Tower of Joy scene?","<p>It appears half of internet is in consensus that dual sword wielder in the Tower of Joy scene is Arthur Dayne, sword of the morning. We know that the fight in the book was 7 vs 3, but in the scene it is 6 vs 2, one of the two being Arthur Dayne. However I noticed a few unsettling details:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the book, there are three kingsguards in the fight. One of them is the Lord Commander Gerold Hightower. Kingsguard is a military organization where rank would be respected utmost. It is conceivable that he did most of the talking.</p></li>
<li><p>We know from the books that Dawn is a greatsword. Very few can wield a greatsword single handedly. (Mountain is one of them.) We also know from the books that ""“And now it begins,” said Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. He unsheathed Dawn and held it with both hands. The blade was pale as milkglass, alive with light."" Hence, Arthur Dayne could not wield dual swords.</p></li>
<li><p>The scene starts with a close up to a sword, wielded by some curly haired kingsguard. Dawn is the most famous sword in the whole Westeros. It makes sense that the scene starts with a close up to the most famous sword.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Hence, it might have been Gerold Hightower. However, there are some unsettling details that contradict with my observation.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The last talking I quoted above is done by Arthur Dayne. He was wielding two swords in the scene.</p></li>
<li><p>Arthur Dayne should be the most skilled fighter of his age. An easy defeat doesn't fit his legacy.</p></li>
<li><p>Bran and Brynden seems to be talking only about one man. And at the beginning of their talk, they use the name explicitly as ""Arthur Dayne"".</p></li>
</ol>

<p><em>Edit: This is a pro list of the dual wielder being Arthur Dayne. Easy defeat refers to the death of the single sword wielder Kingsguard.</em></p>

<p>So my question is this: Is the dual wielder Arthur Dayne and the unsettling details I noticed are wrong, or is there no way to connect the portrayal in the series with the portrayal in the books accurately?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","127795","<p>It's Arthur Dayne. Gerold Hightower is bypassed for the show (I don't believe he's mentioned at all, even in the scene where Joffrey is reading from the White Book iirc).</p>

The fact that Howland Reed got a knife into the back is .... basically luck, and is a totally new addition. It's meant to enhance Dayne's legacy that it took that to defeat him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's entirely possible that Arthur Dayne dual-wields because Dawn is not made a big mention of in the show, so only book readers would find it a tease, and they wanted a 1v4. Dayne himself was made a big deal of in the show (in the scene with Joffrey and the White Book), but Dawn isn't really. It adds additional exposition to focus on it, when Dayne's legend is already built up.</p>

"267275","What is the nature of King Viserys Targaryen's skin disease?","<p>In <em>House of the Dragon</em>, it was revealed that King Viserys Targaryen has a skin disease that &quot;refuses to heal.&quot; I'm wondering if it's one of the <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Category:Diseases"" rel=""noreferrer"">fictional diseases in the <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> series</a>, or if it's a real-life disease.</p>
<p>Related dialogue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Viserys:</strong> Is it healing?<br />
<strong>Grand Maester Mellos:</strong> It has grown slightly, Your Grace.<br />
<strong>Viserys:</strong> Can you say yet what it is?<br />
<strong>Young maester:</strong> We've sent inquiries to the Citadel. They are searching the texts for similar cases.<br />
<strong>Viserys:</strong> It's a small cut from sitting the throne. It's nothing.<br />
<strong>Mellos:</strong> The King has been under heavy stresses preparing for the birth. Bad humors of the mind can adversely affect the body.<br />
<strong>Otto Hightower:</strong> Whatever it is, it needs to be kept quiet.<br />
<strong>Mellos:</strong> We should leech it again, maester.<br />
<strong>Young maester:</strong> It's a wound that refuses to heal, Grand Maester. Might I suggest cauterization?<br />
<strong>Mellos:</strong> Cauterization would be a wise course of treatment, Your Grace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><sup>- <em>House of the Dragon</em> S01E01 &quot;The Heirs of the Dragon&quot;</sup></p>
<p>Viserys' wound looks like a skin ulcer. Viserys would later get another cut, on his finger, from the iron throne. In episode 2, the maesters attempt to treat the wound with maggots.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Grand Maester Mellos:</strong> This is our best chance to save the digit, Your Grace. The maggots will remove the dead flesh and hopefully stop the advance of the rot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><sup>- <em>House of the Dragon</em> S01E02 &quot;The Rogue Prince&quot;</sup><br />
Normally, cuts should heal over time and not grow, without the need for cauterization or having maggots eat the dead flesh. It seems that Viserys has a serious disease aggravating his wounds. <strong>What is the nature of King Viserys Targaryen's skin disease?</strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones><house-of-the-dragon>","267277","<p>To further this up now the season is over it would seem that Paddy Considine has answered this in an interview with Entertainment Weekly. In his mind Viserys had leprosy and that was what was causing his deterioration and illness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The weight of the crown is eating away at him, as symbolized in the festering cut Viserys received from sitting the Iron Throne. By episode 3, the king had lost two fingers. That deterioration continues in episode 4 and will continue moving forward. <strong>&quot;He's actually suffering from a form of leprosy,&quot;</strong> Considine says. &quot;His body is deteriorating, his bones are deteriorating. He is not actually old. He's still a young man in there. He's just, unfortunately, got this thing that's taken over his body.

</blockquote>
<p>I will reiterate though, as I do below, that this would appear to mostly be a creation for the TV show and that in the books he weakens more quickly from a few wounds rather than from a disease <em>and</em> several wounds.</p>
<hr />
<p>This would appear to be a slightly different retelling of the story from the books. In the show they seem to be putting emphasis on multiple cuts from the Iron Throne slowly weakening Viserys over time. The wounds shown all seem to come from cutting himself on the Iron Throne and they're just not healing all too well.</p>
<p>In the books all we see is one cut to his hand, but it is pretty bad:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet as he was descending, His Grace stumbled and reached out to right himself, and sliced his left hand open to the bone on a jagged blade protruding from the throne. Though Grand Maester Mellos washed the cut out with boiled wine and bound up the hand with strips of linen soaked in healing ointments, fever soon followed, and many feared the king might die. Only the arrival of Princess Rhaenyra from Dragonstone turned the tide, for with her came her own healer, Maester Gerardys, who acted swiftly to remove two fingers from His Grace’s hand to save his life.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>King Viserys did seem to recover some of his old vigor once the new Grand Maester arrived at court. Septon Eustace tells us that this was the result of prayer, but most believed that Orwyle’s potions and tinctures were more efficacious than the leechings Mellos had preferred. But such recoveries proved short-lived, and gout, chest pains, and shortness of breath continued to trouble the king.</p>
<p><sub><em>Fire and Blood</em>, &quot;Heirs of the Dragon - A Question of Succession&quot;</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This serves two main plot purposes moving forward:</p>
<ol>
<li>It weakens Viserys for his slightly later demise because he never really fully recovers from the wound.</li>
<li>It keeps driving the wedge further between Rhaenyra and Alicent.</li>
</ol>
<p>Essentially if the show continues this line of thought and stays mostly faithful to <em>Fire and Blood</em> the nature of the wounds are exactly what we think they are: just stubborn cuts from the Iron Throne.</p>
<p>To add onto this though from episode 5 we see an illness on Viserys that doesn't appear to be exactly the same as those from the throne wounds. Some have speculated that it is greyscale but that is pretty well known in the Seven Kingdoms and surely the Maesters would not be touching it directly or using leeching to try and heal those wounds. The show itself doesn't really do much here to explain what it is, however, Paddy Considine, the actor for the king, has stated it would appear to be a form of leprosy.</p>

<p>And from way back in A Game of Thrones we know:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> They support Daenerys and Viserys Targaryen. Illyrio hosts them in his mansion for months and then marries Dany to a powerful Khal with an army that can help them regain the Iron Throne. Viserys is also the son of the last Targaryan king, and has a better claim to the throne that any other Targaryans.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it is interesting that according to <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Dance_with_Dragons-Chapter_5"">Chapter 5 of ADWD</a>, </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Illyrio says he had posted guards at Dany's door Viserys might have undone years of planning. Tyrion then comments that Viserys, ""Sounds an utter fool"". To which Illyrio replies, ""Viserys was Mad Aerys' son, just so.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So why do they support both of these people, if the one they favor has the weaker claim?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","63320","<p>The simple answer is: <strong>options</strong>.</p>

<p>Varys has shown that he is an effective, and devious long-term planner.  A large part of his strength in this regard is his ability to adapt to the current situation.</p>

<p>This is crucial to any long-term plans, particularly when it comes to political intrigue.  You can't just pick a plan and hope that nothing goes wrong between now and when you plan on implementing it (especially if it will take decades).  </p>

<p>Strategic board games like Go, Chess and Cyvasse are frequently used as an illustrative analogy for political machinations, and for good reason, as there are several parallels.</p>

<p>Aegon, Daenerys, and Viserys are all important pieces in Varys and Illyrio's game, but until recently, it was too early to bring them into active play.  Prior to that, their strategy was to create a favorable environment, to ready the playing field in such a way as to maximize the value of each of those pieces.</p>

<p>Viserys' weakness was apparent pretty early, but notice how he was used.  Illyrio arranged the wedding of Daenerys to a powerful military force.  Viserys' role was token, at best.  All he really contributed was that he legitimized Daenerys as a princess, making her a more attractive mate for Khal Drogo.</p>

<p>Aegon was actively trained as he grew older, to prepare him to be a useful and skilled asset and/or ruler.</p>

<p>If plans had progressed the way Varys and Illyrio set them up, there would have been two strong Targaryen claimants for the throne (Aegon and Viserys), and they would have been able to pick which was most suited for the situation.</p>

<p>Viserys could have been set up as a decoy, or even something like the Baron Harkonnen's strategy from <em>Dune</em>: Viserys could have been put on the throne, knowing full-well that he was dangerously unstable and would be a terrible leader, but then once the population of the Seven Kingdoms truly came to hate him, he could have been replaced by Aegon, who seems far more capable and charismatic.</p>

<p>However, Varys (and probably Illyrio, as well) is too careful to not account for chance.  He would want backups in case, for example, one of his Targaryen claimants proved dumb enough to provoke a Khal into dumping molten metal over his head.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Do we still consider Edmure's marriage to Roslin valid? After all, I'm not sure a man in his right mind would <em>want</em> to be married to the granddaughter of the architect of the Red Wedding.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","63368","<p>Yes, the wedding is presumably still valid... <strong>if</strong> it was actually consummated (i.e. Edmure and Roslin had sex).</p>

<p>As far as I can recall (and the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Marriage#Legality_and_Annulment"">Wiki of Ice and Fire</a> backs me up), marriage in Westeros generally requires the two participants to willingly exchange vows, and then consummate the marriage in bed.</p>

<p>A wedding that has not been consummated can be annulled.  I believe this came up with the marriage of Tyrion to Sansa, since he did not force her to consummate it.</p>

<p>However, failure to consummate doesn't mean they aren't married, just that it can be dissolved.</p>

<p>They clearly were brought up for the bedding ceremony, although I don't recall if there was any indication of what happened after they were stripped and thrown in the bedroom.  I recall that Roslin was distraught:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Poor Roslin's smile had a fixed quality to it, as if someone had sewn it onto her face.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'To bed! To bed! *To bed with them!' Roslin had gone white.  Catelyn wondered whether it was the prospect of losing her maidenhead that frightened the girl, or the bedding itself.... Catelyn felt sorry for the girl. Most brides tried to return the banter, or at least pretended to enjoy it, but Roslin was stiff with terror, clutching the Greatjon as if she feared he might drop her. <em>She's crying too,</em> Catelyn realized...""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But fear of her grandfather would likely keep her from revealing anything to Edmure, and he certainly seemed willing, and unaware.  So it seems likely the marriage <em>was</em> consummated.</p>

<p>The vows were certainly exchanged, and exchanged willingly, so the circumstances of the later wedding... ""activities""... do not change the status of the marriage.  Only Edmure's opinion of his new family.</p>

<p>I'm looking for a reason for the  difference in the degree of change in personality and memory between people (from an in or out of universe source).

<p>I think that is what changes your personality. That unshakable feeling that you're not whole. He also experiences severe memory loss.</p>

<p>""Can I dwell on what I scarce remember? I held a castle on the Marches once, and there was a woman I was pledged to marry, but I could not find that castle today, nor tell you the color of that woman's hair. Who knighted me, old friend?

</blockquote>

<p>-Game of thrones Wiki</p>

<p>This is likely for the same reasons Beric Dondarrion was different. He doesn't feel whole anymore. But also likely because he was bertrayed by the people he thought he  belonged to and is questioning the meaning of honour.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Later in their childhood, between the ages of 8 and 10, boys – and 
  occasionally girls, too – of knightly and noble status would be sent away to live 
  with another noble family for a few years in a custom called <strong>fostering.</strong> Sometimes 
  the foster family would be related to the birth parents; William Marshal fostered 
  with his cousin William of Tancarville. More often than not, though, foster 
  parents were chosen for political rather than familial connections. The royal 
  household was an especially prestigious place to foster; some royal households 
  had upwards of 100 young men and women in their care. </p>
  
  <p>Fostering helped young nobles make connections with other families while 
  training them in the skills they would need as adult members of the aristocracy. 
  Spending time with young people of a similar age and social class would – or so 
  their parents hoped – strengthen the political bonds among the next generation of 
  the nobility, and maybe even enable them to find a potential spouse. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Lord of the Vale, Jon Arryn was one of the most powerful noblemen in the Seven Kingdoms. On a personal level, he was well known for his wisdom and sense of honour. Therefore, he was a logical choice to foster the sons of similarly powerful families, such as the Starks and Baratheons.</p>

Dismissed on charge of breaking his vow of celibacy and sent to wall after being gelded by <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jaehaerys_I_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow"">Jaehaerys the Conciliator</a> . His dismissal is implied by him being sent to the wall, because according to <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Kingsguard#History"" rel=""nofollow"">Vows of Kingsguard</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>During his time as a member of the Kingsguard, a member is not allowed
  to hold lands, sire children, marry, or <strong>have any worldly allegiance</strong>
  <strong>except to his monarch.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and according to <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Night&#39;s_Watch#Vows"" rel=""nofollow"">vows of Nights Watch</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch</strong>, for this night and
  all the nights to come.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it is clear that you can't be a member of the Kingsguard and Night's Watch at the same time because that would be conflicting with Vows of both the orders. It is also proven because in the aftermath of Robert's Rebellion,  Ned Stark urged Robert Baratheon to send Ser Jaime Lannister to the wall so that he could no longer serve in position of a Kingsguard. Robert however did not heed to his advice and Jaime continued to serve as a KG. If Robert had listened to Eddard Stark, that would have ended Jaime's commision as a KG and opened a vacant post in the KG.</p></li>

<li><p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Boros_Blount"" rel=""nofollow"">Boros Blount</a> dismissed on charge of Cowardice after surrendering Prince Tommen to Tyrion's men. Later reinstated by Lord Tywin. </p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Sandor_Clegane"" rel=""nofollow"">Sandor Clegane</a> aka the Hound. Dismissed after his desertion during <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_the_Blackwater"" rel=""nofollow"">battle of Blackwater Bay</a> and later declared an outlaw. It is implied because after he left, Lord Tywin gave his place to Boros Blount in aftermath of the battle. This handles case of your sub-question about what happens if a KG deserts his duty and flees?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There is case of Ser <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Terrence_Toyne"" rel=""nofollow"">Terrence Toyne</a> as well but he was executed so one can say he  died a KG and wasn't dismissed despite having an affair with <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon_IV_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow"">Aegon</a> the unworthy's <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bethany_Bracken"" rel=""nofollow"">mistress</a>. </p>

"128219","Who is now the Lord of Casterly Rock?","<p>I am re-watching Game of Thrones and I came across this question.</p>

<p>Tywin Lannister is the Lord of Casterly Rock - But since his death, who is now the Lord of Casterly Rock? </p>

<ol>
<li>Tyrion can't be the Lord as he is a fugitive.</li>
<li>Jaime Lannister cannot be the Lord either as he's in the order of the Kingsguards.</li>
<li>There is no indication that it's Cersei.</li>
</ol>

<p>Has this ever been mentioned? I imagine that since Tywin's death, there would be a lot of enemies who will see this as a weakness and try to take this land?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><laws>","128221","<p>Let's begin this answer with <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Category/C91/P210/"" rel=""noreferrer"">a quote from GRRM</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The short answer is that the laws of inheritance in the Seven Kingdoms
  are modelled on those in real medieval history... which is to say,
  they were vague, uncodified, subject to varying interpretations, and
  often contradictory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With that being said, <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Cersei_Lannister"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cersei</a> is the <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/House_Lannister"" rel=""noreferrer"">current Lady paramount of the Westerlands</a> by both the show and the books.</p>

<p><a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Kevan_Lannister"" rel=""noreferrer"">Kevan</a> and his proginy can't ascend to throne of the Kings of the Rock while a Child of Tywin's body is alive and free to claim his/her rights. </p>

<p>Lannisters are Andals who practice faith of seven. According to Andal traditions, rights of a son come before an elder daughter. Similarly rights of a daughter come before rights of an uncle. So the claimants with their number in Line of succession to Throne of Kings of the Rock would be (Ideally):</p>

<p>Jaime can't be lord because of his vows. Tyrion is an attainted traitor and wanted murderer besides. That leaves us with Cersei. With her death, the seat will pass to Tommen No-Kidding-Baratheon unless Tyrion lands in Westeros with Daenerys and makes sure that his sister does die. </p>

<p>In the books, she appoints <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daven_Lannister"" rel=""noreferrer"">one of her cousins</a> as acting Warden of the West and <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Damion_Lannister"" rel=""noreferrer"">another cousin</a> as Castellan of Casterly Rock while she resumes regency of Iron Throne in KL. She refuses to go to Casterly Rock when her uncle reminds her that she is the lady of the Rock and her place is there. </p>

<p>Can't say if they have included this in show but even in show wiki, Cersei is the current lady of Casterly Rock.</p>

  <p> Tommen dismissed Jaime from Service as Kingsguard. He is now eligible
 to inherit the Rock and thus is the heir apparent as per show canon given that Tommen has committed suicide and is thus eliminated from the line. Lancel was also killed in destruction of Sept of Baelor. </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Cersei and Jaime died together along with their unborn baby. Which makes Lord Hand, Tyrion Lannister the last Lannister. Since he was cleared of all crimes and granted the position of the Hand under King Bran, it is evident that he is no longer attainted and is therefore the Rightful Lord of Casterly Rock and Lord Paramount of Westerlands, especially since we have no information otherwise.  </p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I did some further research w.r.t Books in order to find out Lannister claimants other than line of Tytos Lannister and link the other known Lannisters to the line. </p>

<p>Bear in mind that answer above deals only with the Line of Tytos Lannister. </p>

<p>Now moving back in Lannister family tree, We see that Grandfather of Cersei, Jaime and Tyrion, Lord <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tytos_Lannister"" rel=""noreferrer"">Tytos Lannister</a> had another brother named Ser <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jason_Lannister_(son_of_Gerold)"" rel=""noreferrer"">Jason Lannister</a>. </p>

<p>Ser Jason fathered numerous children which include:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Joanna_Lannister"" rel=""noreferrer"">Joanna Lannister</a> who married her cousin, Tywin Lannister. Tywin was at that time heir to the Casterly Rock and Hand of the King. She died giving birth to Tyrion.</li>
<li>Ser <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Stafford_Lannister"" rel=""noreferrer"">Stafford Lannister</a>. He was killed by Lord Rickard Karstark in Battle of Oxcross. </li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Damon_Lannister_(son_of_Jason)"" rel=""noreferrer"">Damon Lannister</a>. It is unknown whether he is alive or dead.</li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lynora_Hill"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lynora Hill</a>. She is presumably alive however it is unknown who she married or if she had children. </li>
<li>2 unnamed sons and 2 unnamed daughters.</li>
</ol>

<p>Joanna, Stafford and Damon all had children and two of them at least had grandchildren. Joanna's children are of course the senior Branch and main line (Jaime, Cersei, Tyrion) along with their own descendants (Tommen and Myrcella).</p>

<p>Children of Stafford and Damon are listed below:</p>

<ol>
<li>Stafford Lannister

<ol>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daven_Lannister"" rel=""noreferrer"">Daven Lannister</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Cerenna_Lannister"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cyrenna Lannister</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Myrielle_Lannister"" rel=""noreferrer"">Myriella Lannister</a></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Damon Lannister

<ol>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Damion_Lannister"" rel=""noreferrer"">Damion Lannister</a>

<ol>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lucion_Lannister"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lucion Lannister</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lanna_Lannister"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lanna Lannister</a></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>Lanna Lannister is married to <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Antario_Jast"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lord Jast</a> and her children are unknown along with children of her cousins.</p>

Whilst the unofficial timeline is one season = one year this doesn't really hold up when you look at some events between seasons. However, seeing as this is the best we really have I shall answer from that perspective.</p>
<p>Daenerys first chains up Viserion and Rhaegal in Season 4 Episode 10, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbXJuPVIxq4"" rel=""noreferrer"">&quot;The Children&quot;</a>, and Tyrion releases them in Season 6 Episode 2, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SIbICzNrBo"" rel=""noreferrer"">&quot;Home&quot;</a>. They then break out of the catacombs in Season 6 Episode 9, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy9_-38j1Fo"" rel=""noreferrer"">&quot;Battle of the Bastards&quot;</a>. The links are to YouTube clips showing these events happening.</p>
<p>Looking at this it would appear that both dragons were locked up for somewhere in between one to two years. Though I'd imagine it is more likely somewhere between the lower half of that estimate.</p>
<h1><em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em></h1>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> We can't know for sure but estimates put it around 6 months.</p>
<p>Before we get into an answer based on the books there are two important things you need to remember. Firstly, sizes and times of locations and events in the books have been left vague on purpose as George does not want people obsessing over these things; that isn't why he wrote the books.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>[How big is Westeros? Is it the size of Europe, or even larger?]</strong></em></p>
<p>I have deliberately tried to be vague about such things, so I don't have obsessive fans with rulers measuring distances on the map and telling me Ned couldn't get from X to Y in the time I say he did.</p>
<p>However, if you really must know, you can figure out the distances for yourself. The Wall is a hundred leagues long. A league is three miles. Go from there.</p>
<p>But if you turn up any mistakes in travel times by using that measure, let it be your secret.</p>
<p><sub><a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Size_of_Westeros/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Westeros, So Spake Martin, Size of Westeros</a></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then when looking into the writing itself George believes in using the &quot;unreliable narrator&quot;. In the same way as when you look back in history events might not be described exactly the same as what happens, the same happens in the books. The chapters are told from the point of view of characters and so events may be mis-remembered or interpreted differently between characters and at different times.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was a long discussion about mistakes and inconsistencies. He used the eyes changing color example, and also mentioned receiving an email about horses changing sex. George gets frustrated when there's mistakes in the books--not just because mistakes can be embarrassing, though. He said there are inconsistencies in the books that are NOT mistakes. He believes in the &quot;unreliable narrator&quot; -- you can't always trust what people say because they might be remembering it wrong, or you get two different stories depending on who's doing the telling. He feels that mistakes such as eye color changes can distract from the planned inconsistencies, making them less effective.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>So when measuring times in Westeros we need to know a relative scale for how long a year/month is. Whilst we have no exact timing for a month except they are measured in &quot;moon turns&quot; (how long is a moon turn? We don't know, likely the same as ours though ~30 days), we do know a year consists of twelve moon turns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>[What is the cycle of a year? Why do they count years when seasons are strange?]</strong></em></p>
<p>Twelve moon tuns to a year, as on earth. Even on our earth, years have nothing to do with the seasons, or with the cycles of the moon. A year is a measure of a solar cycle, of how long it takes the earth to make one complete revolution around the sun. The same is true for the world of Westeros. Seasons do not come into it.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I have yet to properly double check, looking at other events in it, it does appear to be accurate, but <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZsY3lcDDtTdBWp1Gx6mfkdtZT6-Gk0kdTGeSC_Dj7WM/edit#gid=8"" rel=""noreferrer"">this timeline</a> for the whole series puts it around 6 months. <em>A Dance with Dragons</em> takes place solely in the year 300 AC so we already have an upper bound for the time they were placed in chains of a year.</p>
<p>Daenerys originally chains up Viserion and Rhaegal in &quot;Daenerys II&quot; of the book. The mentioned timeline puts this at the start of the year, the twentieth of the first month.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Viserion's claws scrabbled against the stones, and the huge chains rattled as he tried to make his way to her again. When he could not, he gave a roar, twisted his head back as far as he was able, and spat golden flame at the wall behind him. How soon till his fire burns hot enough to crack stone and melt iron?</p>
<p>Once, not long ago, he had ridden on her shoulder, his tail coiled round her arm. Once she had fed him morsels of charred meat from her own hand. He had been the first chained up. Daenerys had led him to the pit herself and shut him up inside with several oxen. Once he had gorged himself he grew drowsy. They had chained him whilst he slept.</p>
<p>Rhaegal had been harder. Perhaps he could hear his brother raging in the pit, despite the walls of brick and stone between them. In the end, they had to cover him with a net of heavy iron chain as he basked on her terrace, and he fought so fiercely that it had taken three days to carry him down the servants' steps, twisting and snapping. Six men had been burned in the struggle.</p>
<p><sub><em>A Dance with Dragons</em>, Daenerys II</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quentyn Martell later tries to tame and steal one of the dragons for himself, in the process they manage to escape; this happens in &quot;The Dragontamer&quot;. However, the dragons are seen to be free in &quot;The Queen's Hand&quot; by Ser Barristan Selmy having escaped during the aftermath of the previous mentioned event. The timeline puts this event at the fifteenth day of the seventh month.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He took his last shuddering breath in the bleak black dawn, as cold rain hissed from a dark sky to turn the brick streets of the old city into rivers. The rain had drowned the worst of the fires, but wisps of smoke still rose from the smoldering ruin that had been the pyramid of Hazkar, and the great black pyramid of Yherizan where Rhaegal had made his lair hulked in the gloom like a fat woman bedecked with glowing orange jewels.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Ser Barristan went out onto the terrace. The rain had stopped, though a wall of slate-grey clouds hid the setting sun as it made its descent into Slaver's Bay. A few wisps of smoke still rose from the blackened stones of Hazdar, twisted like ribbons by the wind. Far off to the east, beyond the city walls, he saw pale wings moving above a distant line of hills. Viserion. Hunting, mayhaps, or flying just to fly. He wondered where Rhaegal was. Thus far the green dragon had shown himself to be more dangerous than the white.</p>
<p><sub><em>A Dance with Dragons</em>, The Queen's Hand</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taking these times together the difference is 5 months, 3 weeks, 4 days from our calendar. This would then be ~6 months when we take into account an error margin and the fact that Westerosi months aren't exactly the same as ours.</p>

"194671","Was Brienne of Tarth a better fighter than Ser Jaime Lannister?","<p>I have not read the books.</p>

<p>In one of the episodes of season 2 of the TV series two guards are discussing who among Ser Loras, Ser Jaime and The Mountain is the better fighter. One of them claims Ser Loras to be the best, To which the other one replies ""He's been stabbing Renly Baratheon for years but he's not dead!"" - or something on that line - to which both of them burst out laughing. </p>

<p>In a separate scene (probably different episode) where Brienne of Tarth is introduced in the series she defeats Ser Loras in a melee which takes place in front of their king Renly Baratheon, as a result of which he makes her a member of his Kingsguard.</p>

<p>From the above two scenes I feel that Brienne is better than Ser Loras and probably Ser Jaime too.</p>

<p>Is it true? How is it shown in the books?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","194680","<p>No Brienne is not a better fighter than Jaime Lannister.</p>
<p>Brienne and Jaime fought each other while she was escorting him to King's Landing. Jaime at that point was handcuffed and starved for weeks yet he put up hell of a fight.</p>
<p>But Personally Jaime came to realise she was much stronger than him, while Brienne reached the conclusion that in a fair fight, Nobody stood a chance against the Young Lion.</p>
<p>This is how it went from Jaime's POV:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the blade slid from the scabbard, <strong>he was already pivoting,
bringing the sword around and up in a swift deadly arc</strong>. Steel met
steel with a ringing, bone-jarring clang. <strong>Somehow Brienne had gotten
her own blade out in time</strong>. Jaime laughed. “Very good, wench.”</p>
<p>“Give me the sword, Kingslayer.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I will.” He sprang to his feet and drove at her, the longsword
alive in his hands. Brienne jumped back, parrying, but he followed,
pressing the attack. No sooner did she turn one cut than the next was
upon her. The swords kissed and sprang apart and kissed again.
<strong>Jaime’s blood was singing. This was what he was meant for; he never felt so alive</strong> as when he was fighting, with death balanced on every
stroke. <strong>And with my wrists chained together, the wench may even give
me a contest for a time.</strong> His chains forced him to use a two-handed
grip, though of course the weight and reach were less than if the
blade had been a true two-handed greatsword, but what did it matter?
His cousin’s sword was long enough to write an end to this Brienne of
Tarth.</p>
<p>High, low, overhand, he rained down steel upon her. Left, right,
backslash, swinging so hard that sparks flew when the swords came
together, upswing, sideslash, overhand, always attacking, moving into
her, step and slide, strike and step, step and strike, hacking,
slashing, faster, faster, faster...</p>
<p>... <strong>until, breathless, he stepped back and let the point of the
sword fall to the ground, giving her a moment of respite. “Not half
bad,” he acknowledged. “For a wench.”</strong></p>
<p>She took a slow deep breath, her eyes watching him warily. <strong>“I would
not hurt you, Kingslayer.”</strong></p>
<p>“As if you could.” He whirled the blade back up above his head and
flew at her again, chains rattling.</p>
<p>Jaime could not have said how long he pressed the attack. It might
have been minutes or it might have been hours; time slept when swords
woke. He drove her away from his cousin’s corpse, drove her across the
road, drove her into the trees. <strong>She stumbled once on a root she
never saw, and for a moment he thought she was done</strong>, but she went to
one knee instead of falling, and never lost a beat. <strong>Her sword leapt
up to block a downcut that would have opened her from shoulder to
groin</strong>, and then she cut at him, again and again, <strong>fighting her way
back to her feet stroke by stroke</strong>.</p>
<p>The dance went on. He pinned her against an oak, cursed as she slipped
away, followed her through a shallow brook half-choked with fallen
leaves. Steel rang, steel sang, steel screamed and sparked and
scraped, and the <strong>woman started grunting like a sow at every crash,
yet somehow he could not reach her. It was as if she had an iron cage
around her that stopped every blow.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Not bad at all,”</strong> he said when he paused for a second to catch his breath, circling to her right. “For a wench?”</p>
<p><strong>“For a squire, say. A green one.”</strong> He laughed a ragged, breathless laugh.  “Come on, come on, my sweetling, the music’s still playing.
Might I have this dance, my lady?”</p>
<p>Grunting, <strong>she came at him, blade whirling, and suddenly it was Jaime
struggling to keep steel from skin. One of her slashes raked across
his brow, and blood ran down into his right eye.</strong> The Others take
her, and Riverrun as well! <strong>His skills had gone to rust and rot in
that bloody dungeon, and the chains were no great help either</strong>. His
eye closed, his shoulders were going numb from the jarring they’d
taken, and his wrists ached from the weight of chains, manacles, and
sword. <strong>His longsword grew heavier with every blow</strong>, and Jaime knew
he was not swinging it as quickly as he’d done earlier, nor raising it
as high.</p>
<p><strong>She is stronger than I am. The realization chilled him.</strong> Robert had been stronger than him, to be sure. The White Bull Gerold Hightower as
well, in his heyday, and Ser Arthur Dayne. Amongst the living,
Greatjon Umber was stronger, Strongboar of Crakehall most likely, both
Cleganes for a certainty. The Mountain's strength was like nothing
human. It did not matter. With speed and skill, Jaime could beat them
all. But this was a woman. A huge cow of a woman, to be sure, but even
so . . . by rights, she should be the one wearing down.</p>
<p>Instead she forced him back into the brook again, shouting, “Yield!
Throw down the sword!”</p>
<p>A slick stone turned under Jaime’s foot. <strong>As he felt himself falling,
he twisted the mischance into a diving lunge. His point scraped past
her parry and bit into her upper thigh</strong>. A red flower blossomed, and
<strong>Jaime had an instant to savor the sight of her blood</strong> before his knee slammed into a rock. The pain was blinding. <strong>Brienne splashed
into him and kicked away his sword. “YIELD!”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jaime drove his shoulder into her legs, bringing her down on top of him. They rolled, kicking and punching</strong> until finally she was sitting
astride him. <strong>He managed to jerk her dagger from its sheath, but
before he could plunge it into her belly she caught his wrist and
slammed his hands back on a rock so hard he thought she’d wrenched an
arm from its socket</strong>. Her other hand spread across his face. “Yield!”
She shoved his head down, held it under, pulled it up. “Yield!” Jaime
spit water into her face. A shove, a splash, and he was under again,
kicking uselessly, fighting to breathe. Up again. “Yield, or I’ll
drown you!”<br><sub><strong>ASOS - Jaime III</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So this is how it happened for Jaime. He began with utmost derision for Brienne and thought he could have beaten her even if he was chained at hands and starved. Brienne's fighting skills made him realise she was a good fighter <em>for a woman</em>. The dance kept moving and he then admitted that she was good enough <em>for a squire</em>. It was just before the end that he realised that she was stronger than him. Although I think he was actually so rattled to be bested by her that he forgot to really consider how much at a disadvantage was he. In an equal fight, as Brienne herself assessed, He would have killed her. Another curious thing to note is how Jaime appears to be in denial by the end, he believed it was not Brienne's skills but rather her strength and that his skills had gone to rust while imprisoned, that was making him lose. Holding off a Swordsman as skilled as Jaime, even at a disadvantage, requires a certain level of skill.</p>
<p>Brienne had (While noting the crucial factors that Jaime was weakened and handcuffed, severely limiting his moves) good reflexes, as Jaime noted happily in the beginning. She brought out her own sword and deflected Jaime's surprise attack just in time. She also had good defensive skills. She skilfully parried each and every attack Jaime launched in the beginning when Jaime was not tired. Nor did she lack for the resolve to keep fighting. Jaime's attack forced her to her knees yet she made her fall a renewed attack. Jaime pinned her against the trees and yet she escaped the deathblow. After that, it was her on the offensive and Jaime on the defensive. This was after all, how she was taught to fight.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ser Goodwin had taught her to fight cautiously, to conserve her
strength while letting her foes spend theirs in furious attacks. &quot;<strong>Men
will always underestimate you</strong>,&quot; he said, &quot;<strong>and their pride will make
them want to vanquish you quickly, lest it be said that a woman tried
them sorely</strong>.&quot; She had learned the truth of that once she went into the
world. <strong>Even Jaime Lannister had come at her that way</strong>, in the woods by
Maidenpool. If the gods were good, the Mad Mouse would make the same
mistake. He may be a seasoned knight, she thought, but he is no Jaime Lannister<br><sub><strong>AFFC: Brienne II</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She seems to be holding back a bit as she said she didn't want to hurt Jaime but that couldn't have possibly lasted for long given the ferocity of Jaime's attack. It could be a mixture of both her training and her oath that caused her to remain on the defensive for most part until she saw Jaime was completely exhausted.</p>
<p>Jaime came to give her the respect she deserved by the time they reached King's Landing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ser Loras edged around him. &quot;Are you a craven as well as a killer, Brienne? Is that why you ran, with his blood on your hands? <strong>Draw your sword, woman!</strong>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>Best hope she doesn't</strong>.&quot; Jaime blocked his path again. &quot;<strong>Or it's like to be your corpse we carry out. The wench is as strong as Gregor Clegane, though not so pretty.</strong>&quot;<br><sub><strong>ASOS - Jaime VII</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brienne's own thoughts on the fight went like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Brienne remembered her fight with Jaime Lannister in the woods. <strong>It had been all that she could do to keep his blade at bay. He was weak from his imprisonment, and chained at the wrists. No knight in the Seven Kingdoms could have stood against him at his full strength, with no chains to hamper him</strong>. Jaime had done many wicked things, but the man could fight! His maiming had been monstrously cruel. It was one thing to slay a lion, another to hack his paw off and leave him broken and bewildered.<br><sub><strong>AFFC - Brienne I</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brienne was better than most knights of Westeros but Jaime Lannister was not most Knights. He was one of those exceptional natural swordsmen who come about in a century or so. Ser Barristan Selmy thought so about Jaime and that says something.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of them had been training for the fighting pits when Daenerys
Targaryen took Meereen and freed them from their chains. Those had had
a good acquaintance with sword and spear and battle-axe even before
Ser Barristan got hold of them. A few might well be ready. The boy
from the Basilisk Isles, for a start. Tumco Lho. <strong>Black as maester's
ink he was, but fast and strong, the best natural swordsman Selmy had
seen since Jaime Lannister.</strong><br><sub><strong>ADWD - The Kingbreaker</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the show however, they made it look like as if Brienne was simply holding back to keep her oath and easily defeated Jaime whereas it was a very close thing in the books. Jaime fell when a slick stone got in the way, turned it into a lunge, drew her blood but then was disarmed by Brienne. That didn't stop the fight either, Jaime brought Brienne down with her and they had a fist-to-fist fight and Jaime almost drove her own dagger into her, which is when she finally overpowered him and the Brave Companions caught up with them.</p>

            </div></div></p>
<p>As to how did that specific encounter between Brienne and Loras turned out in the books, this is how it went (The Blue Knight in the excerpt is Brienne):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The blue knight let his broken shield drop to the ground to free his
left arm, and then the Knight of Flowers was on him. The weight of his
steel seemed to hardly diminish the grace and quickness with which Ser
Loras moved, his rainbow cloak swirling about him.</p>
<p>The white horse and the black one wheeled like lovers at a harvest
dance, the riders throwing steel in place of kisses. Longaxe flashed
and morningstar whirled. Both weapons were blunted, yet still they
raised an awful clangor. Shieldless, the blue knight was getting much
the worse of it. Ser Loras rained down blows on his head and
shoulders, to shouts of “Highgarden!” from the throng. The other gave
answer with his morningstar, but whenever the ball came crashing in,
Ser Loras interposed his battered green shield, emblazoned with three
golden roses. When the longaxe caught the blue knight’s hand on the
backswing and sent the morningstar flying from his grasp, the crowd
screamed like a rutting beast. The Knight of Flowers raised his axe
for the final blow.</p>
<p>The blue knight charged into it. The stallions slammed together, the
blunted axehead smashed against the scarred blue breastplate... but
somehow the blue knight had the haft locked between steel-gauntleted
fingers. He wrenched it from Ser Loras’s hand, and suddenly the two
were grappling mount-to-mount, and an instant later they were falling.
As their horses pulled apart, they crashed to the ground with
bone-jarring force. Loras Tyrell, on the bottom, took the brunt of the
impact. The blue knight pulled a long dirk free and flicked open
Tyrell’s visor. The roar of the crowd was too loud for Catelyn to hear
what Ser Loras said, but she saw the word form on his split, bloody
lips. Yield.<br><sub><strong>ACOK - Catelyn II</strong></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Renly did raise Brienne to the Kingsguard when she requested that honour as her prize. Some Tyrell men however claimed that Brienne's pulled a vile trick in pulling Loras down from his horse like that and it was no proper unhorsing.</p>

"128261","Do the faceless men serve the ""Great Other"", R'hllor's rival?","<p>It seems to be the case. Melisandre was deeply disturbed by the great darkness in Arya. Regarding the Great Other, she mentions that ""Death is his domain, the dead his soldiers."", which seems to fit with the many-faced god. </p>

<p>Also, it would fit in nicely with fact that J=Azor Ahai allowing for an epic confrontation in the future.</p>

<p>*I've checked the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Great_Other"" rel=""noreferrer"">wiki</a> but it doesn't provide much detail.</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","128286","<h2>Who are Faceless Men?</h2>

<p>The Faceless men serve <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Many-Faced_God"" rel=""nofollow"">The Many Faced God</a>. Their belief is that all men are right about Gods but no matter what they call their God, he is actually the one with many faces, who shall welcome every man at the end of his days. So basically their belief is that Yitish god Lion of Night, Westerosi god The Stranger, Black Goat of Qohor are all the different names of one God, him of the many faces. </p>

<p>The tale of TFLM's beginnings centers around a figure of unknown origins who was the first Faceless Man. This man heard the prayers of the slaves to their various gods and came to conclude that they all prayed to the same god ""with a hundred different faces"", the Many-Faced God, and that he was ""that god's instrument"". This led to him giving ""the first gift"" to the most desperate slave.</p>

<p>By this account we can estimate date for establishment of the Facelessmen order to the Rise of Valyrian Freehold. However we do know that <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Long_Night"" rel=""nofollow"">the Long Night</a> was long time before Valyrians rose with their dragons. Long Night was about 8000 years before the conquest and <s>while we do not know when did Valyrian Freehold establish itself</s>, Valyrian freehold <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Timeline_of_major_events"" rel=""nofollow"">established itself 5000 years before the conquest</a> and we do know that it reached zenith of its power in about 950 years before Conquest when they fought in Rhoynish wars. Therefore the order can't be the soldiers of the Great other because Valyria was formed 3,000 years after Long Night and FLM were formed even after that.</p>

<p>Also Faceless men do not kill for their own desire or for fun (or for a secret genocidal mission) which is what Arya Stark is having a hard time to understand.</p>

<h2>Are they soldiers of The Great Other?</h2>

<p>When Melisandre makes this statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Death is <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Great_Other"" rel=""nofollow"">his</a> domain, the dead his soldiers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She is not referring to The Faceless men. </p>

<p>Faceless men are most certainly not dead and thus do not qualify for being soldiers of the great Other. Also while they do have death as their domain, they grant it as a gift, not out of hatred for everything with warm blood as <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Wights"" rel=""nofollow"">Wights</a> and <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Others"" rel=""nofollow"">others</a> do. </p>

<p>AWOIAF Wiki defines Wights as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Wights are <strong>dead men</strong> or creatures raised up by the Others, seemingly
  when touched by the cold that accompanies them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those are your dead soldiers. </p>

<p>The Others themselves however are not dead. As George R.R. Martin <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Others"" rel=""nofollow"">said</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Others are not dead. They are strange, beautiful… think, oh… the
  Sidhe made of ice, something like that… a different sort of life…
  inhuman, elegant, dangerous.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Evidence Against</h2>

<ol>
<li>Order did not exist during the time of the Long Night which was 8000 years before Aegon's Conquest of Westeros. Order was founded during reign of the Valyrian Freehold which was few thousand years after the long Night.</li>
<li>The members of the order are not dead and thus Wights fit Mel's description in a better way. If Mel suspected that, she would not have crossed the narrow sea to fight the war for light, she would have gone to Braavos which was more convenient to her. </li>
<li>Order does not kill people for their own desire or just for the sake of it. Nor do they do it out of hatred or enchantment. They do it as a mercy and a gift.</li>

  <p> wedding of fake Arya at Winterfell.</p>

<p>What happened to him and his companions?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","63830","<p>As copied from the theory section of the wikipedia at Westeros.org, the Theory of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Frey_Pies/Theories"">the Frey Pies</a></p>

<p>-- start --</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>The best pie you have ever tasted, my lords. Wash it down with Arbor gold and savor every bite. I know I shall.</em></p>
  
  <p>-- Wyman Manderly during the wedding of fake ""Arya Stark""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Frey Pies Theory is that Wyman Manderly killed the three Freys (Rhaegar, Symond, and Jared) who disappeared on the way from White Harbor to Winterfell and baked them into the three huge meat pies he brought for Ramsay Bolton's wedding at Winterfell.
Supporting Evidence</p>

<ul>
<li>Lord Wyman suggests to Davos Seaworth he means to have all three Freys murdered and intimates about giving a guest gift to the Freys in line with their house's breach of guest right at the Red Wedding.</li>
<li>Roose Bolton suspects Lord Wyman had the Freys killed while on the road from White Harbor to Winterfell. Lord Wyman insists the Freys travelled ahead of his column out of impatience over Wyman's slow pace. While not implausible, this is a very flimsy story.</li>
<li>Lord Wyman presents 3 huge pies at the wedding, one for each of the missing Freys.</li>
<li>When the pies are served at the wedding, Lord Wyman cuts portions personally for the Boltons and Freys, to ensure they would eat it. He serves them with great (drunken) exuberance.</li>
<li>At the wedding, Lord Wyman has Abel the Bard sing the Rat Cook for them, a song about an evil cook who kills a prince and bakes him into a pie he then serves to the king. Shortly after Bran dreamed Robb's death, he reflected on the legend of the Rat Cook: he was transformed into a giant white rat by the gods, not because of his deeds, but specifically because he dishonoured guest right. </li>
</ul>

<p>-- end copy --</p>

<p>I have also heard it mentioned that during this feast and the questioning about the missing Freys, Lord Wyman said ""mayhaps"" several times. The use of the word ""mayhaps"" is a part of a children's game the Freys play (the lord of the crossing) where you are allowed to lie, as long as you include the word ""mayhaps"" in what you say.</p>

<p>The evidence is not overwhelming, but when you read the book with this in mind, it becomes rather more apparent that this is what happened, in my opinion. Especially considering the anger Lord Wyman shows when talking to Davos.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ""They watch me, ser. Day and night their eyes are on me, noses sniffing for some whiff of treachery. You saw them, the arrogant Ser Jared and his nephew Rhaegar, that smirking worm who wears a dragon's name. Behind them both stands Symond, clinking coins. That one has bought and paid for several of my servants and two of my knights. One of his wife's handmaids has found her way into the bed of my own fool. If Stannis wonders that my letters say so little, it is because I dare not even trust my maester. Theomore is all head and no heart. You heard him in my hall. Maesters are supposed to put aside old loyalties when they don their chains, but I cannot forget that Theomore was born a Lannister of Lannisport and claims some distant kinship to the Lannisters of Castlerly Rock. Foes and false friends are all around me, Lord Davos. They infest my city like roaches, and at night I feel them crawling over me."" The fat man's fingers coiled into a fist, and all his chins trembled. ""My son Wendel came to the Twins a guest. He ate Lord Walder's bread and salt, and hung his sword upon the wall to feast with friends. And they murdered him. <em>Murdered</em>, I say, and may the Freys choke upon their fables. I drink with Jared, jape with Symond, promise Rhaegar the hand of my own beloved granddaughter... but never think that means I have forgotten. <strong>The north remembers, Lord Davos. The north remembers, and the mummer's farce is almost done.</strong> My son is home.""<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; Something about the way Lord Wyman said that chilled Davos to the bone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And later:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; My body has become a prison more dire than the Wolf's Den. Even so, I must go to Winterfell. Roose Bolton wants me on my knees, and beneath the velvet courtesy he shows the iron mail. I shall go by barge and litter, attended by a hundred knights and my good friends from the Twins. The Freys came here by sea. They have no horses with them, so I shall present each of them with a palfrey as a guest gift. Do hosts still give guest gifts in the south?""<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; ""Some do, my lord. On the day their guest departs.""<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; ""Perhaps you understand, then.""</p>

"128367","Why does Daario smash the dead Dothraki's head in with a rock?","<p>I understand that in Vaes Dothrak, weapons are forbidden, but isn't bloodshed also forbidden? Did they just mess this up, because later on in the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen, the blood rider mentions this to Khal Moro (about bloodshed being forbidden), and he is dismissive of it. </p>

<p>So did Daario read Khal Moro's mind in advance to know he wouldn't care about bloodshed, and hence the rock smashing? </p>

<p>Or did he smash the guy's head in because he was unaware of the bloodshed rule? (Which would make no sense because Jorah would know this and would've told him before he started bashing the dead guys head in).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You all right? If they find a body <strong>with a stab wound, the whole city

<p>Assuming that bloodshed is prohibited in Vaes Dothrak, getting into a fistfight and killing someone may be technically disallowed, but it is something a sufficiently foolish or drunk resident may do. <strong>Killing someone with a <em>blade</em>, given that weapons are prohibited within the city? Clearly the work of a foreigner, and thus of high priority.</strong></p>
<p>A death via blunt force trauma will undoubtedly be looked into, but perhaps not with the same urgency. Thus the need to conceal the cause of death.</p>
<h2>The rules against bloodshed may not be so hard-and-fast</h2>
<p>In the novels, it is established that any sort of bloodshed (of humans, at least) is prohibited, along with bladed steel weapons.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of the men were drunk on clotted mare's milk, yet Daenerys knew no
<em>arakhs</em> would clash tonight, not here in the sacred city, where blades and bloodshed were forbidden.</p>
<p>—<em>A Game of Thrones</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the TV show, people generally speak of the ban on weapons when they mention Vaes Dothrak:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JORAH MORMONT: Don't let them see you carrying a sword in Vaes
Dothrak. You know the law.</p>
<p>VISERYS TARGARYEN: (sheaths his sword) It's
not my law.(turns and puts another egg in the bag)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's forbidden <strong>to carry weapons</strong> in the sacred city.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You all right? If they find a body <strong>with a stab wound</strong>, the whole city
will be looking for us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, Viserys Targaryen does not (though admittedly he is an individual with perhaps not a stellar understanding of Dothraki culture, as evidenced by his final fate):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>VISERYS TARGARYEN: They can't kill us. (pointing his sword again at
Jorah) (Drogo mutters to his Dothraki soldier, who then gets up) They
can't shed blood in their sacred city.</p>

<p>Indeed, <a href=""http://dedalvs.tumblr.com/post/144459011173/dothraki-and-valyrian-dialogue-episode-604-of"" rel=""noreferrer"">the translation of the Dothraki dialogue</a> from the episode makes the reasoning clear:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>FORZHO : It is forbidden to spill blood in the sacred city.</p>
<p>MORO: It is forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city.</p>
<p>FORZHO: So we don’t spill blood!</p>
<p>MORO: Well… There’s always a little blood.</p>
<p>FORZHO: Not when you strangle them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems that not all the Dothraki practice the prohibition on spilling blood so firmly, and that bloodshed through non-weapon means is not unheard of (not surprising, given how many Dothraki fetishize violence elsewhere).</p>
<p><strong>So while avoiding spilling blood may be the point of the prohibition on weapons, some Dothraki seem to interpret the prohibition rather literally.</strong> Of course, this still probably wouldn't let someone get away with the murder of a prominent individual, but as mentioned previously, it would make the death much less suspicious.</p>

"128404","Who is responsible for Stannis's debt to the Iron Bank?","<p><strong>Spoilers ahead for anyone not caught up to Season 6 of Game of Thrones</strong></p>

<p>In season 4 of the TV show, Stannis travels to Braavos to take a loan from the Iron Bank to get the forces he needs to conquer Westeros. In this conversation the Iron Bankers, initially dismissive of Stannis, are convinced by Davos that Stannis is the only one who will pay back the debts that the Iron Throne owes to the bank.</p>

<p>Here in an except from the <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Stannis_Baratheon"">Game of Thrones Wiki</a> relating to Season 4:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> After being granted an audience with the Iron Bank of Braavos, Stannis and Davos travel to Braavos where they meet with Tycho Nestoris. Although at first dismissive of Stannis' claim due to his inferior army and his lack of resources to repay any debts to Bank, Davos defends Stannis as the only one able to repay the debts, both that he takes and those of the Iron Throne. Davos' plea insists that Stannis always pays up and that the Lannisters will be faced with a power vacuum when Tywin Lannister (who is 67 years old) dies and that, if such a moment occurred, the Bank wasn't likely to see a return on its investment in Westeros. The bankers decide to grant Stannis his loan and their support, allowing Davos to once again hire Salladhor Saan into their service.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now at the end of Season 5:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>Stannis was defeated by the Boltons and executed by Brienne of Tarth. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>So now that the above has happened, what happens to the debt that Stannis owes the Iron Bank? Does it shift to another Baratheon house or do the bankers consider their investment a loss?</strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones>","128409","<p>It would seem that the Iron Bank will finance many competitors to ultimately receive a return on investment. The slogan most associated with them is ""The Iron Bank will have its due."".</p>

<p>The Crown is highly in debt to the bank. We see this in two instances 1) when Ned Stark takes over as Hand, and 2) when Tyrion takes over for Littlefinger as Master of Coin and in going through the accounting finds this. In fact, the Crown owes three million to the Lannisters, one million to the Faith, and two million to the Tyrells, Iron Bank and several Tyroshi trading cartels combined. </p>

<p>The Lannisters are not going to be calling on their debt seeing as their (extended) family is on the Throne. Cersei abates the debt to Faith by appointing the High Sparrow as the High Septon and allowing the rearming of the Faith Militant. The Tyrells are in the same position as the Lannisters....</p>

<p>This leaves the Iron Bank as the only powerful group unpaid, and it seems the the Crown can not or will not make the payments.</p>

<p>IIRC, the Iron Bank has been known to hire the Second Sons and Faceless Men to collect from those who do not pay their loans back. However, the Seven Kingdoms are too large for those groups to directly challenge. </p>

<p>This leaves Stannis as he really does have the strongest claim to the throne, if one believes Robert's children were not his. Also, he would be fresh blood on the throne and the Bank would have a direct recourse to collect ALL of the Crown's debt. In the books, a member of the Bank follows Stannis to the wall to constantly remind him of the loan. </p>

<p>Now that Stannis has failed,  <strong>There is no one to collect his debt from</strong>. Stannis left no wife, no children, <strong>his line is extinguished</strong>. <strong>The bank made a bad investment</strong> but will probably look to another claiming the Throne. This may end up being a few different claimants...</p>

"128476","Where was the kingsguard during the sack of King's Landing?","<p>The seven knights of the Kingsguard were stationed in different locations during the last days of King Aerys II. Gerold Hightower, Oswell Whent, and Arthur Dayne were stationed at the Tower of Joy, and later on killed there. Jaime Lannister was in King's Landing with Aerys. Barristan Selmy was at the battle on the Trident. I believe that Jon Darry was also on the Trident. I assume that Darry was killed during the battle, as I can only remember that Selmy surrendered. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Who was the last member of the Kingsguard, where was he at that time, and what happened to him? Was he with the king's wife on Dragonstone? As far as I know, beside slaying Aerys, Jaime only killed the pyromancer Rossart and not one of his Kingsguard brothers. </p>

<p>The reason I'm asking is that I am confused whether the King was only protected by one member of the Kingsguard. </p>

"128510","The number of soldiers each house can rally","<p>Now that we might see some Vale action, I really wonder the number of soldiers each house can muster. There is a comprehensive semi-canon source for this question: <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Armies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Armies</a></p>

<p>However, I am seeking a canon answer. By canon, I mean the books (<em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>) first. The series (<em>Game of Thrones</em>) are also welcome if they do not directly contradict with the books. I am seeking information of the following sort:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Northern host was about 20000-25000 when they leave Moat Cailin.</li>
<li>Rodrik Cassel gathered more than 2000 when Winterfell was invaded by Theon.</li>
<li>They were attacked by about 400 soldiers from Dreadfort.</li>
<li>Stannis had about 2500-3000 soldiers from the mountain clans.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, the North must have around 25000-30000 soldiers at the least.</p>

<p>We have some direct information as well: Dorne called her banners and mustered 50000 spears, according to the books. The Twins had 4000 soldiers.</p>

<p>Do we have canon information, similar to what I have provided for the rest of the great houses and the Crownlands? <s>Great or small houses are welcome.</s></p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","138809","<p><strong>About 15-30 thousand troops each.</strong></p>

<p>It depends on the House, the war, number of sell-swords available and the current conditions, but in general, as you noted in your question, most of the Great Houses can field roughly 15 to 30 thousand men.</p>

</ul>

<p>It's not very important to the story <strong>exactly</strong> how many men were fielded by each army; only that they matched with most differences being minor ones. Some had more horses, some more spearmen, etc.</p>

<p>The point of talking about massive armies was to give a sense of the scale, as well as to highlight the tactics used within the battles.</p>

<p>For examply, Robb Stark's army was outnumbered by Tywin's, yet he used his cunning to overcome them in his battles.</p>

<p>The author, George R. R. Martin, has said on multiple occasions that he likes to keep exact details such as dates, timelines, numbers and distances intentionally vague. It is hard to keep up with, and also doesn't necessarily add a huge amount to the plot.</p>

"64004","Why did Melisandre not die by the poison in ACoK?","<p>In the prologue of A Clash of Kings, Maester Cressen tries to assassinate Melisandre with a cup of wine poisoned with <em>the strangler</em>.
Melisandre seems to be aware of the poison and offers him to spill the wine, but Maester Cressen insists.
She then drinks most of the wine, but leaves some for Maester Cressen, who drinks the rest.
Melisandre is unaffected by the poison.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""He <em>does</em> have power here, my lord,"" the woman said. ""And fire
  cleanses."" At her throat, the ruby shimmered redly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After that, Maester Cressen dies of the poisoned wine.</p>

<p>We have seen Melisandre do some pretty impressive stuff (give birth to the shadow baby), but some of her powers have also been attributed to <em>using the right powders and glamours</em>.</p>

<p>Has it ever been explained how Melisandre survived the poison?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","64012","<p>The exact reason is never mentioned, although we can glean some understanding from Melisandre's thoughts to herself in <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Dance_with_Dragons-Chapter_31"" rel=""nofollow"">ADWD Chapter 31</a>:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">

<p>Finally, there is this thought by Dany in <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Clash_of_Kings-Chapter_40"" rel=""nofollow"">ACOK Chapter 40</a> that mentions an enchanted necklace being able to protect against poisons: </p>

"195028","Why were there so many willing accomplices to the Red Wedding?","<p>My question, which I think is agnostic between the <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> and <em>Game of Thrones</em>, is regarding the &quot;guest right&quot; social rule. A lot of online material on GoT stresses how sacred guest right is in the GoT universe, and that every major religion holds it as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>one of the most sacred and inviolable social rules</p>
<p><sub><a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Guest_right"" rel=""noreferrer"">Game of Thrones wikia, Guest right</a></sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Red Wedding (Season 3 Episode 9, &quot;The Rains of Castamere&quot;) had a lot of participants: Walder Frey himself, but also the archers and soldiers who slit throats, Roose Bolton, and others.</p>
<p>I could see Walder Frey himself willing to break a social rule as sacred as guest right: from rage, possibly madness (as suggested here: <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/80276/are-the-red-wedding-motives-ever-explained"">Are the Red Wedding motives ever explained?</a>), and maybe to spite the gods thereby - but would there be so many accomplices willing to break guest right if breakers are considered scorned or due for the gods' wrath?</p>
<p>I'm specifically wondering does guest right apply only to a single host, A &quot;head of household&quot;? Is that how footmen who carried out the killings might have justified that they themselves were not breaking guest right? Or is the GoT world sort of like ours, where some people pay lip service to religion but don't <em>really</em> believe in it, and as such simply wouldn't have been fearful of any divine retribution?</p>
<p>I'm curious if the books say anything on these &quot;accomplices&quot;' perspectives.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","195052","<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> There were some absentees on the Frey side, guest right isn't held to as strongly as it once was and it <em>may</em> only apply to the host anyway. Even so a man of the host will most likely follow his host's orders as he doesn't really have any other choice.</p>
<p>In the <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/195031/58193"">answer by @Servitor</a> we see that a few of the Freys didn't attend The Red Wedding, most likely because they didn't want any part in it when we see the people's reactions to explaining their absence. Especially Ser Ryman's reaction both times i.e. stumbling over his words to Robb and sweating and being nervous when talking to Catelyn.</p>
<p>However, it is worth noting that guest right is held to less the further south you go and many people take it less seriously in modern times.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One notable custom that the Northmen hold dearer than any other is guest right, the tradition of hospitality by <strong>which a man may offer no harm to a guest beneath his roof, nor a guest to his host.</strong> The Andals held to something like it as well, but it looms less large in southron minds. In his text Justice and Injustice in the North: Judgments of Three Stark Lords, Maester Egbert notes that crimes in the North in which guest right was violated were rare but were invariably treated as harshly as the direst of treasons. Only kinslaying is deemed as sinful as the violations of these laws of hospitality.</p>
<p><sub><em>The World of Ice and Fire</em>, The North</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also when looking at those in the North where they do hold to it more closely even then there is mistrust to how much the hold to it and it is implied it is more of a tradition than an actual right nowadays.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Your father would have had my head off.&quot; The king [Mance Rayder] gave a shrug. &quot;<strong>Though once I had eaten at his board I was protected by guest right.</strong> The laws of hospitality are as old as the First Men, and sacred as a heart tree.&quot; He gestured at the board between them, the broken bread and chicken bones. &quot;Here you are the guest, and <strong>safe from harm at my hands</strong>... this night, at least. So tell me truly, Jon Snow. Are you a craven who turned your cloak from fear, or is there another reason that brings you to my tent?&quot;</p>
<p>Guest right or no, Jon Snow knew he walked on rotten ice here. One false step and he might plunge through, into water cold enough to stop his heart. Weigh every word before you speak it, he told himself. He took a long draught of mead to buy time for his answer. When he set the horn aside he said, &quot;Tell me why you turned your cloak, and I'll tell you why I turned mine.&quot;</p>
<p><sub><em>A Storm of Swords</em>, Jon I</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I do not know how you observe guest right on your mountain, ser. In the north we hold it sacred. Wun Wun is a guest here.&quot;</p>
<p><sub><em>A Dance with Dragons</em>, Jon IX</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking into the emphasised parts of the quotes above it also seems to imply that guest right is only from the host to the guests who have eaten. Everything refers to the host and the host's roof and &quot;safe from <em>my</em> hands&quot;.</p>
<p>However, it is worth noting that if guest right extends to everyone on the Lord's side it simply comes down to what the Lord says you do... he is your Lord after all. And if you don't go with it then what? You've disobeyed your Lord who is willing to break a sacred tradition by murdering a whole room full of nobles and their men, would you expect to live past that event?</p>
<hr />
<p>On a side note it is worth noting that what respect some people still held for guest right was almost completely gone in areas of the Riverlands following the events of The Red Wedding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hanged. The word sent a jolt of fear through her. She looked at the girl, Jeyne. She is too young to be so hard. &quot;Bread and salt,&quot; Brienne gasped. &quot;The inn... Septon Meribald fed the children... we broke bread with your sister...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Guest right don't mean so much as it used to,&quot; said the girl. &quot;Not since m'lady come back from the wedding. Some o' them swinging down by the river figured they was guests too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We figured different,&quot; said the Hound. &quot;They wanted beds. We gave 'em trees.&quot;</p>
<p><sub><em>A Feast for Crows</em>, Brienne VIII</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just to address Roose Bolton for a moment, he was more than just another Lord caught up in the fray of the event, he actually had a large part in organising it. The quote below alludes to this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Lord of White Harbor leaned forward. &quot;The Freys are no better. They speak of wargs and skinchangers and assert that it was Robb Stark who slew my Wendel. The arrogance of it! They do not expect the north to believe their lies, not truly, but they think we must pretend to believe or die. <strong>Roose Bolton lies about his part in the Red Wedding</strong>, and his bastard lies about the fall of Winterfell. And yet so long as they held Wylis I had no choice but to eat all this excrement and praise the taste.&quot;</p>

<p>Now the only explanation I have is that TV show is different from books, but this seems a major plot point that should somehow transfer to books as well.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","128589","<p>GRRM did say that it was a one time event however it does not seem to have held up. In the books as well, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daenerys_Targaryen"">Daenerys</a> has shown ability to be (almost) unscathed by fire more than once. First when she gave birth to her dragons as you mentioned. Second when she claimed Drogon at Draznak's pit as Ser Barristan recollects:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> <strong>Her hair was aflame.</strong> She had the whip in her hand and she was

<p>We know that part is true because Chapter sixty three of Dance with dragon says:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> She ran a hand across her stubbly scalp <strong>where her hair had burned</strong>
 <strong>away</strong>, and felt more ants on her head, and one crawling down the back
 of her neck. She knocked them off and crushed them under her bare
 feet. There were so many ...</p>

<p>And as we have Dany's own account as well:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> With a hiss, <strong>he spat black fire down at her</strong>. Dany darted
 underneath the flames, swinging the whip and shouting, “No, no, no.

<p>However, counter argument here would be that Daenerys tried to get away from that fire so she escaped with no more than her hair burned which is unlike the first event when she went into a pyre completely. But I suppose it is a weak argument because come on, it's dragon fire. Daenerys must have makings of a great athlete if she can be that quick. </p>

<p>This shows that Daenerys did continue to display her resilience against fire in future events of books as well. As you have noted as well, Show is heading into a completely different direction. How did Daenerys manage to appear unburnt out of the cottage? I fear the only speculation we can make is that Show runners are going to build on her supposed immunity to fire even further. </p>

<p>We can't have solid arguments in this regard because GRRM has never given us any details as to what exactly made Dany fireproof during birth of her dragons so we can't find similar patterns in future events she might show knack for being fireproof.</p>

"64147","Could Khal Drogo's Khalasar really have defeated the Iron Throne?","<p>I always found it surprising how scared everyone was about Daenerys' marriage to Khal Drogo and the possibility of the Dothraki horde crossing the Narrow Sea. In Season 1 Episode 5, Robert Baratheon specifically states that if they did cross the sea, they wouldn't be able to stop them. I don't understand this.</p>

<p>He would have all of Westeros behind him. The Knights of Westeros are extremely skilled, trained from an early age in swordsmanship. Their weapons are almost certainly of a higher quality, and they use tactics and strategy (I don't think it's ever stated what kind of battle formations the Dohtraki use). Furthermore, they wear armor, and it has been stated that the Dothrarki's Arakhs wouldn't be able to pierce Westerosi armor (although I don't know if they were talking about plate or mail).</p>

<p>Could the Seven Kingdoms really have lost against Khal Drogo's 40,000 men?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","64164","<p>I think there's two separate questions here: First, could Khal Drogo's khalasar have swept the Seven Kingdoms by themselves?</p>

<p>When Dany poses this very question to Ser Jorah, he seems convinced that they would win in open battle. (I'll be relying on the books for most of my analysis, but it should apply equally to the show).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>They are better riders than any knight, utterly fearless, and their bows outrange ours. In the Seven Kingdoms, most archers fight on foot, from behind a shieldwall or a barricade of sharpened stakes. The Dothraki fire from horseback, charging or retreating, it makes no matter, they are full as deadly... and there are so many of them, my lady. Your lord husband alone counts forty thousand mounted warriors in his khalasar... Your brother Rhaegar brought as many men to the Trident, but of that number, no more than a tenth were knights. The rest were archers, freeriders, and foot soldiers armed with spears and pikes. When Rhaegar fell, many threw down their weapons and fled the field. How long do you imagine such a rabble would stand against the charge of forty thousand screamers howling for blood? How well would boiled leather jerkins and mailed shirts protect them when the arrows fall like rain?” (GoT, Daenerys IV)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem is, as Ser Jorah notes, that the Dothraki have no experience or skill with siegecraft. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mind you, Princess, if the lords of the Seven Kingdoms have the wit the gods gave a goose, it will never come to that. The riders have no taste for siegecraft. I doubt they could take even the weakest castle in the Seven Kingdoms, but if Robert Baratheon were fool enough to give them battle...” (GoT, Daenerys IV)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And as for that question, he thinks its likely that while Robert was fool enough to meet them in open battle, his advisors were not.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He is a strong man, brave... and rash enough to meet a Dothraki horde in the open field. But the men around him, well, their pipers play a different tune. His brother Stannis, Lord Tywin Lannister, Eddard Stark... (GoT, Daenerys IV)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So as to whether or not the Dothraki could have taken the Seven Kingdoms <em>by themselves</em>, I think it's debatable, but I'm leaning towards no. So long as someone with any sense in them is behind the Iron Throne, it would be child's play to starve out 40,000 men with no knowledge of the surroundings and therefore limited foraging abilities. At the very least, the Dothraki would have been unable to create a naval blockade, meaning key locations like Dragonstone, Storm's End. and King's Landings would have been well-provisioned throughout the war.</p>

<p>But it's worth noting that in addition to the khalasar, Khal Drogo would likely have had significant allies that would have added to his chances of victory. (I leave the dragons out of this on the fair assumption that they would have never hatched without Drogo's death.)</p>

<p>Viserys seems convinced that some in the realm would rise for him, so much so that he didn't even think he needed the entire khalasar.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We won’t need his whole khalasar, “ Viserys said. His fingers toyed with the hilt of his borrowed blade, though Dany knew he had never used a sword in earnest. “Ten thousand, that would be enough, I could sweep the Seven Kingdoms with ten thousand Dothraki screamers. The realm will rise for its rightful king. Tyrell, Redwyne, Darry, Greyjoy, they have no more love for the Usurper than I do. The Dornishmen burn to avenge Elia and her children. And the smallfolk will be with us. They cry out for their king.” He looked at Illyrio anxiously. “They do, don’t they?” (GoT, Daenerys I)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now obviously, Viserys is pretty delusional about how anxious the realm is for his return. But Robert also tells Eddard that if Viserys returned, Targeryen loyalists would join him:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. Do you forget how many houses fought for Targaryen in the war? They bide their time for now, but give them half a chance, they will murder me in my bed, and my sons with me. If the beggar king crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the traitors will join him.” (GoT, Eddard II)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, this might just be King Robert being paranoid and his legendary hatred of the Targs. But we see some indications in later books that both men are right. To begin with, three of the houses that Viserys names rise against Robert's ""son"" Joffrey-- the Tyrells with Renly, the Darrys with Robb Stark, and the Greyjoys in their own rebellion-- and the fourth, the Redwynes, would have if the Lannisters weren't keeping their twin sons hostage.</p>

<p>I think Viserys was counting on Tyrell support because they were the last major house to turn against Aerys, but it's possible they would have joined out of pure ambition. The Tyrells are shown to basically switch sides to whoever looks like they have the greatest chance of victory, switching from Aerys to Robert to Renly to Joffrey. If the Tyrells ever decided that Drogo and the Targaryens had a better chance, they'd probably turn their cloaks and bring the most populous of the Seven Kingdoms with them.</p>

<p><em>A Feast of Crows</em> reveals that Viserys was right on the nose on two counts. First, Jaime reveals in a flashback that he and Tyrion found hidden dragon banners while staying at Castle Darry, indicating that they are still Targeryen loyalists. But more importantly, it's revealed that:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>Dorne has signed a secret pact to support Viserys and Daenerys when they invade Westeros, and Prince Doran has been plotting the overthrow of the Baratheons and Lannisters for over a decade.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And finally, it's worth noting a notable source of support that even Viserys didn't know he had: the Golden Company.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Which plan?” said Tristan Rivers. “The fat man’s plan? The one that changes every time the moon turns? First, Viserys Targaryen was to join us with fifty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back..."" (DwD, The Lost Lord)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For those who haven't read the books, the Golden Company is an elite mercenary group operating in Essos. It's primarily composed of exiled Westerosi, has 10,000 men in the company, many of them knights, and even have war elephants. They are very skilled at siegecraft, taking several castles with ease in the later chapters of <em>A Dance with Dragons</em>. One of the <em>Winds of Winter</em> sample chapters reveal:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> They have taken over the famously impregnable Storm's End.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I guess if your question is could Khal Drogo have taken the Iron Throne <em>at all</em>, rather than whether or not he could have done it alone, I think the answer is clearly yes. With the combination of his thousands of Dothraki screamers, the Golden Company, a few ragtag Targeryen loyalists, possibly the Tyrells...</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> ...and definitely the Dornish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like all what if? scenarios, nothing is 100% certain. Robb Stark and Renly Baratheron were both major players who were burned because of major unforeseen circumstances. In particular, Khal Drogo and Viserys are both wild cards. I can see either one of them acting in a way that would alienate their possible Westerosi allies. But I think they had a real shot at victory.</p>

"128713","Did Tywin Lannister suspect Arya of being connected with the assassin?","<p>In Game of Thrones Season 2 Episode 7, this exchange happens after Tywin finds his guardsman murdered with a dart poisoned with Wolfsbane:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tywin Lannister</strong>: I don't like mutton.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Arya Stark</strong>: ... I- I'll bring something else-</p>
  
  <p><strong>TL</strong>: Leave it. (walks over to the table) You hungry?</p>
  
  <p><strong>AS</strong>: (shakes her head quickly) No.</p>
  
  <p><strong>TL</strong>: Of course you are. (gestures to the dish of bread and
  mutton) Eat.</p>
  
  <p><strong>AS</strong>: I'll... eat in the kitchen, later.</p>
  
  <p><strong>TL</strong>: (impatiently) It's bad manners to refuse a Lord's
  offer. (walks around her, offers her a knife) Sit- eat. (Arya sits,
  takes the knife, and- after hesitating starts eating ravenously)
  You're small, for your age- I suppose you've been underfed your whole
  life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I could believe that he genuinely dislike mutton and likes Arya enough to have her eat before him (instead of bringing him more food), while he goes hungry. </p>

<p>However, isn't it very much possible that he suspected this highly educated girl of unknown noble parentage, dressed as a boy, to have something to do with the assassination? Only someone intelligent would have used a sophisticated poison, and the use of a dart could indicate that the assassin isn't a good fighter. He then insists that she eat before him to test her reaction should she have poisoned his food as well.</p>

<p>Is this covered in the books/elsewhere?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","128824","<p>It would probably depend on the specific point in the scene.
To draw a parallel, look at the poisoning attempt on Daenerys.</p>

<p>For Tywin:</p>

<ul>
<li>Initially - He's just had an attempt, he's hyper-aware, and the idea of ensuring that his food isn't poisoned is a good idea</li>
<li>Arya Hesitates - Now that would seem odd. Initially, he might have just been extra-cautious and Arya was just expendable, but now he definitely doesn't just want that food being taken away. <strong>At this point specifically, yeah, he almost definitely finds her behaviour odd and suspicious.</strong></li>
<li>Arya Eats - Why, what's to suspect now? She ate the food, it clearly wasn't poisonous, so why would she have anything to do with anything else?</li>
</ul>

<p>By contrast, when the poisoner is confronted by Jorah and is trying to be evasive - ""This is not meant for the likes of you"" (paraphrase), at that point Daenerys gets suspicious. He hesitates further by talking about letting it breathe, again further suspicious. And that suspicion is confirmed because he refuses to actually drink.</p>

<p>If Arya had flat out refused to eat the food or tried to run away, that would be a different story. It would have clearly connected her with an assassination attempt on him, and therefore the other assassination attempt. The idea of two random, unconnected assassination attempts within the same day-ish would have been ludicrous. Since <strong>that</strong> didn't happen, ultimately no. But for that brief moment between her hesitation and eating it, yes.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> How Hodor came to only say ""Hodor""... he was <em>holding the door</em> while Bran was escaping and warged. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does this mean </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Hodor saw his own death, and then knew for the rest of his life?</p>
</blockquote>
","<game-of-thrones>","128875","<h1>Probably not.</h1>

<p>This is obviously based on a personal deduction (this question is fairly opinion-based), but in my opinion it is pretty close to what happened. </p>

<p>So, we have Bran warging into present Hodor <strong>while he is still in the past</strong>. This is pretty much fact: we see Hodor's eyes go white for an instant (as they did the first time Bran warged into him) , and then he acts in a resolved way he only showed when possessed by Bran. Moreover, he does not say ""Hodor"" once (which suggests again he is not himself at that moment).</p>

<p>From how the scene is assembled, we can assume that, in order to be able to warging into present Hodor, Bran uses the past one as some sort of bridge. This is backed up by three facts:<br>
a) Past Hodor looks directly at Bran<br>
b) Past Hodor does not fall unconscious or lose will during the whole scene, he just seems lightheaded and confused<br>
c) Well, the whole outcome.<br></p>

<p>So the past Hodor is probably not really seeing what's happening in the future. He is just getting vague feelings of what is going on at both sides, including the feelings he gets from present Hodor's death and Meera's voice. </p>

<p>To sum it up, past Hodor saw Bran and he experienced vague feelings of what was going on in the future, including a death experience that leaves him permanently scarred. The common objection to this ""why wasn't he scared by Bran then"" can be explained by the fact that he saw him grow up.</p>

<p>Ps: I agree that the initial Hodor panic may be related to him getting strange deja-vu from the whole setting, but not to him consciously remembering everything that happened.</p>

</blockquote>
","<game-of-thrones>","128921","<p>I dont think there is a definitive cannonical answer yet. As far as I know, Bran had never warged into two things at the same time prior to this incident.</p>

<p>Hodor was a totally normal kid that was screwed over by Bran.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/game-thrones-hodor-twist-impact-896603?utm_source=twitter"" rel=""noreferrer"">Hollywood Reporter</a> also posted an article that extrapolated a bit. Obviously this isn't canon, but I post it since it contains some perspectives that hadn't originally occurred to me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the final moments of &quot;The Door,&quot; Bran's green-seeing and warging abilities crossed the streams in such a way that he wargs into Hodor and orders him to &quot;hold the door&quot; from an army of the dead. It gives the present Hodor his final directive, and the past Hodor the new name and limited vocabulary that would haunt him for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>In Game of Thrones, Bran hopping into the past and ordering Wylis to &quot;hold the door&quot; always happened, resulting in the name and word &quot;Hodor.&quot; While it's a harrowing end for such a beloved character, the implications are even more unsettling, as it confirms suspicions that Bran can indeed interact with the past, with horrific results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Take together, the implication is that Bran was indeed warging present Hodor and past Wyllis/Hodor at the same time. Furthermore, the Bran's interference in the past is what caused Wyllis to become Hodor. Bran doesn't just view the past, his actions there can have real consequences.</p>

","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","64357","<p>The Stranger is indeed the death god of the Faith of the Seven as well as the god of the unknown. I imagine the main reason very few people pray to him is the taboo surrounding death that exists in most human cultures. Most people just don't like thinking about death, let alone praying to its personification. For similar reasons, the Stranger is the only god without hymns.</p>

<p>In addition to his unpleasant domain, the Stranger, in his name and his popular depictions, is seen as inhuman, distant, and unknowable. The statue of the Stranger that Stannis burns was ""carved to look more animal than human"" (CoK, Davos I). The Stranger's likeness in the Red Keep also has a ""halfhuman face"" (CoK, Sansa IV) Catelyn Stark's description of a sept's statue of the Stranger is particularly unappealing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...the Stranger was neither male nor female, yet both, ever the outcast, the wanderer from far places, less and more than human, unknown and unknowable. Here the face was a black oval, a shadow with stars for eyes. It made Catelyn uneasy. She would get scant comfort there. (CoK, Catelyn III)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, the Stranger is creepy. But there are actually a few instances of people praying to the Stranger in the books, for a series of reasons:</p>

<p><b>KINSHIP</b></p>

<p>Tyrion lights a candle to the Stranger in a sept:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tyrion lingered after his cousin had slipped away. At the Warrior’s altar, he used one candle to light another. Watch over my brother, you bloody bastard, he’s one of yours. He lit a second candle to the Stranger, for himself. (CoK, Tyrion III)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tyrion's prayer ""for himself"" is a bit ambiguous. If he was lighting a candle to prevent his death, it seems odd that he wouldn't light one for Jaime at that altar as well. My guess is that because the Stranger is the ""outcast"" according to Catelyn, Tyrion thinks he is also ""one of"" the Stranger's the way Jaime is ""one of"" the Warrior's.</p>

<p>Likewise, the Silent Sisters who prepare bodies for burial are considered servants of the Stranger, and presumably pray to him fairly often.</p>

<p><strong>IN THANKS</strong></p>

<p>Cersei gives another example of why someone might light a candle to the Stranger: to thank him for someone else's death.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One day she must light a candle to the Stranger for carrying Renly off and leaving Stannis. If it had been the other way around, her life would have been harder. (FfC, Cersei II)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>FOR DEATH</strong></p>

<p>Cersei implies in the same chapter that those who want death also pray to the Stranger.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""...When we find the Imp, we will find the Lady Sansa too. She is not dead... but before I am done with her, I promise you, she will be singing to the Stranger, begging for his kiss.” (FfC, Cersei II)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is also the purpose of the statue of the Stranger in the House of the Many-Faced God, a place in Braavos fore those seeking death.</p>

<p><strong>SHEER DESPERATION</strong></p>

<p>Cersei prays to the Stranger when she is in great peril.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All the prayers they had taught her as a girl came back to Cersei... and she made up new ones as needed, calling on the Mother and the Maiden, on the Father and the Warrior, on the Crone and the Smith. She had even prayed to the Stranger. <em>Any god in a storm.</em> (DwD, Cersei I)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that Cersei's prayer to the Stranger is remarked upon as unusual <em>even though her life is at stake</em>, indicates that people probably don't pray to the Stranger to prevent death. Indeed, when Stannis attacks King's Landing, Sansa notes that the brightest altars are the Warrior (god of warriors and combat) and the Mother (goddess of mercy).</p>

<p>EDIT: The wiki points out an interesting depiction of the Stranger in the newest Winds of Winter sample chapter I thought I'd add. Minor spoilers:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> A Braavosi play called Bloody Hand depicts a fictionalized account of Tyrion Lannister. In the play, a psuedo-Tyrion meets with the Stranger and is implied to strike a sort of Faustian bargain. Mind you, the Braavosi are not the best source for Westerosi religious beliefs. But that seems to confirm that the Stranger is seen as the patron god for the outcasts of Westeros.</p>

<p>As we learn in ADwD,</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Varys supports both the return of Daenerys and that of Aegon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, Barristan's dismissal supports both of these causes</p>

</blockquote>

<p>but</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>Barristan ending up next to Daenerys was quite favorable to her (with respect to Aegon).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there any indication that tells us that Varys approached Ser Barristan (directly or indirectly) about where he should go to?
Or was removing Ser Barristan from the Lannister side enough of a goal for him and was his appearance next to Daenerys not his doing?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","64439","<p>I think Varys makes it perfectly clear that the claimant to the Iron Throne he supports is Aegon. So right off the bat, I have trouble seeing why Varys would have wanted Ser Barristan to go to Dany instead of him. Ilyrio and Varys only support Dany to the extent that she can aid Aegon's claim.</p>

<p>Ser Barristan himself gives Daenerys an account of what happened after he left Joffrey's service. He stayed in King's Landing for a month disguised as a peasant, until he witnessed the execution of Eddard Stark. At that moment, he began questioning his years of service to the Usurper, and realizes the only way to make penitence is to find Aerys' daughter and pledge his service. He never says how he ended up with Ilyrio, but he would have known from the Small Council meetings that Ilyrio and the Targeryen siblings were close.</p>

<p>All indications from Ser Barristan are that he genuinely had a desire to seek Dany out and protect her. He could be lying I suppose, but we get no sense of that from his POV chapters and it'd run contrary to his character. So if Varys DID intend for Ser Barristan to go to her, it was a pretty lucky guess on his part.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I can see many reasons why Varys wouldn't want Barristan with Dany. Ser Barristan has a very negative view of Varys, and outs Ser Jorah as one of the Spider's spies. He can also confirm that Varys was the one who sent Robert's order to have her killed, and even voted for her death.</p>

<p>I think it's much more likely that Varys just wanted to weaken Joffrey by sending away a major asset. The fact that Ser. Barristan ended up with Daenerys instead of Renly or Stannis was likely just a happy coincidence.</p>

<p>In the scene the wall looked rather high and even though the ground was covered by snow, I just can not believe they would have survived that jump. Even if  survival is possible, they should have had a couple broken bones, especially their legs.</p>

","<game-of-thrones>","131047","<p>If you hit something that can give way slowly, the time of which you decelerate can lengthen considerably, such that the G force of impact is very minor.</p>

<p>During WW2 in particular, when a lot of people were jumping out of planes, many people were documented to have survived falling from extreme heights. Usually they landed into piles of snow or soft muddy river banks.</p>

<p>A jump from the ramparts would have been at even less speed and impact than that. So basically, no magic physics is required, its certainly believable to survive without major injury.</p>

<p>To my mind, the biggest question is, what they did after they jumped. I would have thought they would have to bury themselves until night fall, as even the most basic of guardsmen would see two people running across a white snow plain.</p>

"129202","Why do the Wights change their behavior so much over time in Game of Thrones?","<p>In the ASOIAF books there haven't been many battles from the point of view of someone who has fought an army of wights, so it's unclear how they supposed to act or if there has been any evolution of their behavior within the scope of the story.</p>

<p>However we do see plenty of them in Game of Thrones, and in the first few seasons we see the wights act more like actual humans. They walk upright (when they have legs) and when they attack they tend to use their weapons.</p>

<p>One clear occurrence in which we see this is in S04E10 <strong>The Children</strong> when Bran, Hodor and the Reeds are attacked by undead before they enter the cave. The skeletons fight with weapons, and stand and duel like actual soldiers would.</p>

<p>In S05E08 <strong>Hardhome</strong>, the Wights act slightly more savagely, attacking with claws and teeth like classic zombies, and occasionally barrelling into people and tackling them with their bodies with little regard for their well-being. They still run around upright and do mostly use weapons to fight, but they already have diverged from being human-like. </p>

<p>Season 6 spoilers:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>Then in the episode S06E05 <strong>The Door</strong>, the wights tend to run around on all fours, climbing on ceilings, and overall being more savage, feral and even less human-like than before. They do still have weapons and are seen in formation when in the presence of the White Walkers, but as soon as they attempt to enter the cave they are seen acting entirely inhumanly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suppose the greatest divergence that can be seen is in the way that they execute these two different victims:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>In <strong>The Children</strong>, the skeletons stab Jojen whilst he is lay on the floor defenseless, yet in <strong>The Door</strong> they not only stab but also maul Leaf (the Forest Child) with claws and teeth when she is in almost the same situation, and they do the same with Hodor (though they don't really have the opportunity to stab him).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Comparing the earlier battle scenes with the most recent ones, they barely seem like the same creatures. Is there a reason, in or out-of universe why they have changed so much?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","132835","<p>This is mostly speculative, but earlier in the series, the pool of dead bodies is largely rangers and wildling fighters and hunters who range out to the edges of the wilderness and die, whether it be at the hands of Walkers, Wights or otherwise.

<p>In the later episodes, that undead army is now coming down from the fringes and is looking to invade the world of men.  At Hardhome there is a massive slaughter of fighters, but also ""civilian"" wildlings - children, farmers, elderly etc, as well as those trying to fight.  And then they get raised up, en masse, on the spot.  A huge number of those did not go down with weapons, so they would be unarmed.  I don't think the wights especially care, if they have weapons they use them, if they don't, they don't.  It may be that you just have more who come to them unarmed, based on who they were and the circumstances at death. Hardhome was probably not the first killing of non-combatant wildlings on their way to that location.</p>

"129268","Why were Stormcrows renamed to Second Sons in Game of Thrones tv show?","<p>In books there are several sellswords companies, among them two fighting for Daenerys: Second Sons and Stormcrows. Daario Naharis is one of three co-captains of Stormcrows, Second Sons are under command of Mero. In the TV show however, there is one company, Second Sons, under Daario Naharis command. Why was this change made? If the main goal was to simplify things a bit, why didn't scenario writers just remove Second Sons from the show? Why merge them, by keeping Stormcrows plotline (Daario Naharis killing the other two co-captains etc.) and Second Sons name?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","129283","<p>The name change may be due to the similarity with the <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Stone_Crows"">Stone Crows</a>, a hill tribe that Tyrion encounters in Season One. </p>

<p>This would be consistent with other name changes by the show, such as <a href=""http://winteriscoming.net/2011/07/27/producers-confirm-asha-name-change/"">changing Asha Greyjoy to Yara Greyjoy</a> to make the name less similar to Osha the Wildling:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>David also confirmed reports that producers are working on changing the name of Theon Greyjoy’s sister, who in the books is called Asha. “We’re a little bit worried about the Osha/Asha sounding too close together,” David said, making a reference to the Season 1 wildling character. “So it might be a slightly different name.""</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> We know (or strongly suspect) that Bran Stark caused Wyllis/Hodor to
 become mentally ill by warging into him back in time.
 Could the Three-Eyed-Raven have warged into (or spoken into the mind
 of) the Mad King Aerys? He could have tried to warn Aerys about the
 white walkers and encouraged him to burn the white walkers. This led
 to Aerys going insane and saying ""burn them all"".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there anything from the books which help answer that question?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","129323","<p><strong>No there is no such evidence in the books or any mention of it.</strong> </p>

<p>Why, you ask? Because:</p>

<h2>Fire's ineffectiveness against Others</h2>

<p>Melisandre said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Necromancy animates these wights, yet they are still only dead flesh.
  Steel and fire will serve for them. The ones you call the Others are
  something more.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This implies that Others can't be killed by normal fire and steel. </p>

<p>Also in <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Fight_at_the_Fist"" rel=""noreferrer"">Battle of the Fist of First Men</a>, we saw that fire arrows did not stop the onslaught of the others and their thralls.</p>

<p>This proves that others are immune to ordinary fire and thus it makes no sense for Three Eyed Raven to try and warn the mad king to the danger and to use ordinary fire against them. Granted, Wildfire burns hotter than ordinary fire but it is no magical fire. </p>

<p>Some might point out that Pyromancers do mention that appearance of dragons could result in increased production of Wildfire in prelude to battle of Blackwater bay but that does not prove Wildfire is magical. If it were magical, art of producing wildfire should have died when last dragon died in reign of Aegon III. Dragons might act as catalyst to production of Wildfire but the product remains chemical in nature, not magical. </p>

<h2>Three Eyed Raven's preferred means of Communication</h2>

<p>When Three eyed Raven wanted to communicate something, he uses dreams and even messengers as we saw in case of Bran when he used to appear in his dreams and even sent the Reed Siblings to get him to North. He did not ""warg"" into Bran and make him come beyond the wall. </p>

<h2>Skin Changers code of Ethics beyond the wall</h2>

<p>From what we know from Wildlings, Skinchangers have a code of honor according to <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Haggon"" rel=""noreferrer"">which warging into another human is considered horrible and abomination</a> if used to manipulate the other person.  </p>

<h2>Targaryen Inbreeding and madness</h2>

<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Targaryen_madness"" rel=""noreferrer"">Targaryen madness</a> is something which can be attributed to centuries of incest and inbreeding. Aerys's grandfather, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon_V_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Aegon V</a> detested incest and tried to marry his children to other houses. Two of them, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jaehaerys_II_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Jaehaerys</a> and <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Shaera_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Shaera</a> however secretly married each other and Aegon was forced to accept that. Jaehaerys and Shaera later had Aerys (insane) and Rhaella (sane), who were married to each other. Results were Rhaegar (sane), Viserys (Insane), Daenerys (Sane). Aegon V himself had a mad brother, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aerion_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Aerion the Monstrous</a>, who thought drinking wildfire would make him a dragon. </p>

<p>Historical mad Targaryens include:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Maegor_I_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">King Maegor the Cruel</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Baelor_I_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">King Baelor the Blessed</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rhaegel_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Prince Rhaegel</a></li>

<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Viserys_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Prince Viserys</a></li>
</ol>

<p>No one warged into five of the six even if we assume Aerys went mad because of that, they still were insane.</p>

<h2>Who is Three eyed raven?</h2>

<p>In Books, it is a <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/2hcg3q/spoilers_adwd_who_is_bloodraven/"" rel=""noreferrer"">very popular theory</a> that three eyed raven is a Targaryen himself, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Brynden_Rivers"" rel=""noreferrer"">Brynden Bloodraven</a>, son of King Aegon IV and uncle to Maester Aemon. He killed his <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daemon_I_Blackfyre"" rel=""noreferrer"">half-brother</a> and <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Blackfyre_Rebellion"" rel=""noreferrer"">nephews</a> to protect Targaryen dynasty in Blackfyre rebellions. He was later sent to the wall for another such act done to protect the Targaryen dynasty from Blackfyres. Why would he sow seeds to destroy it by taking the risk of making Aerys mad even if we discard the evidence that Aerys was inbred enough to go mad anyways?</p>

<p>Three eyed raven said about changing course of events:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I have my own ghosts, Bran. A brother that I loved (<a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daemon_I_Blackfyre"" rel=""noreferrer"">Daemon</a> or <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daeron_II_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Daeron</a>), a
  brother that I hated (<a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegor_Rivers"" rel=""noreferrer"">Aegor</a>), a woman that I desired (<a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Shiera_Seastar"" rel=""noreferrer"">Shiera</a>). Through
  the trees, I see them still, but no word of mine has ever reached
  them. The past remains the past. We can learn from it, but we cannot
  change it.""</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Aerys's Obsession with fire and dragons</h2>

<p>Aerys was obsessed with fire <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aerys_II_Targaryen#Year_of_the_False_Spring"" rel=""noreferrer"">long before</a> Others ever reappeared after the long night. According to Jaime, Aerys hoped to rise again as a dragon from ashes, another one of Targaryen madnesses. Aerion too thought that drinking wildfire would make him rise as a dragon. His order to burn the city was simply given to take final revenge from Robert as a Dragon. Jaime made sure that did not happen by cutting his throat.</p>

<p>From ASOS Jaime V, Jaime recalling Aerys's order to burn the city:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Aerys meant to have the greatest funeral pyre of them all. Though if
  truth be told, I do not believe he truly expected to die. Like Aerion
  Brightfire before him, Aerys thought the fire would transform him...
  that he would rise again, reborn as a dragon, and turn all his enemies
  to ash.</p>

"64565","Why was Shae in the Tower of the Hand?","<p>I haven't read the books yet, but I have been watching and re-watching and re-watching again, the show. And nowhere since he first appeared on the screen Tywin Lannister seemed like the kind of person who will use the service of a whore. Let alone share one with his son.</p>

<p>But sure enough, from reading about the fourth season finale a little bit, it seems that this part was more or less true to the books. So Shae was with Tywin the night Tyrion was sprung out, and it seems to hint that Shae and Tywin ""did the deed"".</p>

<p>So I wonder if the books reveal a different Tywin than Charles Dance's excellent acting?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","64576","<p>If one pays close attention to what <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tywin_Lannister"">Tywin</a> says to <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tyrion"">Tyrion</a>, one can notice, as Theik says in his answer, that he is not opposed to visiting whores, only in doing so publicly. For example, he says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You will <em>not</em> bring the whore to court.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(I.e. ""keep her out of sight"".) And</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You're done with whores. The next one I find in your bed, I'll hang.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(I.e. ""make sure I don't find her"".) And of course, we are familiar with the story of Tysha, the common girl that Tywin ""made"" into a whore by allowing his soldiers to rape her. </p>

<p>The foreshadowing of Tywin's derogatory view of prostitutes is <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tytos_Lannister"">his father's</a> relationship with a woman who was <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Tytos_Lannister%27s_mistress"">""a common born woman, daughter of a candlemaker""</a>. Lord Tytos was not a strong lord, and this woman took liberties that according to Tywin shamed house Lannister. He therefore upon his father's death punished her by stripping her naked and running her out of town. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I was made to suffer my father's follies. I will not suffer yours."" <br>
  -- Tywin to Tyrion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If one pays close attention to an earlier Tyrion chapter, where Tyrion and <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Varys"">Varys</a> discuss a hidden entrance to the brothel that Tyrion uses as cover:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Tyrion:] ""How is it a brothel happens to have a secret entrance?""<br></p>
  
  <p>[Varys:] ""The tunnel was dug for another King's Hand, whose honor would not allow him to enter such a house openly. Chataya has closely guarded the knowledge of its existence."" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We do not know for sure, of course, but Tywin was Hand of the King for a good long time, during Aerys' reign.</p>

<p>With all this in mind, it does look as though Tywin has a rather warped relationship to prostitutes. He takes every chance to humiliate and punish them in public -- like he whipped <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Alayaya"">Alayaya</a> because he thought Tyrion had slept with her -- while in private, they are his guilty pleasure. </p>

<p>But of course, the only real evidence is that we know he slept with Shae.</p>

"64585","Why did Petyr Baelish want Ned to send Loras instead of Lord Beric?","<p>In <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Game_of_Thrones-Chapter_43"" rel=""noreferrer"">Chapter 43 of AGOT</a>, Ned Stark sends Lord Beric Dondarrion to bring Ser Gregor Clegane to justice in the name of the King. In the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Game_of_Thrones-Chapter_44"" rel=""noreferrer"">next chapter</a>, Petyr Baelish overhears Sansa say that Ned should have sent Ser Loras instead. This catches his attention:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The young lady is as wise as she is lovely</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then he asks her why, and Sansa reluctantly explains her ""heroes and monsters"" reasoning. Petyr responds:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, those are not the reasons I'd have given, but...</p>

<p>Why would Petyr have charged Ser Loras with this task?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","64614","<p>At that point of time Petyr was still banking on Ned coming out triumphant with him riding on his coat tails. The Lannisters were a major House, and had immense amounts of power not only financially, but militarily and politically as well. </p>

<p>If Ned had sent Loras Tyrell instead of Beric Dondarrion, that would've meant that the Tyrells were (at least nominally) on the Stark side. The Mountain attacking a force lead by a beloved Tyrell son, would've been a grave insult to another major House that rivals the Lannisters in power. If something would've happened to Loras (as it did to Beric) the Tyrells would've become completely antagonistic to the Lannisters with very little chance of peace between them, let alone alliance.</p>

<p>Instead, Ned (who is incredibly naive when it comes to politics) sends a minor lord of small House, a smattering of knights of little influence, and most of the Stark household guards. Petyr knew this was a huge mistake, and tells Sansa as much.</p>

"129414","What are the advantages that come with knighthood in Westeros?","<p>Often in the story we see characters be promised knighthood. This usually seems to be a big deal to those that receive it. For example after the battle of the Blackwater, Bronn clearly reminds people of his new status. Surely there must be more to knighthood than simple social status or else people wouldn't make such a big deal of knighthood.</p>

<p>What are the advantages a man gains when knighted? Does he gain lands? Or simply prestige?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><laws>","129570","<p>Being a Knight puts you above the smallfolk and opens up prospects but you are still beneath the landed nobility. You can say they are sort of a Quasi-Nobility (If they are not descended from nobility itself). Following are some benefits a Knight enjoys:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Knights can <strong>marry younger daughters of landed houses</strong> and thus climb up a step on social ladder like <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bronn"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ser Bronn of Blackwater</a> did by marrying <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lollys_Stokeworth"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lolys Stokeworth</a>. A commoner can never hope to marry an aristocrat girl but Knights are considered a valid match for at least younger daughters of impoverished or minor houses. <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Duncan_the_Tall"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ser Eustace Osgrey</a>, head of a minor and diminished house from the Reach said he would have married his daughter Alysanne to Ser Duncan the tall if she were alive. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, Commonborn Knights are no fit consort for Ladies of major houses   as <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rohanne_Webber"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lady Rohanne Webber</a> decided not to marry Duncan despite having feelings for him. She later went on to be grandmother of Lord Tywin Lannister. Quoting Rohanne Webber from <em>The Sworn Sword</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You are quite mad,"" The smoke had filled her eyes with tears. ""If you
  were better born, I would have married you""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later she said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I had to marry you know... my father's will. Oh don't be such a fool.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bonifer_Hasty"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ser Bonifer Hasty</a> and Princess (Later Queen) <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rhaella_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Rhaella Targaryen</a> loved each other but Bonifer could never hope to marry the princess because  of his low birth. According to Barristan Selmy:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Their love was ultimately a brief thing and could never have been
  otherwise, as Bonifer was of far too low birth to be considered as a
  suitor for a princess of the royal line</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In more recent events, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Amerei_Frey"" rel=""noreferrer"">Amerei ""Gatehouse"" Frey</a> married a hedge knight named <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Pate_of_the_Blue_Fork"" rel=""noreferrer"">Pate of the Blue Fork</a>. The unseemly match was made because Amerei was daughter of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Merrett_Frey"" rel=""noreferrer"">9th son</a> of Lord Walder Frey and was notorious for her promiscuity. </p></li>
<li><p>Knights can escape judgement of a lord for any crime by demanding <strong>a trial by combat</strong>. It might not save you but at least you don't get to be sentenced by some posh aristocrat. <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Duncan_the_Tall"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ser Duncan the Tall</a> used this right to escape judgment of lordlings for hitting Prince Aerion Targaryen. As <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Baelor_Targaryen_(son_of_Daeron_II)"" rel=""noreferrer"">Prince Baelor Breakspear</a> told Ser Duncan in <em>The Hedge Knight</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""You have another choice though"", Prince Baelor said quietly. ""Whether it
  is a better choice or worse, I can not say, But I remind you that any
  Knight accused of a crime has a right to demand trial by combat.""</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Knights can <strong>win renown and money by jousting</strong> (And winning) against rich nobles. Non-Knights can some times be allowed to joust as well like in Tourney of KL but there are events in which it is only reserved for Knights such as Tourney at Ashford. Quoting Plummer the Steward from <em>The Hedge Knight</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Plummer pursed his lips. ""My Lord's tourney is a contest for Knights.
  Are you a Knight?""</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Knights can officially and legally <strong>lay foundation of a new house</strong> by taking a name and forming their coat of Arms. For example, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Artys_I_Arryn"" rel=""noreferrer"">Artys Arryn</a> who founded House Arryn was originally a knight. Their coat of Arms can only be inherited by their true-born sons. Bastards can not inherit or display the arms. A true-born daughter or son can display the arms but he can not call himself a Knight unless he is anointed and Knighted by some Knight. Quoting Prince Baelor from <em>The Hedge Knight</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""By law, only a true born son is entitled to inherit a Knight's arms.
  You must needs find a new device Ser, A sigil of your own.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also Jon said in <em>AGOT</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Girls get the arms but not the swords. Bastards get the swords but
  not the   arms. I did not make the rules, little sister.""</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Knights can legally <strong>create new Knights &amp; take squires</strong>. e.g. Ser Lyonel Baratheon knighted squire Raymun Fossoway. Ser Arthur Dayne knighted the squire Jaime Lannister. Ser Arlan of Pennytree apparently knighted his squire Duncan the Tall. Quoting Ser <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lyonel_Baratheon"" rel=""noreferrer"">Lyonel Baratheon</a> from <em>The Hedge Knight</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The lad has the truth of it,"" said Ser Lyonel Baratheon. ""Do it, Ser
  Duncan. Any knight can make a knight"".</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Knights are usually <strong>held in high esteem by common people and orders</strong> such as the Nights Watch. Knights are usually preferred to command at Night's Watch for different tasks for example <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Wynton_Stout"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ser Wynton Stout</a> was chosen as Castellan of Castle Black when Bowen Marsh went West to fight at bridge of Skulls. Sole reason for this appointment was that Stout was a knight. From <em>ASOS, Jon's POV</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If Marsh is gone, who did he name as castellan?”</p>
  
  <p>The armorer laughed. “Ser Wynton, gods preserve him. Last knight in
  the castle and all. The thing is, Stout seems to have forgotten and no
  one’s been rushing to remind him. I suppose I’m as much a commander as
  we have now. The meanest of the cripples.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly Jaime recalls that on his return from Harrenhal after being   officiated as a Knight of Kingsguard, the bar keep refused to take money from him and said that this was a story to tell his grandchildren. <em>From ASOS, Jaime's POV</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The innkeep had refused his coin. ""It's an honor to have a knight of
  the Kingsguard under my roof, ser,"" the man had said. ""It's a tale
  I'll tell my grandchildren.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it can be said that this sort of special treatment comes with being a Knight of the Kingsguard or a Knight of massive fame. </p></li>
<li><p>Knights can hope to <strong>ransom themselves if they are bested</strong> in battle. Common soldiers are not taken captives and are usually slaughtered. Knights however can yield to their enemies in hopes to be ransomed later. From <em>Tyrion's POV in ACOK</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I yield, ser,” a different knight called out, farther down the river.
  “Yield. Ser knight, I yield to you. My pledge, here, here.” The man
  lay in a puddle of black water, offering up a lobstered gauntlet in
  token of submission.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also from <em>Arya's POV in ACOK</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gendry frowned. “Knights and lordlings, they take each other captive
  and pay ransoms, but they don’t care if the likes of you yield or
  not.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Knights have <strong>better prospects at finding service</strong> than a common man at arms because Knights are thought to be valuable fighters due to their rigorous training which usually starts at childhood. Service with landed nobles can give them a chance to perform tasks which can in turn reward them with landed titles of their own from their liege. They can even rise to companionship of Kings as Knights of Kingsguard.</p></li>
<li><p>Knights are usually <strong>held in high esteem by the faith of seven</strong> because of their vows to defend the faith and because of knighthood being rooted in Andal religion. With reformation of faith militant, Knights can seek service there as well. Quoting <em>from a Feast For Crows, Brienne's POV</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When they saw the hedge knights, the begging brothers halted, and the
  chanting died away. “Good knights,” one said, “the Mother loves you.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Being a Knight has an <strong>impact on your love life</strong> as well. Westerosi Ladies seem to love the valiant Knights. Example would be the innkeep's daughter whose mother (The innkeep) complained about that to Ser Duncan the Tall:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The girl turn to sighs and giggles everytime a knight rides by. I
  swear I could not tell you why. Knights are built the same as other
  men.""</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Your <strong>word carries more weight</strong> if you swear it by ""your honor as a knight"". Same goes for your testimonies. Ferrymen on trident took Sandor Clegane on board when he swore a false oath on his honor as a knight to pay them when they were across. <em>From ASOS, Arya's POV</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“How do I know you’re good for it?” the bent-backed man asked, after a
  moment. He’s not, she wanted to shout. instead she bit her lip.</p>
  
  <p>“Knight’s honor,” the Hound said, unsmiling. He’s not even a knight.
  She did not say that either.</p>
  
  <p>“That will do.” The ferryman spat.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Knights are thought to be a <strong>boost to prestige of a diplomatic mission</strong> especially if they are descended from some noble house. We saw this when Petyr Baelish demanded Knights should accompany him at his meeting with Tyrells. <em>From AFFC, Tyrion POV</em>, Baelish said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“And forty more-twenty knights with as many squires. If I arrive
  without a knightly tail, the Tyrells will think me of small account.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Knights can <strong>support other Knights in</strong> <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Trial_of_seven"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>trials of seven</strong></a>. e.g. Ser Lyonel Baratheon joined Ser Duncan the Tall in his trial against Prince Aerion. Quoting <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Maekar_I_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Prince Maekar</a> from <em>A Hedge Knight</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Don’t play the fool, it will not serve. It must be seven against
  seven. You must needs find six other knights to fight beside you.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also Quoting Ser Steffon Fossoway from <em>A Hedge Knight</em>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Raymun the Reluctant,” mocked his cousin Ser Steffon. An apple made
  of gold and garnets fastened his cloak of yellow wool. “You need not
  fear, cousin, this is a knightly combat. As you are no knight, your
  skin is not at risk. Ser Duncan, you have one Fossoway at least. The
  ripe one. I saw what Aerion did to those puppeteers. I am for you.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Knights can be offered <strong>a chance to join Night's Watch</strong> as Tywin Lannister offered Ser Alliser Thorne &amp; Ser Jaremy Rykker a chance to Join NW or be beheaded. But this is not exclusive to Knights, commonfolk can also be offered that chance. <em>From AGOT, Tyrion's POV</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ser Jaremy Rykker commented dryly. “I ought to know, I was there on
  the battlements beside him (Thorne). Tywin Lannister gave us a
  splendid choice. Take the black, or see our heads on spikes before
  evenfall. No offense intended, Tyrion.”</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Knights <strong>can sit in viewing gallery</strong> with nobles in a tourney. Quoting Ser Raymun Fossoway from <em>The Hedge Knight</em>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Well met lad,"" Ser Raymun said easily. ""Ser Duncan, why not watch

<li><p><strong>FREE FOOD AT WEDDINGS!!!!</strong> It is considered bad luck to refuse to host a knight on one's wedding among the nobles. So Knights are always welcome at noble weddings. Ser Duncan the Tall enjoyed this benefit at wedding of Lord Butterwell with daughter of Lord Frey. Quoting from <em>The Mystery Knight</em>, Ser Duncan notices:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Though uninvited, the three of them had been welcomed to the feast
  quick enough; It was ill luck to refuse a knight hospitality on your

<p>However Knighthood does not guarantee lands. A knight may or may not be landed. </p>

<p>If a Knight is sworn to some landed noble, he is a house-hold knight aka <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Knight#Types_of_knights"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>Sworn sword</strong></a>. If a Knight holds some lands from his liege lord, he becomes a <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Landed_knight"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>Landed knight</strong></a>. If he holds neither land nor permanent service with some lord, he is a <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Hedge_knight"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>Hedge knight</strong></a>. </p>

<p>A Song of Ice and Fire mostly lead us through life of nobility. If you want a closer view of life of a Knight, specially a Knight with no noble lineage, I would highly recommend reading the Dunk &amp; Egg series which has been recently compiled into a single volume called ""<a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0345533488"" rel=""noreferrer"">A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms</a>"".</p>

"129436","Who governs the Night's Watch now?","<p>Once it was an honour to serve under the Night's Watch, but in more recent times it has become less of a role that people want and more of a role for people who commit crimes or are ""bastards"".</p>

<p>In the first series, we discover that Ned Stark is seen to be somewhat governing the Night's Watch (he is seen beheading someone of the Night's Watch for abandoning their post). It is also noted that the North sees the Night's Watch as an important factor, whereas the south, although they recognize it they do not show much regard. Ned Stark is no longer with us, and abandoning their post is no longer happening so this question is probably based on opinions. </p>

<p>Let's skip to the most recent series, we find that:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> The north is no longer peaceful and is in utter turmoil, with Ramsey declaring himself the Warden of the North whose only intent on building an army to destroy everyone around him. No other houses are seen to be making a note.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the latest episode (S6E5) we see that:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Jon Snow has left the the Night's Watch going to fight Ramsey </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the question is:</p>

<p>With what has been going on, what makes the people of the Night's Watch stay? The way that I see things, they could just leave and not face any punishment, at least not for a while anyway. Is the Night's Watch really turning back into a honourable place where everyone <strong>wants</strong> to stay there? They see it as their right and their duty now, they have seen what has been going on. </p>

<p>You could argue that:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Jon Snow</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Would therefore give punishment, but can he? I mean, he's the commander but let's skip back to season 1 where we see Ned Stark carry out the punishment and not the commander. </p>
","<game-of-thrones>","129440","<p>To your title question</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Who now governs the Night's Watch?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The answer is Eddison Tollett (aka ""Dolorous Edd""). Jon Snow gave him his position at the end of episode S06E03:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>EDD: We should burn the bodies.</p>
  
  <p>JON: You should.
  (Jon gives his cloak to Edd)</p>
  
  <p>EDD: What do you want me to do with this ?</p>
  
  <p>JON: Wear it. Burn it. Whatever you want. You have Castle Black.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Concerning Lord Eddard Stark; he never had any position within the Night's Watch. As stated by @TLP in the comments, he was only doing his duty as the Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. And there is still a Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North now: Lord Ramsay Bolton.</p>

"129474","How did Bran warg into the correct wolf to help Jon in ""The Rains of Castamere""?","<p>In the episode <em>The Rains of Castamere</em>, Bran and his entourage were hiding in a tower during a thunderstorm. Outside, Jon was fighting a few wildings. So, Jojen Reed looks out the window and sees a dire wolf that could help Jon. He tells Bran, and Bran then wargs into that wolf and saves Jon. Bran had no clue that a wolf was even outside the tower.</p>

<p>If Jojen had misidentified the dire wolf, might Bran have ended-up at Castle Black warged into Ghost? Or maybe some random dire wolf?</p>

<p>Can Bran only warg dire wolves and Hodor? Those 2 are obviously quite different.</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","129562","<p>Because Bran had no connection whatsoever with Ghost or any training on forging a connection with another beast.</p>

<h2>Why show can't answer this</h2>

<p>By show-only perspective, you won't get any answers because Show does not discuss the skin-changing lore in detail, does not provide a historical overview and does not give examples. </p>

<p>That is why we have to rely on books for this:</p>

<h2>Books Perspective</h2>

<p><strong><em>Bran could not call Greywind or Shaggydog away from Tyrion</em></strong></p>

<p>The Stark Children show the gift, at least Robb, Rickon, Arya, Jon and Bran do. When Tyrion Lannister was set upon by Stark wolves, Robb, Rickon and Bran all had to call their beasts off. No one among them could call other's beast off. As we saw in AGOT in Bran's POV:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“No!” Bran shouted from the high seat as Lannister’s men reached for
  their steel. <strong>“Summer, here. Summer, to me!”</strong></p>
  
  <p>The direwolf heard the voice, glanced at Bran, and again at Lannister.
  He crept backward, away from the little man, and settled down below
  Bran’s dangling feet.</p>
  
  <p>Robb had been holding his breath. He let it out with a sigh and
  called, <strong>“Grey Wind.”</strong> His direwolf moved to him, swift and silent. </p>
  
  <p>Now there was only Shaggydog, rumbling at the small man, his eyes
  burning like green fire. <strong>“Rickon, call him,” Bran shouted to his baby</strong>
  <strong>brother</strong>, and Rickon remembered himself and screamed, <strong>“Home, Shaggy,</strong>
  <strong>home now.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see, neither of them shared a bond with each others wolf and thus could not command any wolf other than their own to leave the Lannister alone. So if Bran could not control Shaggy dog or Greywind, we can assume he could never have controlled Ghost either. </p>

<p><strong><em>Distance between Ghost and Bran</em></strong></p>

<p>We know that distance between the canine-beast and the warg does not matter <strong>if the warg has already claimed the beast or has a bond with it</strong>. They have not shown this in the show, but in books during the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Great_ranging"" rel=""nofollow"">ranging beyond the wall</a> with Qhorin Halfhand, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Jon_Snow"" rel=""nofollow"">Jon</a> warged into Ghost in his sleep who was miles away and saw the Army of Wildlings. Also, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Arya_Stark"" rel=""nofollow"">Arya Stark</a> could connect with Nymeria's mind while being in Braavos but only if she was asleep. </p>

<p>But Jon was able to do that because he had a bond with ghost. Skinchangers can take as many beasts as they want (e.g. <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Varamyr"" rel=""nofollow"">Varamyr Sixskins</a>) but they have to fight the animal for control and form that bond. So in theory, Bran could warg into Ghost if he knew how to form the bond with him. </p>

<p>Bran was untrained by the time he saw Jon and when urged by Jojen, he warged using the only bond he had; That's with Summer. He had no bond with Ghost so I doubt he could even feel him, let alone slip into him.</p>

"129553","Is Ser Davos based on any historical figures?","<p>Obviously, George R. Martin draws heavily from medieval history in writing GoT; Lancasters become Lannisters, along with many other elements of pre-Tudor power struggles...but is our lovable onion knight based on any actual historical figures?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","129573","<p>There are a number of historical counterparts which can be associated with Davos. The most prominent comparison is likely that of Thomas Cromwell. </p>

<p>1) Both men were of common birth; with Davos coming from flea bottom, and Cromwell being the son of a blacksmith from Surrey. </p>

<p>2) Both men were largely disliked by the landed gentry </p>

<p>3) Both men acted as advisers to a strong willed king and spoke their views openly regarding issues facing their monarch. </p>

<p><a href=""http://englishhistory.net/tudor/thomas-cromwell/"">Thomas Cromwell</a></p>

<p>Davos's story is that of upward mobility; a quintessential example of the self made man.

<p>Davos's character seems to act more as a literary contrast to Littlefinger and Bronn than fill the role of a historical equivalent. Davos represents morality, Bronn is amoral, and Littlefinger immoral. </p>

<p>Davos doesn't crave growth or glory and only want to do the best for his king and his family, Bronn will take advantage of the opportunities when they arise, and Littlefinger actively craves more power. </p>

"129590","Why does Tywin hate Tyrion so much, right from Tyrion's birth?","<p>In Game of Thrones S03E10, immediately after learning that...</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Robb Stark has died,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...the following conversation takes place between Tywin Lannister and Tyrion Lannister:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> <strong>Tyrion</strong>: ...it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions.<br />
 <strong>Tywin</strong>: Easy for me, is it? <br />
 <strong>Tyrion</strong>: When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family? <br />
 <strong>Tywin</strong>: <strong><em>The day that you were born. I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away. Instead, I let you live. And I brought you as my son.</em></strong> Because you're a Lannister.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tyrion believes that his father's hatred for him is because he is a dwarf. This is evident from this statement from him to Jon Snow:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, dwarfism is not noticeable until the later years of childhood. There is no way Tywin could have known that Tyrion was going to be a dwarf. This is confirmed by this statement from Oberyn Martel from S04E07:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us. Every day we would ask. Every day she would say, ""Soon."" Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and... she unveiled the freak. <strong><em>Your head was a bit large. Your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw. No red eye. No tail between your legs. Just a tiny pink cock. We didn't try to hide our disappointment. ""That's not a monster,"" I told Cersei, ""that's just a baby.""</em></strong> ... </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this confirms that although Tyrion had minor deformities on birth, his physical appearance was mostly normal. That's not a reason to kill your own child, even by GoT universe standards.</p>

<p>So what caused Tywin Lannister to hate Tyrion so much right from his birth?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","129605","<p>One thing Tywin hated the most in the world was being laughed at since he endured that during his boyhood due to follies of his father Tytos Lannister. Yet once again, He became laughing stock of the realm when a malformed dwarf was born to him. To make things even more worse, the birth cost him his wife, Lady Joanna Lannister. Tywin never loved anything more than her.</p>

<p>He really explains why he hates Tyrion in <strong>season 3 episode 1, Valar Dohaeris</strong> when Tyrion asks for Casterly Rock and Tywin refuses it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tywin Lannister: I would let myself be consumed by maggots before
  mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock!</p>
  
  <p>Tyrion Lannister: [quietly] Why?</p>
  
  <p>Tywin Lannister: [raises his voice in anger] Why? You ask that? You
  who killed your mother to come into the world?</p>
  
  <p>[Tywin stands and approaches Tyrion, while talking to him
  contemptuously]</p>
  
  <p>Tywin Lannister: You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of
  envy, lust, and low cunning. Men's laws give you the right to bear my
  name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine.
  And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you
  waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and
  his father's before him. But neither gods nor men will ever compel me
  to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse. Go, now. Speak no
  more of your rights to Casterly Rock. Go!</p>
  
  <p>[Tywin returns to his seat. Tyrion is deeply hurt by his father's
  words, but says nothing. He stands and starts to leave]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you see in above mentioned dialogue, following are the reasons why he hates Tyrion:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong><em>You, who killed your mother to come into the world?</em></strong> - Tyrion's birth resulted in death of Tywin's one true love.</li>
<li><strong><em>You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature</em></strong> - He hated that Tyrion is malformed and does not fit the standard Tywin had for Lannisters - Being perfect and immaculate.</li>
<li><strong><em>I cannot prove that you are not mine</em></strong> - Tywin suspected Tyrion is not his son but in fact a bastard sired by another whose name you can find in spoiler at bottom.</li>
<li><strong><em>The gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him</em></strong> - Tywin hated that after all he had done to restore dignity to House Lannister, Tyrion once again made Lannisters a laughing stock by being born a dwarf.</li>
<li><strong><em>But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse</em></strong> - He hated that Tyrion is into whores. He hated the fact that Tyrion married a ""<a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Tysha"" rel=""noreferrer"">whore</a>"" in his teenage (Who actually turned out to be an innocent girl but Tywin deceived Tyrion that she was a whore.)</li>
<li><strong><em>Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock. Go!</em></strong> - Tywin could not allow Tyrion to have Casterly Rock because in his mind Jaime was still his heir, the heir stolen by mad king. He also dreaded that seating a dwarf in throne of the Kings of the Rock would spell the end of house Lannister as all vassals would mock &amp; defy such an overlord.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you wish to read my analysis of how did Tywin Lannister turn into that bitter and awful man from Books perspective, see <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/35038/has-tywin-lannister-ever-received-a-life-lesson/128378#128378"">my previous answer here</a>.

"269103","Who was Prince Viserys Targaryen (brother of Daenerys) named after?","<p>Viewers of <em>Game of Thrones</em> (2011) were introduced to Prince Viserys Targaryen, the brother of Daenerys Targaryen, and Rhaegar Targaryen. In the <em>Game of Thrones</em> prequel, <em>House of the Dragon</em> (2022), two Viseryses were also introduced: Viserys I Targaryen (father of Rhaenyra Targaryen), and Viserys II Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra Targaryen). Both Viseryses were kings that sat on the Iron Throne. Viserys II was Hand of the King to three kings before sitting on the Iron Throne. Prince Viserys styles himself as &quot;the Third of his Name&quot;,  acknowledging his two identically-named ancestors, one of which, he might be named after.</p>
<p>@TheLethalCarrot raises an interesting point in the comments about Daenerys:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We do, however, know that Dany was named after Daenerys Targaryen (daughter of Aegon IV) [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was wondering, was Prince Viserys, like Daenerys, named after one of their Targaryen ancestors? Which King Viserys did Prince Viserys Targaryen's parents, King Aerys II Targaryen and Queen Rhaella Targaryen, name him after — Viserys I, or Viserys II? Or, did they just like that name, and did not intend to name him after a prior Viserys?</p>
<p>I would like to know which Viserys (if any) was respected and deemed worthy by Prince Viserys' parents of being their son's namesake. This might also give us a hint of how the Westerosi viewed the two prior historical figures in comparison to each other.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><house-of-the-dragon>","269688","<h3>Canon Answer</h3>
<p>We do not know. There is no mention of who was Viserys III's namesake in the books. The main series makes no mention of it or Viserys' birth at all. Only account of his birth we see is in The World of Ice and Fire. And that itself makes no mention of who his namesake was.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His Grace’s new fidelity was apparently pleasing to the Mother Above, it must be said, for the following year, Queen Rhaella gave the king the second son that he had prayed for. Prince Viserys, born in 276 AC, was small but robust, and as beautiful a child as King’s Landing had ever seen.</p>
<p>Though Prince Rhaegar at seventeen was everything that could be wanted in an heir apparent, all Westeros rejoiced to know that at last he had a brother, another Targaryen to secure the succession. The birth of Prince Viserys only seemed to make Aerys II more fearful and obsessive, however. Though the new young princeling seemed healthy enough, the king was terrified lest he suffer the same fate as his brothers</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Speculation based on available information</h3>
<p>As you can see, there is no mention of why he was named as such. But we can use the other information in the chapter to speculate.</p>
<p>Queen Rhaella had two miscarriages and one stillborn before giving birth to Prince Daeron who died in infancy. This was followed by another stillbirth and another miscarriage. Then Prince Aegon was born two months premature and died in infancy. The King disowned all these children after their deaths and claimed they were bastards, struck down by Gods to secure sanctity of the throne by keeping bastards off it, presumably a coping mechanism for his grief. After that, Princess Shaena was also stillborn although Aerys never disowned her to our knowledge. She was followed by Prince Jaehaerys who also died in infancy. Viserys was born after Prince Jaehaerys.</p>
<p>As evident from his sons' names (Daeron, Aegon, Jaehaerys and Viserys), all of them share the names of previous Targaryen monarchs. Only Rhaegar had a unique name. In light of this info, <strong>we can reasonably speculate that Viserys was named after an illustrious ancestor like his dead brothers, not simply because the King liked the name</strong>.</p>
<p>Now that we have somewhat established he was indeed named after a King, we get to your question: Viserys I or Viserys II? We have to go to the main series to find impressions of the learned people of Westeros who are more or less contemporaries of Aerys II. The conversation between Prince Oberyn and Tyrion Lannister (ASOS - Sansa IV) on historical representation of Viserys II provides some insights:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I once had the great good fortune to see the Citadel's copy of Lives
of Four Kings,&quot; Prince Oberyn was telling her lord husband. &quot;The
illuminations were wondrous to behold, but <strong>Kaeth was too kind by half
to King Viserys</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>Tyrion gave him a sharp look. &quot;Too kind? <strong>He scants Viserys shamefully</strong>,
in my view. It should have been Lives of Five Kings.&quot;</p>
<p>The prince laughed. &quot;Viserys hardly reigned a fortnight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He reigned more than a year,&quot; said Tyrion.</p>
<p>Oberyn gave a shrug. &quot;A year or a fortnight, what does it matter? <strong>He
poisoned his own nephew to gain the throne and then did nothing once
he had it</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Baelor starved himself to death, fasting,&quot; said Tyrion. &quot;His uncle
served him loyally as Hand, as he had served the Young Dragon before
him. Viserys might only have reigned a year, but he ruled for fifteen,
while Daeron warred and Baelor prayed.&quot; He made a sour face. &quot;<strong>And if
he did remove his nephew, can you blame him? Someone had to save the
realm from Baelor's follies</strong>.&quot;</p>
<p>Sansa was shocked. &quot;But Baelor the Blessed was a great king. He walked
the Boneway barefoot to make peace with Dorne, and rescued the
Dragonknight from a snakepit. The vipers refused to strike him because
he was so pure and holy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My prince is playing with you, Lady Sansa,&quot; said the woman Ellaria
Sand. &quot;The septons and singers like to say that the snakes did not
bite Baelor, but the truth is very different. He was bitten half a
hundred times, and should have died from it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If he had, <strong>Viserys would have reigned a dozen years,&quot; said Tyrion,
&quot;and the Seven Kingdoms might have been better served</strong>. Some believe
Baelor was deranged by all that venom.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So here we can see that even among the learned circles (Both Oberyn and Tyrion are very well versed in History), Viserys II is a polarizing figure. It appears that people suspect him of kinslaying and consider him of little note due to his brief reign. Some like Tyrion however admire him for his long and successful tenure as the hand, prior to becoming the King. There is no similar impressions on Viserys I by the contemporaries of Aerys II so we must rely on the writings before his time. Viserys I is described in TWOIAF and F&amp;B in following words:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Viserys I Targaryen had a <strong>generous amiable nature</strong> and was <strong>well loved by his lords and smallfolk alike</strong>. The reign of the Young King, as the commons called him upon his ascent, was <strong>peaceful and prosperous</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Viserys I Targaryen was not the strongest-willed of kings, it must be said; always amiable and anxious to please, he relied <strong>greatly on the counsel of the men around him</strong> and did as they bid more oft than not.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>He had ruled for six-and-twenty years, reigning over the most prosperous era in the history of the Seven Kingdoms</strong> but seeding within it the disastrous decline of his house and the death of the last dragons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we can see that while Viserys I was not considered particularly strong-willed and decisive and somewhat blamed for the Dance in retrospect, he is still seen as the King who presided over the Golden era of Targaryen dynasty, ushering in a long period of peace, prosperity and justice for all.</p>
<p>In light of this information, <strong>we can reasonably speculate that Viserys III is named after Viserys I</strong>. Kinslaying is a big stigma and while some may argue that Royals may not have cared for public opinion, let us not forget that Prince Maegor (Son of Prince Aerion), lost his chance at the throne for a number of reasons, one of which was being named after Maegor the Cruel. Furthermore, Viserys II's actual reign was inconsequential so it wouldn't make sense for Aerys to name his second son after him.</p>
<p>In any case, it must be noted that it all in the end goes back to Viserys I as Viserys II himself was named by Rhaenyra for her father Viserys I.</p>

"129815","Does Randyll Tarly hate the wildlings in the books?","<p>In Game of Thrones S06 E06 <em>Blood of My Blood</em>, Randyll Tarly is extremely vocal in his hatred of wildlings. Do the books ever show or describe him as having such feelings towards them?</p>

<p>I ask because I was somewhat surprised by the scene. In general the seven kingdoms are disinterested in and have neglected the Night's Watch. Horn Hill is probably close to two thousand miles from The Wall, and a proud lord of the Reach like Randyll Tarly would not be concerned about the skirmishes between poor Northern houses and wildlings, or so I would've thought.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><adaptation-comparison>","129817","<p>In one word, Nope.</p>

<p>But seeing the kind of person Randyll Tarly is, he would be exactly the sort of guy who'd side with people advocating genocide of Wildlings or at least letting them die of their own accord. </p>

<p>Since the Tarlys dwell far in South, it is impossible that the Tarlys ever suffered from Wildling raiders in history so the Tarlys don't have any personal cause for hatred of Wildlings like <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Mors_Umber"">Mors Umber</a> does whose only daughter was abducted by raiders from beyond the wall. Randyll Tarly however strikes me as a man who would be Xenophobic so I suppose the only thing he feels for Wildlings is sheer contempt born out of xenophobia. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, at that time, Tarly was busy <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_at_Duskendale"">expelling Northmen</a> from Riverlands-Crownlands border regions , <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Taking_of_Maidenpool"">sorting out Maidenpool</a> and <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Eleanor_Mooton#A_Feast_for_Crows"">arranging the marriage of his son Dickon</a>. Later he was <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Randyll_Tarly#A_Feast_for_Crows"">moving on Kings Landing</a> in the aftermath of Margaery's arrest by The Faith while all the drama with the Wildling invasion and later resettlement was unfolding. </p>

<p>He never said anything about Wildlings. </p>

<p>Wildlings were a problem of the North and Warden of the North Roose Bolton. Tarly served the Warden of the South, Mace Tyrell. He had more pressing concerns like performing the duty of clearing the Riverlands from Bandits; which the Crown charged him with &amp; later of getting ready to free Queen Margaery, a duty he owed to his liege lord Mace Tyrell. As you correctly state, What happened thousands of leagues away in Northern wilderness was not his concern or in any way threatening for him. </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">

"65059","Do no hedge knights have last names?","<p>All the hedge knights that I can think of introduced in the series so far - Ser Illifer the Penniless, Ser Duncan the Tall, Ser Pate of the Blue Fork, Ser Shadrich of the Shady Glen, etc. - don't have last names, at least that we know of. The one exception I recall is Ser Creighton Longbough, but there is no mention of a House Longbough on AWOIAF, so this may be a name Ser Creighton has invented, not a House name.</p>

<p>I can't find any information that specifically precludes hedge knights from having House names. But (minor spoilers AFFC)</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> ""Knights they are,"" said Petyr. ""Their gallantry has yet to be demonstrated, but we may hope. Allow me to present Ser Byron, Ser Morgarth, and Ser Shadrich.

<p>Which seems to suggest that hedge knights as a rule don't have House names.</p>

<p>So my question is twofold:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is there a reason that none of the hedge knights we've met appear to have House names (Ser Creighton possibly notwithstanding)?</p></li>
<li><p>Could someone from a noble House become a hedge knight and retain their House name?</p></li>

It is only a nobleman, that belongs to a noble house, who can have a <em>proper</em> last name denoting his lineage. So Robb of house Stark is Robb Stark.</p>

<p>Now knights are in an interesting place. They have an honorific placed in front of their names, are a step above the commoners, but that honorific doesn't come with anything else. No lands, thus no noble house, thus no last name. So unless a knight is already of noble birth, he won't get a last name just by being knighted. </p>

<p>Hedge knights, by definition, are poor knights who are not sworn to any single lord on a permanent basis. The vast majority of them are of common stock, since nobly born knights tend to find employment easier with other nobles, which gives us a lot of knights living in the hedges with no last name. To give themselves proper <em>airs</em> most of those titleless knights adopt a qualifier of some sort to distinguish them. A home village (Ser Arlan of Pennytree), or a physical trait (Ser Duncan the Tall), and so on. </p>

"65128","When did Cersei have Robert's illegitimate children dealt with (in the books)?","<p>This is shown fairly explicit in the show: several members of the city guard are shown going about Kings Landing early in Season 2 (if I remember correctly), executing Robert Baratheon's illegitimate children, since they presumably have more right to the throne than Joffrey. Now in ACoK, this is much less obvious, as it is only referred to in a conversation between Tyrion and Janos, right before Tyrion dismisses Janos to the Wall. My question is this: when exactly in the timeline does the massacre of Robert's illegitimate children happen in the books? Apart from this conversation, there isn't much indication that the people of King's Landing have been distressed by this, until much later when we see their anger at Joffrey for being quite a lousy king in general. Was this massacre performed recently after Ned's execution, hence why Yoren brought Gendry with him to the Wall?</p>

  This was not the first time Cersei ordered the death of a bastard

<p>Yes, the executions took place after the death of Ned Stark(because Arya traveled with Yoren). But they happened , because Cersei was worried about the throne being taking in genereal and not because Joffrey was a bad king. She knew if the truth came out everyone was in danger.</p>

<p><strong><em>My personal Non-canon thoughts.</em></strong></p>

<p>I never thought that the bastards had a greater right to the throne than Joffrey. <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Bastardy"" rel=""noreferrer"">If Joffrey didn't get the throne then the throne would have been given to someone else.</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bastards are not allowed to inherit their father's lands or titles,
  and have no claims to the privileges of their father's House. It is up
  to their father on how to raise or treat them: at worst they are
  unacknowledged and ignored, though they may fare better and be
  discreetly sent funds to ensure their well-being. At best, a lord will
  acknowledge his bastard children (allowing them to take on one of the
  special bastard surnames), but send them away to one of his distant
  castles to be raised away from his lawful family.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean things might have differed as since it was a noble house, but there were many others who had stronger claims. And if the pureblood Baratheon son is the king, people are probably going to accept him and not the ""bastards"".And if they don't accept him its because they want to accept someone else, possibly a Barantheon brother, a Tangeryn, or maybe a Stark.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nevertheless, as a highborn bastard carries the blood of a noble
  house, they may still be perceived as a potential threat by rival
  claimants. For this reason, King Joffrey orders the massacre of all of
  his father's illegitimate offspring</p>

Why would he take this extremely risky move when he could instead have kept waiting for his powerful family to rescue him?</p>
<p>Tyrion may have assumed that his sword master brother would be able to stand as his champion, but this clearly was a miscalculation because his captor Lysa Arryn refused to delay the trial by the many days or weeks it would take for his brother to arrive.

<p>Perhaps his captors only meant to let him rot here, but he feared he did not have the strength to rot for long.

<p>Tyrion pushed himself to his feet, doing his best to ignore the slope of the floor beneath him, with its ever-so-subtle tug toward the edge. He hammered on the door with a fist. &quot;Mord!&quot; he shouted. &quot;Turnkey! Mord, I want you!&quot;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>(Emphasis mine.) But this doesn't say a huge amount. Is it indiscriminate - is every fighting man within the lord's lands taken as a soldier? Is it voluntary, or are soldiers conscripted? Do all able-bodied men within the families of the lord and his bannermen fight? I'm looking for more general information about how armies of Westeros are formed.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","65333","<p>Westeros uses a feudal system. Which means that each lord, high or low, has the responsibility of providing fighting men to his liege lord when the call comes. Willing volunteers are of course preferred, but they are often not enough when the conflict is large enough. So the lords conscript from their population. How they do that and how much men they take is up to the individual lord. Usually, it is only the lowest of the low who get conscripted. The unskilled workers, farmers and the poor who have no better prospects. Tradesmen, smiths and artisans are usually far too valuable to use as common soldiers. Which is why lords are usually keen on ending a campaign before harvest time comes, when most of their men would be yearning to go back to their farms. If a lord is rich enough he would bolster this army of smallfolk with his household knights, hedge knights and sellswords.</p>

<p>In the novella <em>Sworn Sword</em> we see this take action (albeit on a very small scale). Dunk and Ser Eustace round up a few able men from their lord's village. Only a few of whom had previous combat experience, and the rest just simple farmer boys who have nothing better to do.</p>

<p>Why? Looks like a smart move to me.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><weapon><money>","131260","<p>Let's rephrase the question: ""Why does no one take the murdered victim's sword to sell it?""</p>

<p>CSI doesn't really exist in the Game of Thrones world, so if there are no witnesses to your fight with an enemy, you normally can get away with it.
However, carrying the victim's belongings, especially something as valuable as a sword, will implicate you in the killing enough for anyone that wants you hanged to get you hanged as a murderer.</p>

"131259","How many Faceless Men are there?","<p>Considering that a Faceless Man is ""no-one"" and can change appearances at will, is there any mention of how large their order actually is? </p>

<p>For all we know it could just be two people: The Kindly Man and Waif.... </p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","131267","<h2>In the books, at least twelve</h2>
<p>In <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, Arya attends a meeting of eleven Faceless Men:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Eleven servants of the Many-Faced God gathered that night beneath the
temple, more than she had ever seen together at one time</strong>. Only the
lordling and the fat fellow arrived by the front door; the rest came
by secret ways, through tunnels and hidden passages. They wore their
robes of black and white, but as they took their seats each man pulled
his cowl down to show the face he had chosen to wear that day. Their
tall chairs were carved of ebony and weirwood, like the doors of the
temple above. The ebon chairs had weirwood faces on their backs, the
weirwood chairs faces of carved ebony.</p>
<p>—<em>A Dance with Dragons</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This group has some overlap with those Arya has seen before:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After three hours of wine and words, the priests took their leave …
all but <strong>the kindly man, the waif, and the one whose face bore the
marks of plague.</strong></p>
<p>—<em>A Dance with Dragons</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The text seems to indicate that Arya is not counting herself in this number, so that makes a dozen Faceless Men. <strong>We at least know that there are significantly more than two Faceless Men.</strong></p>
<p>Other possible or definite Faceless Men have appeared in the books. Samwell Tarly, for instance, met &quot;Pate&quot; after the real Pate had died, and thus &quot;Pate&quot; was probably a Faceless Man.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“My thanks.” There was something about the pale, soft youth that he
misliked, but he did not want to seem discourteous, so he added, “My
name’s not Slayer, truly. I’m Sam. Samwell Tarly.”</p>
<p>“I’m Pate,” the other said, “like the pig boy.”</p>
<p>—<em>A Feast for Crows</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, given that eleven is the maximum number of Faceless Men ever mentioned to be <em>in one place</em> at the same time, we cannot assume that there are more based on other individuals seen in the books, given the well-known propensity of the Faceless Men for disguise.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that the previous passage suggests that the Faceless Men are not much more numerous, since eleven is the most Arya has ever seen together.</p>
<h2>In the TV series, at least three</h2>
<p>In the TV series <em>Game of Thrones</em>, we know of three Faceless Men:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arya Stark</li>
<li>The Waif</li>
<li>&quot;Jaqen H'ghar&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Given that the Waif and Jaqen appear at the same time, we know they are different people. We can also assume that neither of them is Arya Stark, making three.</strong></p>

"131371","How did Ser Davos know about this name/title?","<p>In the seventh episode of the sixth season (S06E07), Ser Davos and his friends visit House Mormont. </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> When Jon Snow and Sansa fail to persuade Lady Mormont to aid them, Ser Davos appeals to her by talking about the Night King. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We know Jon Snow encountered the horned White Walker at Hardhome, but we have only heard Bran use the term ""Night King"" before. </p>

<p>Bran and Jon have not seen each other in a long time, so <strong>how do Jon Snow and Ser Davos know that the horned White Walker is named/titled the ""Night King""?</strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones>","131372","<h2>Folklore</h2>
<p>The Night's King is a well-known character. While the TV series may not have mentioned that title before, in the books it is clear that more people than Bran know of him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, Bran thought, but he walked in this castle, where we’ll sleep
tonight. He did not like that notion very much at all. Night’s King
was only a man by light of day, Old Nan would always say, but the
night was his to rule. And it’s getting dark.</p>
<p>—<em>A Storm of Swords</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Night's King is explicitly described as an entity mentioned in <em>stories</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The gathering gloom put Bran in mind of another of Old Nan’s stories,
the tale of Night’s King. He had been the thirteenth man to lead the
Night’s Watch, she said; a warrior who knew no fear.</p>
<p>—<em>A Storm of Swords</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given that Old Nan, who told Bran of the Night's King, has (so far as described in the books) no personal experience with the Night's King, nor (as a servant) access to any obscure texts, we can assume that this is a well-known tale.</p>
<p>Martin <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/12392"" rel=""noreferrer"">has said</a> that the Night's King may not be alive in the books,  but in doing so makes it clear that he is well-known:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As for the Night's King (the form I prefer), in the books he is <strong>a
legendary figure</strong>, akin to Lann the Clever and Brandon the Builder, and
no more likely to have survived to the present day than they have.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems reasonable to assume (in the absence of contradictory evidence) that something similar is true of the TV series: The Night's King is a well-known folkloric figure.</p>

"131381","Shouldn't the Dragons take action?","<p>Rhaegal and Viserion never took action to escape from where Daenerys locked them, they could easily melt the chains as we have seen before on the show. </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> And who ends up breaking free both is Tyrion</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there a reason for that?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","131398","<p>When you say ""as we have seen before on the show"" you are likely referring to Season 2 in the House of the Undying: 
<div class=""youtube-embed""><div>
                <iframe width=""640px"" height=""395px"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/KMvzfPDM3m0?start=0""></iframe>
            </div></div>  </p>

<p>The popular consensus here is that those chains were magical in nature, which is supported by the fact that the dragons did not melt them until the <a href=""https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-Daenerys-2-chained-dragons-burn-the-chains-down-and-get-themselves-free-if-dragons-breathe-fire"">death of Pyat Pree</a> (the necromancer).  </p>

<p>Furthermore, you should know in the books the Dragons were not set free manually, but instead broke free of their chains after using their breath to weaken (but not fully melt) the steel:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Viserion. Yes. Where is Viserion? The prince lowered his torch to throw some light into the gloom below. He could see the green dragon ripping at the smoking carcass of the sheep, his long tail lashing from side to side as he ate. A thick iron collar was visible about his neck, with three feet of <strong>broken</strong> chain dangling from it. Shattered links were strewn across the floor of the pit amongst the blackened bones—twists of metal, partly melted.   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regarding the characteristics of dragons, The Princess and The Queen, or, The Blacks and The Greens is a novella edited in part by George R. R. Martin.  It contains supplemental material for the world of Westeros and claims that it takes a fully grown dragon to melt steel and stone:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the same time, as the dragon grows older, its flames become hotter and fiercer. Where a hatchling's flame can set straw aflame, dragons, like Balerion and Vhagar in the fullness of their power, could melt steel and stone. It is said that dragons are fire made flesh.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>From this information it can be safely inferred that the dragons are not meant to be quite old enough to ""melt steel and stone"" with their breath, and the scene in Season 2 can be chalked up to magical mechanisms.  </p>

<p>Additionally, regarding the divergence: a viewer should consider the additional effect and trust that Tyrion releasing the dragons has likely generated, especially since he introduces himself as a friend of their mother.  It is a popular theory that Tyrion will eventually be the one <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/1yvtio/spoilers_adwd_tyrion_saddlemaker/"">to create saddles for the dragons</a>, and the show needed to establish rapport first so the eventual build up will make sense to show-only fans.</p>

"131422","What is the fight club theory?","<p>Please can anyone explain what is the ""fight club theory"" in Game of Thrones? And does this theory relate to the books in any way?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","131423","<p>I hadn't heard of this theory, but found it by Googling <em>&quot;fight club theory&quot; &quot;game of thrones&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>From TV Guide's <a href=""http://www.tvguide.com/news/game-of-thrones-arya-theories-explained/"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>Game of Thrones</em>: All the Crazy Arya Theories, Explained</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The <em>Fight Club</em> Theory:</strong> Some fans suggest that Arya and the Waif are not actually nemeses, but the same person, with the Waif being the Tyler Durden to Arya's Edward Norton. The meat of this theory is that the Waif and Arya represent her two possible paths - becoming No One and embracing her born identity - and that all the fights between Arya and the Waif are her inner struggles literalized. That would make the Waif's attack on Arya a (failed) last-ditch effort to kill her emotions and officially become No One.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>However, given the absurdity of this theory and the fact that the Waif is equally emotional as Arya, it doesn't quite line up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a reference to the 1999 film <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_Club"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>Fight Club</em></a>, and if you read Wikipedia's plot description you'll see why.</p>

<p>As for whether it relates to the books, you have to remember that <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> and <em>Game of Thrones</em> have considerably diverged at this point, and the show has moved beyond all the currently existing books. It may be that the theory will also be valid in the books; it may also be that it will be invalidated even in the show when the next episode airs.</p>

<p>In Season 6, they killed a whole group.</p>

<p>One reason could be that they had different religion. But is that the only reason for it?</p>

<p>I like to believe that this group may be different from the one Arya encountered. Or maybe since they are an army, they may have deployed small group of members to different parts of the continent to revolt against the nobles. And since they were not directly lead by Beric and Thoros, they seems to have lost its cause.</p>

<p>Is there only one group of the Brotherhood Without Banners, or maybe there is many?</p>

"65468","When to start watching HBO's Game of Thrones when reading the books?","<p>I've started reading George R. R. Martin's ""<em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>"" book series, and I intend to watch HBO's television series based on it at some point. I wonder about two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Should I start watching the series before having finished all the books? </li>
<li>If so, which chapters should I have read? What is a good starting point?</li>
</ul>

<p>The point is obviously avoiding spoilers.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","65476","<p>The 100% guaranteed way to ensure the show doesn't spoil anything from the books is to read them all first. That should go without saying, and that's the path I recommend. But if you insist on jumping into the show while you're still reading, here's a rough guide.</p>

<p>There's a pretty strong correlation between the first two books and the first two seasons. Season One, in particular, is almost a word-for-word adaptation in many parts. You could probably start watching those immediately after reading the respective books.</p>

<p>Season 3 is where things get tricky. Individual storylines differ in pacing. For example, Bran's <em>Storm of Swords</em> storyline is completely finished by the end of Season 3, while Jon Snow's only ends up about 1/3 completed. Things get even murkier in Season 4, when several characters start to make significant inroads to their <em>Feast for Crows</em>/<em>Dance with Dragons</em> storylines.</p>

<p>I'd recommend <em>at least</em> reading all the way through <em>Storm of Swords</em> before tacking Season Three, since Bran and Jaime's entire arc is in Season Three. In addition, episode one reveals something crucial about the character Arstan Whitebeard that is a mystery throughout the book.</p>

<p>But I strongly recommend reading <em>all</em> the books before starting Season Three. Season Three immediately reveals the fate of a major character whose fate is a mystery for two whole books.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Theon</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I definitely, definitely recommend reading all the books before Season Four. Dany, Bran, Brienne, and the spoilered character above all have parts of their <em>Feast for Crows</em>/<em>Dance with Dragons</em> storylines in that season.</p>

<p>EDIT: One thing I should add is that the show often makes things explicit which, in the books, are only hinted at or revealed over time. This happens as early as the first two seasons, in which much of ambiguity behind characters like Littlefinger and Margaery Tyrell are stripped away. They aren't spoilers, per se, but it could diminish your enjoyment in reading the books.</p>

And then they all started to laugh, they couldn't keep the game going any longer. They were toying with me. ‘Brienne the Beauty’, they called me. Great joke. And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive. A great lumbering beast. I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms. “Don't let them see your tears,” he told me. “They’re nasty little shits. The nasty little shits aren't worth crying over.” He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word. And he was the king's brother after all.</em></p>
<p><strong>PODRICK:</strong> <em>But wasn't he... Lord Tyrion said he was...</em></p>
<p><strong>BRIENNE:</strong> <em>Yes, Pod, he liked men, I'm not an idiot. He didn't love me, he didn't want me, he danced with me because he was kind and he wouldn't see me hurt. He saved me from being a joke. From that day until his last day. And I couldn't save him in return. <strong>Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love.

<p>However, in the books it is certainly a lot more explicit and she certainly loved him. Considering, as far as I’m aware, Brienne and Renly’s relationship is pretty much the same between the two canons I’d say it’s worth mentioning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;That is a lie.&quot; Renly Baratheon had been more than a king to her. She had loved him since first he came to Tarth on his leisurely lord's progress, to mark his coming of age. Her father welcomed him with a feast and commanded her to attend; elsewise she would have hidden in her room like some wounded beast. She had been no older than Sansa, more afraid of sniggers than of swords. They will know about the rose, she told Lord Selwyn, they will laugh at me. But the Evenstar would not relent.</p>

<p>Lord Renly was ahead of her, her sweet smiling king. He was leading her horse through the trees.

He always had a smile for me, she thought... except...</p>

  <p> If Jon Snow is Lyanna's child with Rhaegar, why would his claim to the Iron Throne come before Aegon Targaryen VI?<br /><br />Aegon is Rhaeger's real child born from the marriage bed with Elia, why would rumors think that Jon Snow has a better claim to the throne than Aegon?

  <p>Following the revelation that (in the TV series) Rhaegar's marriage to Elia was annulled and he married Lyanna Stark, as discovered by Gillie and witnessed by Bran, this theory is looking pretty good.</p>

<p>Aegon the Conqueror set the precedent for Targaryens to be permitted polygamy as well as incest by marrying both of his sisters.</p>

<p>And the other (and widely held) theory is that Aegon is not really Aegon but a deception perpetrated by Varys and Illyrio. It would take both of these to make Jon the rightful heir, since it's pretty certain that Aegon was born before Jon.</p>

"131614","Are there in-universe reasons reason why Dany wouldn't start her conquest in Dorne?","<p>Dorne is the closest place on Westeros to Slavers Bay, and Dany's biggest problem is getting fighters / horses / supplies across the Narrow Sea.</p>

<p>So, I'm thinking... <strong>(1)</strong> Dorne is vast and arrid. Aegon couldn't conquer Dorne because he needed long supply lines for his standing armies and the Dornish used guerrilla tactics to disrupt them. Well, Dany has the Dothraki who specialize in fighting in arrid climates.  <strong>(2)</strong> Further, many of the Unsullied need to do some killing (to be ""bled"") to finish their training. <strong>(3)</strong> Finally, the Dothraki / Unsullied / Second Sons / dragon army needs to learn how to function as a unit. Rather than quickly smash Dorne, they need to war game with the luxury of having live targets. War game until Dorne is smoldering rubble, then head north.</p>

<p>Any possible reason why Dany woudn't start her conquest of Westeros in Dorne? </p>
","<game-of-thrones>","131655","<p>There are multiple reasons why this would be a bad idea.</p>

<li>As you mentioned, Dorne is notoriously difficult to conquer. With dragons, the Targaryens had difficulty doing this the first time.</li>
</ul>

<p>From A Game of Thrones Chapter 5:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Daeren Targaryen was only fourteen when he conquered Dorne,” Jon said. The Young Dragon was one of his heroes. “A conquest that lasted a summer,” his uncle pointed out. “Your Boy King lost ten thousand men taking the place, and another fifty [thousand] trying to hold it. Someone should have told him that war isn’t a game.” He took another sip of wine. “Also,” he said, wiping his mouth, “Daeren Targaryen was only eighteen when he died. Or have you forgotten that part?”</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>Dorne is seperated from the rest of the Seven Kingdoms by a <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Red_Mountains"" rel=""nofollow"">mountain range.</a> This would need to be crossed.</p></li>

He whisked Sansa Stark away from the Lannisters, and while Sansa maintained her fake identity the Lannisters would have thought Littlefinger still loyal to them. But it's been many episodes since Littlefinger declared Sansa openly in the North, then the Boltons married her to Ramsay Bolton. And everything Roose Bolton and then Ramsay Bolton have done since then indicates that they intend to rule the North without allegiance to the Iron Throne.</p>

They haven't made any moves based on it, or even discussed the fact that that they've lost the Vale and most of the North again along with the allegiance of House Bolton.

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;And Stannis has always felt he was cheated of Storm's End,&quot; Cersei said thoughtfully. &quot;The ancestral seat of House Baratheon, his by rights... if you knew how many times he came to Robert singing that same dull song in that gloomy aggrieved tone he has. When Robert gave the place to Renly, Stannis clenched his jaw so tight I thought his teeth would shatter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He took it as a slight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It was meant as a slight,&quot; Cersei said.</p>
<p><sub>A Clash of Kings, Tyrion VI</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Certainly this is a timely conversation, as they have just received word that the two brothers are confronting each other. But, Cersei is just stating her opinion.</p>
<p>Is there any evidence one way or another that Robert intended to slight Stannis by giving him Dragonstone instead of Storm's End?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","65705","<p>There are many reasons given for why Robert gave Stannis Dragonstone, and all of them are plausible. It's possible the first two reasons I list informed Robert's decision, but the last one is definitely true according to George R.R. Martin.</p>

<p><strong>As a slight</strong>- Robert clearly didn't like Stannis all that much, and the feeling was mutual. But at the same time, he also says he never cared all that much for Renly, either. So it isn't clear why he would stiff his adult brother in favor of a much younger brother he disliked slightly less (especially given Stannis' excellent job in defending Storm's End throughout the war).</p>

<p>Stannis and Cersei both think this is the reason why Stannis was given Dragonstone. In particular, Stannis believes that Robert blamed him for letting Viserys and Dany escape the fortress. </p>

<p><strong>Practicality</strong>- Dragonstone was a hotbed of Targeryen loyalists, and their ancestral seat before Aegon's Conquest. One reason given for Stannis' appointment as Lord of Dragonstone was that it needed a strong head to watch over it. In addition, Stannis was Robert's master of ships. It makes sense that he'd be positioned at the island that has traditionally protected King's Landing from naval invasions.</p>

<p>This seems to be the reason Robert gave to Stannis:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I never asked for Dragonstone. I never wanted it. I took it because Robert’s enemies were here and he commanded me to root them out. I built his fleet and did his work, dutifully as a younger brother should be to an elder, as Renly should be to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>To honor him</strong>- Believe it or not, this is the canon reason. Dragonstone was traditionally given to the Targeryen prince who would one day rule the realm. That why Rhaegar Targeryan (and Baelor in <em>The Hedge Knight</em>) was styled the ""Prince of Dragonstone"" . So by granting Stannis Dragonstone, Robert intended to designate him heir to the throne, before Joffrey came into the picture.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/The_Baratheon_Brothers/"">From the mouth of GRRM</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stannis always resented being given Dragonstone while Renly got Storm's End, and took that as a slight... but it's not necessarily true that Robert meant it that way. The Targaryen heir apparent had always been titled Prince of Dragonstone. By making Stannis the Lord of Dragonstone, Robert affirmed his brother's status as heir (which he was, until Joff's birth a few years later). Robert could just as lawfully retained both castles for his sons, and made Joffrey the Prince of Dragonstone and Tommen the Lord of Storm's End. Giving them to his brothers instead was another instance of his great, but rather careless, generosity.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Sandor is wounded in the riverlands, and Arya leaves him there to die.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But is that it? What happens to him afterwards?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","65753","<p>We find out what happened to Sandor ""The Hound"" Clegane in a Brienne chapter in <em>A Feast for Crows</em>. We are first served some clues, then told outright. First we see Sandor's horse, <em>Stranger</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Way down at the far end [of the stables], well away from the other animals, a huge black stallion trumpeted at the sound of their voices and kicked at the door of his stall.<br>
  Ser Hyle gave the big horse an admiring look as he was handing his reins to Brother Gilliam. ""A handsome beast.""<br>
  Brother Narbert sighed. ""The Seven send us blessings, and the Seven send us trials. Handsome he might be, but Driftwood was surely whelped in hell. When we sought to harness him to a plow he kicked Brother Rawney and broke his shinbone in two places. We had hoped gelding might improve the beast's ill temper, but... Brother Gilliam, will you show them?""<br>
  [shows the horse bit off his ear]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then we see Sandor himself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...and higher still they passed a lichyard where a brother bigger than Brienne was struggling to dig a grave. From the way he moved, it was plain to see that he was lame. As he flung a spadeful of the stony soil over one shoulder, some chanced to spatter against their feet. ""Be more watchful there,"" chided Brother Narbert. ""Septon Meribald might have gotten a mouthful of dirt."" The gravedigger lowered his head. When Dog [Septon Meribald's dog] went to sniff him he dropped his spade and scratched his ear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And later on, clues of the Elder Brother's involvement with Sandor:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unlike Septon Narbert, the Elder Brother did not seem dismayed by Brienne's sex, but his smile did flicker and fade when the septon told them why she and Ser Hyle had come. ""I see,"" was all he said, ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We get confirmation that the Elder Brother has met Sandor:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...There is one thing I do know, however. The man you hunt is dead.""<br>
  That was another shock. ""How did he die?""<br>
  ""By the sword, as he had lived.""<br>
  ""You know this for a certainty?""<br>
  ""I buried him myself. I can tell you where his grave lies, if you wish. I covered him with stones to keep the carrion eaters from digging up his flesh, and set his helm atop the cairn to mark his final resting place. That was a grievous error. Some other wayfarer found my marker and claimed it for himself. The man who raped and killed at Saltpans was not Sandor Clegane, though he may be as dangerous. [Note: It was Rorge]<br>
  ...<br>
  I know little of this man, Sandor Clegane, ...<br></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The brother claims that ""The Hound"" is dead, but when reading between the lines, it is clear that what he means is that Sandor Clegane has left his violent persona behind him.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... The Hound died there, in my arms. You may have seen a big black stallion in our stables. That was his warhorse, Stranger. A blasphemous name. We prefer to call him Driftwood, as he was found beside the river.<br>
  ...<br>
  ...""It is true, then."" [Brienne] said dully. ""Sandor Clegane is dead."" <br>
  ""He is at rest."" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Elder Brother then relates a story about himself being a knight, and being wounded on the Trident during the famous Battle of the Trident between Robert and Rhaegar, and finding his way to the Quiet Isle, where he found redemption. He finishes with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I see."" Brienne did not know why he was telling her all of this, or what else she ought to say.<br>
  ""Do you?"" He leaned forward, his big hands on his knees. ""If so, give up this quest of yours. The Hound is dead, and in any case he never had your Sansa Stark.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is clear that Sandor lives, when reading this chapter. One can only hope that he does not stay there for a decade, like the Elder Brother. My personal hope is that he is reunited with one of the main characters, and becomes their guardian, preferably Sansa. Others have theorized that he will become a champion of the Light, and fight UnGregor in Cersei's Trial by Combat. Whatever the outcome, it is sure to be interesting.</p>

"131719","Why would the Faceless Men let Arya go?","<p>Jaqen and Arya have a special bond since the day Arya saved him. She gets invited in to the Faceless Men and receives training.

When the Waif reports back to Jaqen that Arya has failed, we see that he is disappointed and he only says ""Shame, the girl had many gifts"". He goes back to his 'work', only to be interrupted by the Waif who wants to go assassinate her, he only gives a nod and adds not to let her suffer. So he wasn't the one to give a hit order on Arya.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>Arya kills the Waif, then goes after Jaqen, she tells him ""A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell and I am going home"". To which Jaqen smiles, almost as if that was what he intended when he trained Arya.</p>

<p>Supposing there is a hidden assassin group, I doubt they will recruit someone, train that someone, and would allow that someone to leave when they want to leave with all the investment the group has put into training that someone. Not to mention the secrets that someone would be taking with them. Unless that was their intention in the first place.</p>

<p>Jaqen could easily kill Arya, even if she had a sword pointed at his heart.</p>

<p>Why would he let her go?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","131721","<p>My assumption, and this is only an educated guess, is that:</p>

<p>Jaqen knows full well that Arya cannot become ""no-one"" whilst she is still set on revenge for the murder of her family. He knows that it's against the rules to allow her to borrow a face to go and assassinate the people on her list. </p>

<p>Whilst Arya is still someone (i.e. she kept her sword, etc...) she will not kill someone just because she has been commanded to. It's almost like Jaqen wants her not to forget who she is, and where she came from - for example, by making her go and see the play which members of her family are involved in. </p>

<p>I think that Jaqen has not fully let go of Arya. He sees something within her, and when she came to be with the Faceless Men, he truly believed that she was ready, but it turned out she wasn't. I imagine that he thinks that by letting her go, she will get revenge for her family, and then she can truly become no-one. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While convalescing at Harrenhal, Jaime Lannister reveals to Brienne of

  because he was planning on burning the entire capital city to ashes

  appear that the rebels would win the war, <strong>the Mad King had his
  pyromancers hide caches of wildfire all over King's Landing - under
  the Great Sept of Baelor</strong>, under the slums of Flea Bottom, under
  houses, stables, taverns, and even under the Red Keep itself.</p>

<p>There's a bit of fore-warning in Jaime's words elsewhere in the episode, in his conversation with Edmure Tully:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In ""The Winds of Winter"", the season six finale (S06E10), we learn what rumors Qyburn and Cersei referred to:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Ser Gregor Clegane prevents King Tommen from leaving the royal palace to attend the trial of Ser Loras Tyrell and Cersei Lannister in the Great Sept of Baelor. Queen Margaery Tyrell, Lord Mace Tyrell, and Ser Kevan Lannister are already there amongst many spectators, as well as the High Sparrow. <br />
 <br />
 Finally the Sparrows bring Ser Loras in. After his trial is done, Lancel tells the High Sparrow that Cersei has yet to leave the Red Keep, so the High Sparrow asks him to go retrieve her. As Lancel is walking out, <strong>one of the ""little birds"" lures him away into the area below the Sept. There, Lancel discovers a cache of wildfire about to be set off.</strong><br />
 <br />
 Margaery, realizing something is very wrong with the fact that neither Cersei nor Tommen are at the trial, confronts the High Sparrow. She tells him that it's a trap, but he does not listen. Margaery tells everyone in the Sept they need to leave immediately, but the Faith Militant prevent anyone from exiting. <strong>Lancel does not make it to the wildfire in time, and the Sept explodes, killing everyone inside and outside of it as well as levelling most of the surrounding area.</strong></p>

Surely if the High Sparrow has enough influence on Tommen to get him to make the above decision he would be able to persuade him that the Kingsguard should only be guarding the king and protecting the Faith in this time unrest? <strong>So why is Kingsguard still protecting Cersei?</strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones>","131775","<p>In the books, it is explained that the first and foremost mission of the Kingsguard is to protect the King. However, the King can more or less use them as he wants. This means he can chose to assign members of the Kingsguard to the protection of other members of his family, like Cersei, Myrcella with Arys Oakheart in the books, or Mace Tyrell with Meryn Trant when he goes to Braavos in Season 5. So Tommen could also decide to tell Gregor Clegane to stop protecting Cersei. I see three possible reasons not to do so :</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It seems that Cersei controls Gregor Clegane, so I'm not really sure he'd obey Tommen. Tommen may also not trust a half dead man kept alive by obscure experimentations performed by a guy so creepy he was fired from the Citadel.</p></li>
<li><p>He still wants his mother to be protected. After all, he cares about her, and she's quite underappreciated at the moment.</p></li>
<li><p>He wants to have one of his knights keeping an eye on Cersei to know what she's scheming (quite unlikely, considering 1.).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As for other members of the Kingsguard, we have not seen any other in the show since Meryn Trant died, at least as far as I remember ; and I'm not sure the precise current members have ever been identified, apart from Gregor Clegane (and Jaime before his exclusion).</p>

"131792","The Mountain has no insignia of his breast plate? What is his official role?","<p>What is the Mountain's official role now?</p>

<p>The Mountain dresses like Kings Guard, yet he has no insignia (let alone 7-star insignia) on his breast plate. So, is his official title ""<em>Kings Guard</em> who is protecting the king's mother but who does not wear an insignia like all the other <em>Kings Guard</em>""?</p>

<p>Remember Qyburn saved the Mountain from near death after his killing Prince Oberyn. He used steroids (or something) that made him even stronger.

","<game-of-thrones>","131825","<p>What is the Mountain's official role now? The simple answer is: King's Guard. According to Qyburn in S5E10, ""May I have the honor of presenting the newest member of the King's Guard,"" referring to the resurrected Mountain. Note the breastplate.</p>

"131815","If a Faceless Man killed someone who is then brought back to life, does it count?","<p>I was wondering if there was any canon that would lead one to believe one way or the other. Since the Many-Faced demands a life and one was taken, has the Faceless Man fulfilled his task? Or, since the Many-Faced God is <em>all</em> gods, does R'hollor's allowing him/her to come back just cancel it out?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","131843","<p>No, as of now, there is no canon information from the books in this regard because there has never been a case where a man killed by Faceless men was resurrected by priests of R'hllor. </p>

<p>Therefore the following answer will be informed speculation, based on reasoning from canon material:</p>

<h2>Who gets resurrected by R'hllor?</h2>

<p>R'hllor does not grant his gift of a second chance at life to everyone. Only those people are sent back for whom he still holds some purpose in life. The only known resurrection cases in the books are Lord <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Beric_Dondarrion"">Beric Dondarrion</a> and Lady <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Catelyn_Tully"">Catelyn Stark</a>. </p>

<p>From A Storm of Swords, Chapter 39, Arya's POV:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Could you bring back a man without a head?” Arya asked. “Just the
  once, not six times. Could you?”</p>
  
  <p>“I have no magic, child. Only prayers. That first time, his lordship
  had a hole right through him and blood in his mouth, I knew there was
  no hope. So when his poor torn chest stopped moving, I gave him the
  good god’s own kiss to send him on his way. I filled my mouth with
  fire and breathed the flames inside him, down his throat to lungs and
  heart and soul. The last kiss it is called, and <strong>many a time I saw the</strong>
  <strong>old priests bestow it on the Lord’s servants as they died</strong>. <strong>I had given</strong>
  <strong>it a time or two myself, as all priests must.</strong> But never before had I
  felt a dead man shudder as the fire filled him, nor seen his eyes come
  open. <strong>It was not me who raised him, my lady. It was the Lord.
  R’hllor is not done with him yet</strong>. Life is warmth, and warmth is
  fire, and fire is God’s and God’s alone.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see, Thoros of Myr had performed the ritual many time and it never resurrected anyone. But when he did it with Beric Dondarrion, he rose up. Because R'hllor was not done with him yet. </p>

<p>It is highly unlikely that someone chosen to be killed by FM would also turn out to be someone who was chosen by R'hllor to do something. It is also unlikely that a man slain by faceless men would have a Red priest around to perform the ritual. </p>

<h2>Red God's due &amp; beliefs of Facelessmen</h2>

<p>Jaqen said to Arya:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The Red God has his due, sweet girl, and only death may pay for life. This girl took three that were his. This girl must give three in
  their places.</strong> Speak the names, and a man will do the rest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in order to repay a debt of life, Faceless Men have to pay back with equal number of lives. </p>

<p>Faceless men give death as a gift. It is not a duty or anything else in literal sense of a duty. Someone goes to their temple and pays ridiculous costs for the gift (Either for himself or someone else) &amp; faceless men handle the rest. If they kill someone and he dies, duty of the Faceless men is done. They have given the gift and that's all what matters. </p>

<p>In AFFC, The Kindly Man tells Arya:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“And many names,” the kindly man had said. “In Qohor he is the Black
  Goat, in Yi Ti the Lion of Night, in Westeros the Stranger. <strong>All men
  must bow to him in the end, no matter if they worship the Seven or the
  Lord of Light</strong>, the Moon Mother or the Drowned God or the Great
  Shepherd. All mankind belongs to him... else somewhere in the world
  would be a folk who lived forever. Do you know of any folk who live
  forever?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The correlation between Many Faced God and R'hllor can be stated as ambigious from this source. It is not clear whether they consider R'hllor as another face of MFG or do they consider him a distinct deity. Nevertheless, If they gave the gift to their target and he died, their job is done. They bargained for one life &amp; one life was taken. If R'hllor gives a new life to their target, it should not be any of their concern. The Faceless Men take the count of the slain very seriously (Though exceptions are made if their own life is threatened). From ACOK, When Arya threatens to name Jaqen if he did not help her free the Northmen, He says that it would mean more than three deaths and gods will not be pleased. Nevertheless he agrees after Arya's threat. Afterwards, he said this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I take back the name.” Arya chewed her lip. “Do I still have a third
  death?”</p>
  
  <p>“A girl is greedy.” Jaqen touched one of the dead guards and showed
  her his bloody fingers. “Here is three and there is four and eight
  more lie dead below. The debt is paid.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In conclusion no I don't believe that FM would take a hit on a resurrected man because they have done their job of giving the gift already. If the man is dead, that's good enough for them. </p>

<p>Also, resurrection after death is considered a new life (In show canon), Which is evident because Jon considered himself free of Night's Watch vows after he was resurrected.</p>

"131881","Can reborn Azor Ahai and the Prince that was promised be different persons?","<p>Some people assert that the prophecies about <em>reborn Azor Ahai</em> and <em>The Prince That Was Promised</em> are talking about the same person, but <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Azor_Ahai#Azor_Ahai_come_again"" rel=""nofollow"">Websites</a> which state that it could be the same person, don't list much references.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/The_prince_that_was_promised#Signs_of_the_coming_of_the_prince_that_was_promised"" rel=""nofollow"">prophecy about The Prince That Was Promised is very specific</a>, while the other one isn't:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There will come a day after a long summer when the stars bleed and the cold breath of darkness falls heavy on the world. In this dread hour a warrior shall draw from the fire a burning sword. And that sword shall be Lightbringer, the Red Sword of Heroes, and he who clasps it shall be Azor Ahai come again, and the darkness shall flee before him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In season 6's seventh and eighth episodes it looks like another person is directed to becoming Azor Ahai's revenant.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> The Hound is affected by fire since his childhood, he survived a trial by battle against reviving Beric Dondarrion, he is still living because a priest healed him and now it's very likely that he joins R'hllor's forces besides the Red Priest. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So is it possible that reborn Azor Ahai and The Prince That Was Promised are two different persons? Or what is the evidence that it's the same person?</p>

<p>Clarification: I'm only asking about the prophecies, not about who the person(s) will be.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","131944","<p>Yes both prophecies refer to the same figure with different names. Following is the evidence:</p>

<h2>Role of different cultures and their languages</h2>

<p>Azor Ahai and Prince that was promised apparently refer to same prophetic figure. They are just different names used by different cultures to refer to one supposed figure who would lead the men into Battle for the Dawn. People of Asshai call him Azor Ahai and People of Westeros call him Prince that was promised.</p>

<p>According to the World of Ice and Fire, In some other culture, legends point to the same figure with different names such as Hyrkoon the Hero, Yin Tar, Neferion, and Eldric Shadowchaser.</p>

<h2>Melisandre's conversation with Maester Aemon</h2>

<p>There is not much information available about TPTWP as compared to AA. By the description she gave for Azor Ahai's duty, Maester Aemon quickly knew that she was talking about TPTWP and Battle for the Dawn. </p>

<p>From ASOS, Chapter 78, Sam's POV:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Swords alone cannot hold this darkness back. Only the light of the
  Lord can do that. Make no mistake, good sers and valiant brothers, the
  war we’ve come to fight is no petty squabble over lands and honors.
  Ours is a war for life itself, and should we fail the world dies with
  us.”</p>
  
  <p>The officers did not know how to take that, Sam could see. Bowen Marsh
  and Othell Yarwyck exchanged a doubtful look, Janos Slynt was fuming,
  and Three-Finger Hobb looked as though he would sooner be back
  chopping carrots. </p>
  
  <p>But all of them seemed surprised to hear Maester Aemon murmur, “<strong>It
  is the war for the dawn you speak of, my lady. But where is the prince
  that was promised?</strong>”</p>
  
  <p>“<strong>He stands before you</strong>,” Melisandre declared, “though you do not have
  the eyes to see. <strong>Stannis Baratheon is Azor Ahai come again, the
  warrior of fire. In him the prophecies are fulfilled. The red comet
  blazed across the sky to herald his coming, and he bears Lightbringer,
  the red sword of heroes.</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice that Aemon asked who was TPTWP. Mel replied that Stannis was Azor Ahai. Which means they must be the same person. Later Maester Aemon does not say that if they are different figures or not, he just asks to see Stannis's magical sword Light Bringer. He saw it and left. Afterwards when he was dying, He told Sam this, In AFFC Chapter 35:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The sword is wrong, she has to know that ... light without heat ... an
  empty glamour ... the sword is wrong, and the false light can only
  lead us deeper into darkness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He did not say that Melisandre was wrong to consider AA and TPTWP to be same persons, He just says that she has the sword wrong. Which means that TPTWP must also posses the same sword and characteristics.</p>

<h2>The Sword</h2>

<p>By what we know of TPTWP, We know that he must be a Warrior, so he must need a sword. Back when Rhaegar used to think he was TPTWP, he said this to Master-at-arms of KL:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I will require a sword and armor. It seems I must be a warrior.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And we know AA forged his own magical sword to slay the darkness (By plunging the sword into heart of his beloved wife to temper it). </p>

<h2>So Spake Martin</h2>

<p>In GoT Season-2 DVD Extras GRRM also used the word in a similar way. He said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He [Stannis] is discarding the gods that he has worshiped since his
  childhood and accepting the red god and giving himself to the lord of
  light. And in return, <strong>Melisandre sees that the lord of light gives
  him a token of his role as the prince that was promised by an ancient
  prophecy</strong>. And of course, that's his sword Lightbringer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice that Mel usually refers to Stannis as Azor Ahai, but George states that Mel sees him as TPTWP. That should clear it all up.</p>

"131915","Is Jaqen breaking the rules when he gives Arya the coin?","<p>In <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2112510/"">Season 2 Episode 10</a> , Jaqen says to Arya</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""To be a dancing master is a special thing, but... to be a Faceless Man... that is something else entirely. A girl has many names on her lips. Joffrey. Cersei. Tywin Lannister. Ilyn Payne. The Hound. Names to offer up to the Red God. She could offer them all. One by one."" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>By this, it seems that he is willing to allow Arya to use the House of Black and White for training in the art of 'giving the gift of the Many-Faced God' to kill for her own ends, but in the name of the god. It seems like it would go against his beliefs. </p>

<p>Any insight?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","131947","<p>Axelrod has provided a comprehensive answer, I will compound on that. </p>

<p>It's all there in the quote you mentioned:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""To be a dancing master is a special thing, but... to be a Faceless
  Man... that is something else entirely. A girl has many names on her
  lips. Joffrey. Cersei. Tywin Lannister. Ilyn Payne. The Hound. <strong>Names
  to offer up to the Red God. She could offer them all. One by one.</strong>""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jaqen is not breaking any rules by telling Arya that she can offer the names to the Many Faced God. He is not telling her that she can go kill them herself just like that or that she can use the order's training to achieve her goals. He is specifically telling her to follow the due process of offering the names and in an implied way pay the due price for each of the murder (Because that's what you gotta do when you offer a name).</p>

<p>The price is always the part of the said ""gift"". Anyone can ask for the gift of death either for himself, his loved ones or his enemies. Then the Faceless Men tell him the price to give that gift. One crucial aspect of the price is that it is always something that the applicant can pay, there is no fixed price list. </p>

<p>George R.R. Martin <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/The_Cost_of_Faceless_Men"">explained it in this way</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Faceless Men don't post a list of prices on their door. The way it
  works, you go to them and tell them who you want killed, and then they
  negotiate the price. The more prominent the victim, the more difficult
  to get to, the more dangerous for the assassin and the guild, the
  higher the price</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Price is also explained in story of the Waif in AFFC Chapter 34, Cat of the Canals:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I was born the only child of an ancient House, my noble father’s
  heir,” the waif replied. “My mother died when I was little, I have no
  memory of her. When I was six my father wed again. His new wife
  treated me kindly until she gave birth to a daughter of her own. Then
  it was her wish that I should die, so her own blood might inherit my
  father’s wealth. <strong>She should have sought the favor of the Many-Faced
  God, but she could not bear the sacrifice he would ask of her</strong>.
  Instead, she thought to poison me herself. It left me as you see me
  now, but I did not die. <strong>When the healers in the House of the Red
  Hands told my father what she had done, he came here and made
  sacrifice, offering up all his wealth and me. Him of Many Faces heard
  his prayer. I was brought to the temple to serve, and my father’s wife
  received the gift</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it is clear that Price is steep enough to make any applicant reconsider his request but it is always within the means of the applicant. Waif's stepmother could not pay the price. But her father offered all his wealth and his daughter as a servant for the gift of death for his wife. The FLM accepted his offering and killed his wife. Later Waif confirmed that FLM did not ask for all the wealth of her father, they just asked for his 2/3rd wealth and his daughter as price. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>She had been watching the waif’s face the whole time she told her
  story, but the other girl had shown her no signs. </p>
  
  <p>“The Many-Faced God took two-thirds of your father’s wealth, not all.” </p>
  
  <p>“Just so. That was my exaggeration.”</p>

<h2>Did they have an exit strategy?</h2>

<p>No they did not have an exit strategy. They were there to finish the show. </p>

<p><strong>Original Plan of Starks</strong></p>

<p>Original plan of Starks was explained in Jon's War council:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jon: We're digging trenches all along our flanks. They won't be able
  to hit us the way that Stannis hit you[Wildlings], in a double
  envelopment. A pincer move. They won't be able to hit us from the
  sides. </p>
  
  <p>Tormund: Good. </p>
  
  <p>Davos: It's crucial that we let them charge at us. They've got the
  numbers, we need the patience. If we let him buckle our center, he'll
  pursue. Then we'll have him surrounded on three sides.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Jon's vulnerability and Ramsay's plan</strong></p>

<p>Jon however got emotional when Ramsay threw the bait of releasing Rickon. He pissed on the sound plan and rode head on, forcing his soldiers to abandon their fortified positions and follow Jon. You have to give Sansa this, she was not emotional. She knew Rickon was marked for death and had given him up for the dead. Jon however was still the boy Maester Aemon advised him to kill. </p>

<p>Ramsay knew about his weakness and planned to use it. He wanted to draw him out, envelop his army and destroy the Stark threat once and for all.</p>

<p><strong>The Battle</strong></p>

<p>Battle turned sour as Starks were at complete disadvantage in head-on battle and eventually they were surrounded from three sides by Northmen and on their rear was the pile of corpses. Umbers specifically moved from there to start cutting down the broken Stark men with element of surprise.</p>

<p>Starks by then were finished and were just waiting to be cut down. </p>

<p><strong>Hammer and Anvil</strong></p>

<p>That's when Ramsay decided to deploy the Classic strategy of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammer_and_anvil"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>Hammer and Anvil</strong></a>. Ramsay wanted to draw Jon out of his crude fortifications so that he could use his numbers and horses for advantage. He used Rickon to draw Jon out and it worked, Jon moved into the trap like the idiot that he is. As <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeroy_Jenkins#Video"" rel=""noreferrer"">this meme</a> puts it: </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YrguM.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/YrguM.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Ultimately came the moment when Starks were surrounded by Boltons and pinned down against the corpse wall. Bolton infantry formed shield walls in three directions and started pushing the Starks back to their doom. The Anvil was ready.</p>

<p>Ramsay had counted on this, he had planned this. Then he turns to Lord Umber (Whom I won't be calling Small Jon out of respect for the books' character) and says this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>It's time, go.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's when Lord Umber becomes the Hammer to crush the Starks between his forces and the Anvil of the surrounding Bolton infantry. </p>

<h2>But they will get killed by spears of friendly Forces?</h2>

<p>Correct, the risk of friendly casualties is always present in Hammer and Anvil tactics like all the other tactics. If there was no hammer, Starks would be left alone to try and break the shield wall. When Umber came, that's precisely what Starks were trying to do. Umber's attack made the Starks panic and had impact on their morale. </p>

<p><strong>Difference in morals of fighting sides</strong></p>

<p>It's not like Ramsay had any concern for loss of human life, soldiers were expendables. </p>

<p>Ser Davos forbade his soldiers to shoot arrows during the battle because that would have resulted in friendly fire:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Man: Draw!<br>
  Davos: We'll just kill our own men. Stand down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But Ramsay had no such concerns and throughout the battle, Bolton arrows kept coming, falling on friend and foe alike. </p>

<p>But why would Umber risk his life? A Man who does nothing in battle risks his life as well. By attacking, he had a chance to quickly put an end to the battle. It was very likely that they would slaughter the Starks from the back long before Infantry managed to reach the Bridge, seeing as Stark men were broken. </p>

","<game-of-thrones>","132475","<p>Ignorning that this is a speculative question which may result into opinion based answers, The answer is a solid No.</p>

<h2>The dangerous Line of advance</h2>

<p>Jon Snow's Army would have to march all the way down south through Moat Calin. There they will need to cross the river Trident either from the Twins or from Ruby ford.</p>

<p>Freys would most likely learn of this advance and alert the besiegers. Jaime would then move to Ruby Ford, forcing the Starks to fight either the strong fortifications of Twins or break themselves on Ruby Ford like Roose Bolton broke himself there against Tywin Lannister when Robb came south. </p>

<p>Ignore the positions of Armies on this map, it is just a map I created for another answer, But as you can see Jon will have to follow Kingsroad southwards and then to reach riverrun, he has to cross the river some how. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/B3PAO.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/B3PAO.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<h2>Uncertain hold on North</h2>

<p>They have won the castle of Winterfell but war is far from over. They have to consolidate their rule. There are many houses in North who willingly supported the Boltons, chief among them are powerful houses of Umbers and Karstarks. Jon first needs to consolidate his rule on the Northmen which will be especially tough because Northmen or any Westerosi people have never had a bastard as King. There would be many who will doubt his ability to rule. </p>

<h2>Riverlords and Wildlings</h2>

<p>The River lords who might otherwise rise for Sansa or Robin Arryn may rise up against Jon because he is bringing wildlings with him. The Lords of the Seven kingdoms have nothing but contempt for the Wildlings. The prospects of an uprising are also slim because Jon is the Lord of Winterfell instead of Sansa who is a granddaughter of Lord Hoster Tully</p>

<h2>Jon's lack of resources and men</h2>

<p>More importantly, Jon does not have the number or resources. Jon has only 2,000 something men and most of them are wildlings who are untrained in ways of pitched battle against armoured and mounted foes. Jaime has all the power of Casterly Rock and Twins. Do you honestly think he could break the siege? </p>

<p>Arryns came to help Sansa. Jon is nothing to them and they did not come to help him. Sansa is cousin of Lord Arryn (And of course Petyr Baelish sees prospects of advantage in helping her).</p>

<p>If Jon marches south anyways and leaves North undefended once again, who is to say that Ironborn might not descend once again or those who have reasons to resent his rule would not rise up in Rebellion? What happens if the monarch on Iron Throne decides to support those who rise up? </p>

<h2>Claim of Arryns on Riverlands</h2>

<p>Robin Arryn is also a claimant to Riverlands as Lord Hoster Tully was his grandfather too &amp; his claim will be more acceptable for Riverlords than Sansa's because he is a male. Jon won with help of Arryns but while Arryns helped Sansa gain the North, will they help her to relieve Riverrun and win over Riverlords to her side? I don't think so. I would claim Riverrun for my own if I were a grandson of Lord Hoster Tully. </p>

<h2>Edmure's claim? Lol</h2>

<p>Ignore Edmure and his claim, in case of an attack by Arryns and Stark, Edmure would be killed by Freys to ensure their claim to Riverrun. </p>

<p>If as you suggest, had he betrayed Jaime and stayed inside with Blackfish, that would mean end of House Tully. Jaime has enough men to storm the walls and take the castle quickly. He has made it clear he does not care how many men die. The only thing holding his hands is his vow to Catelyn Stark about not raising arms against House Tully or Stark. Blackfish, Edmure and his son are last of the Tullys. Blackfish is an on old man with no kids and nothing to live for. Edmure is a father. He had to make sure that Tullys survived, because if they were wiped in a stupid show of defiance, all hope of regaining Riverrun will be lost. He did not surrender because he was a coward, he surrendered because the fight was hopeless and he was a father.  </p>

<h2>Jaime's Experience</h2>

<p>Jaime has turned into a cautious commander, he now gives attention to posting outriders. He won't be surprised by anyone now like he was surprised by Robb in Whispering woods.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Answers from the show or books are welcome. </p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","132506","<p>First of all we need to understand what was the extent of the said <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Wildfire_plot"">plot</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aerys_II_Targaryen"">Aerys II</a> had placed wildfire caches on all key positions of the city which primarily included the city gates, Red Keep, Great Sept of Baelor and Dragonpit.</p>

<p>No one except chosen members of the Pyromancers, King Aerys &amp; Jaime Lannister knew about it. <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Qarlton_Chelsted"">Lord Chelsted</a> came to suspect the plot and was burnt for trying to dissuade Aerys from using it. </p>

<p>Jaime later killed Aerys, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rossart"">Rosart</a>, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Garigus"">Garigus</a>, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Belis"">Belis</a> and other pyromancers involved in the plot but he never asked them about the locations of the said caches. </p>

<p>From ASOS:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When I came on <strong>Rossart</strong>, he was dressed as a common man-at-arms,
  hurrying to a postern gate. <strong>I slew him first</strong>. <strong>Then I slew
  Aerys</strong>, before he could find someone else to carry his message to the
  pyromancers. <strong>Days later, I hunted down the others and slew them as
  well</strong>. Belis offered me gold, and Garigus wept for mercy. Well, a
  sword’s more merciful than fire, but I don’t think Garigus much
  appreciated the kindness I showed him.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means among the living people, except Jaime and Brienne no one has a clue about this last madness of King Aerys. </p>

<p>Later, Tyrion found out only the cache beneath the dragonpit. That means, the other caches are still soundly in place.</p>

<p>From ACOK:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This cannot be true,” said Tyrion as he pored over the ledgers.
  “<strong>Almost thirteen thousand jars?</strong> Do you take me for a fool? I’m not
  about to pay the king’s gold for empty jars and pots of sewage sealed
  with wax, I warn you.”</p>
  
  <p>“No, no,” Hallyne squeaked, “the sums are accurate, I swear. We have
  been, hmmm, most fortunate, my lord Hand. <strong>Another cache of Lord
  Rossart’s was found, more than three hundred jars. Under the
  Dragonpit!</strong> Some whores have been using the ruins to entertain their
  patrons, and one of them fell through a patch of rotted floor into a
  cellar. When he felt the jars, he mistook them for wine. He was so
  drunk he broke the seal and drank some.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But this quote uses the word <strong>another</strong>. Which means some of the caches were discovered previously, of which we do not know about. Nevertheless, it is safe to assume that most of the caches will be intact.</p>

<p>Other than that, there is also another intriguing thing. How much did Varys know? His little birds must have observed pyromancers coming and going. If that was enough to make a man like Lord Chelsted suspicious, surely Varys must have been so as well. Later, we know Varys knows many of the secrets of the red keep including secret passages. He might have discovered some of those caches beneath the palace himself.</p>

"132652","Why isn't Jon executed on sight?","<p>So, to get spoilers out of the way - </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Jon Snow is too honorable to break his oath and leave the Night's Watch.  However, he is stabbed a bunch, dies, and due to a line in the Night's Watch oath - ""It shall not end until my death"" - is able to leave without his usual reservation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, this is fine from Jon's perspective.  However, there is a fairly rigid law about the Wall's deserters being punished by death. Which makes me wonder: why isn't Jon having more trouble with this? </p>

<p>He knows what happened, but others don't.  And the explanation that he actually <em>did</em> die doesn't seem like one the lands' lords and authorities would take on faith.  I know I wouldn't.  His story isn't quite like Sam's, who was sent by the Night's Watch to become a maester.  Jon is famous enough that many would know who he is, and that he has taken the black.  But a story like him dying and coming back to life is probably one that takes quite a but of time to stick - if it ever does.</p>

<p>A possible explanation might be that people know Jon is honorable and trust him. Or that they don't care about the law, and think that they can somehow benefit from not executing him - although the law seems to be a strict one, and not everyone seems to be psyched to help Jon out.  Or maybe by that time people coming back to life is a common enough thing that people believe it that easily.</p>

<p>Speculation aside, however, I am curious whether this was directly addressed from the higher-ups - the makers of the show, or the big boss himself.  Why isn't Jon executed on sight?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","132667","<h2>Jon's got an Army</h2>

<p>The answer is simple. Because Jon has an Army. No one can arrest or execute him unless they deal with his Army first. </p>

<p>The deserters are usually taken by hunting parties of the Watch or in case the deserter makes it beyond Brandon's new gift, he is taken by patrols of the local lords. They are usually alone or in very small groups so they do not pose much danger to a lord who might be prepared to carry out the sentence. </p>

<p>Jon's different because he is the only crow (ex-crow) come down from the Wall with an Army. He had 2,000 wildlings at his back. The figure is even more impressive when you consider that for <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Second_Battle_of_Winterfell"" rel=""noreferrer"">Second Battle of Winterfell</a>, Warden of the North Ramsay Bolton managed to gather only 6000 men. Granted 6000 can easily cut their way through the meagre 2000 wildlings but that would require a full battle to capture the bastard of Winterfell. So in a way, Jon had about 1/3 power Warden of North could muster and thus it was sufficient to give any lord with that idea a pause. </p>

<p>Even Lord Bolton was forced to reconsider this factor and he had to make this offer to Jon in S06E09:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now, dismount and kneel before me, surrender your army and proclaim me
  the true Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. <strong>I will pardon
  you for deserting the Night's Watch.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do not doubt that had Jon surrendered his Army, he would have been slaughtered but he did not surrender his Army. Thus he could not be taken. Say what you will about Ramsay, but at least he remembered that Jon is a deserter, unlike other lords.</p>

<h2>Lack of Warrants from Castle Black (Books)</h2>

<p>From <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/92776/how-do-southern-people-discern-nights-watch-deserters-from-truthful-brothers-se/131136#131136"">a previous answer</a>, you can see the assertion on how Castle Black sends warrants for deserters (from books POV) and how do Lords distinguish deserters in their lands. In Jon's case, no such warrants were issued. And he made no efforts to hide himself.</p>

<h2>Trust a bastard? Nopes</h2>

<p>As for trust, People of Westeros generally do not consider Bastards to be trust worthy, even if it is Eddard Stark's bastard. We have most of evidence in this regard from the books, not the show. </p>

<h2>Resurrection is normal? No</h2>

<p>Coming back from the dead would be just as shocking as it would be in our world. The only resurrection that we have seen is that of Beric Dondarrion. And he is a fugitive lord-turned-outlaw, currently cut from rest of the world in Riverlands. Sure peasants may have come to believe he can't be killed but since they believe a lot of things, no one is going to believe that. From the Books we know that Beric's resurrection is considered to be failure of the men who claim to kill him i.e. they think that the claimants lied and they had never killed Dondarrion in the first place. Most of the realm probably hasn't heard of a Lord Dondarrion from Dornish marches since beginning of the War of the Five Kings.</p>

<p>So no it is not common in Westeros for a dead man to come back alive (Well at least without blue eyes shining like stars).</p>

<h2>The Sansa effect</h2>

<p>He also has Sansa. If they win (which they did), Sansa becomes Lady of Winterfell and Warden of the North (Even though in the books, it is a title granted &amp; renewed by the Crown, in the show it appears to be a hereditary title). If Sansa confirms the story, Lords and peasants will believe it as well, well at least on the outside even if they harbor doubts. The Night's Watch under Edd Tollett might also confirm the event and make entries into their records. (Besides Edd is not the Lord Commander. He may be acting lord commander for now but what happens if brothers of Night's Watch elect someone else for their Lord Commander at election?)</p>

<h2>The technical debate on termination of Service with NW</h2>

<p>But it must be noted Edd does not agree with Jon's point that death is end of his duty. From S06E04: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Edd: How can you leave us now? </p>
  
  <p>Jon: I did everything I could. You know that. </p>
  
  <p>Edd: <strong>You swore a vow.</strong>  </p>
  
  <p>Jon: Aye, I pledged my life to the Night's Watch. I gave my life. </p>
  
  <p>Edd: <strong>For all nights to come.</strong> </p>
  
  <p>Jon: They killed me, Edd! My own brothers. You want me to stay here
  after that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Vow contains two important parts indicating the end of service:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Night gathers, and now my watch begins. <strong>It shall not end until my
  death</strong>. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I
  shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my
  post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I
  am the shield that guards the realms of men. <strong>I pledge my life and
  honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to
  come</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jon is sticking to the phrase that says that his Watch ended with his death. Edd is more of the idea that his Watch does not end because it is for all the nights to come. The pioneers of Night's Watch did not consider case of a bloke who gets resurrected when they were writing their vows. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, it's Jon's Army which gives the lords of the realm a pause. If he loses his Army, pretty sure everyone will suddenly recall he is a deserter. </p>

<p>Personally I believe this is a serious flaw in writing. Not one house in North objected or asked about Jon's ""desertion"" from the Night's Watch when by rights they should have done so. We can make observations on why he was not executed, but we cannot make observations on for what splendid reason no Northern Lord was remotely interested in calling Jon a deserter and a traitor. </p>

<p>Obviously lighter and stronger armor is something you want too (sharp, probably less so, but you wouldn't need to sharpen the steel for armor..). I do not recall any character so far directly mentioning or owning Valyrian armor, but are there any records of it ever existing (even in Valyria, pre-Doom)?  </p>

<p>If not, are there reasons for it not existing? It seems like a good idea in theory to use a lighter and stronger armor with a lighter, stronger, and sharper weapon.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At the age of fifteen, Jaime participated in the campaign against the
  Kingswood Brotherhood, during which he saved Lord Sumner Crakehall
  from Big Belly Ben and crossed swords with the psychotic Smiling
  Knight. After the brotherhood had been defeated, Jaime was knighted on
  the battlefield by Ser Arthur Dayne, a member of the Kingsguard of
  King Aerys II Targaryen.</p>
  
  <p>Now a knight, Jaime was to return to Casterly Rock. He decided to stop
  in King's Landing on route, to visit his sister, from whom he had been
  separated for years. There, <strong>Cersei informed him that Lord Tywin
  intended to betroth him to Lysa Tully</strong>, and had gone as far as inviting
  Lord Hoster to King's Landing, to discuss the dower. <strong>Cersei suggested
  that Jaime become a member of the Kingsguard instead</strong>, replacing the
  recently deceased Ser Harlan Grandison. Though this would require
  Jaime to give up his claim to Casterly Rock and his position as Lord
  Tywin's heir, <strong>it would allow him to be close to Cersei and free
  himself of the unwanted marriage to Lysa</strong>. After a night of passionate
  sex, he gave his consent to Cersei's plan. While the siblings expected
  Tywin to oppose it, Cersei claimed he could not openly object. She
  promised to do the rest, and a month later, Jaime received news at
  Casterly Rock that he had been chosen for the Kingsguard, and was to
  present himself to the king at Harrenhal during the grand Tourney,
  where he would say his vows and don his cloak. <strong>Jaime's and
  Cersei's plan did not entirely work as expected. Their father, furious
  about the King's decision, pleaded illness and resigned his position
  as Hand of the King. He returned to Casterly Rock, taking Cersei with
  him, which separated the siblings once more.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>King Aerys II Targaryen went along with the plan for reasons of his own:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jaime was raised to the Kingsguard by Lord Commander Ser Gerold
  Hightower in a ceremony during the tourney at Harrenhal in 281 AC,
  making him the youngest knight ever to be raised to the
  order. That night, however, King Aerys II Targaryen soured
  the honor by sending him back to King's Landing to guard Queen Rhaella
  and Prince Viserys, depriving Jaime of the chance to participate in
  Lord Walter Whent's tourney. It was that moment during which Jaime
  realized that <strong>the king had only chosen him for the Kingsguard to
  slight Lord Tywin, of whom Aerys was insanely jealous, and to rob him
  of his heir.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, after his sister married Robert Baratheon their plan did succeed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jaime was part of the honor guard that brought Cersei to King's
  Landing for her wedding to Robert. Cersei and Robert were married in
  284 AC, with Jaime present. He won the tourney held to
  celebrate the wedding. <strong>Jaime and Cersei had sex on the morning of
  Cersei's wedding, and continued their illicit relationship after
  Cersei's wedding.</strong> Cersei refused to join her new husband on his
  hunting trips, as to be able to spend time with Jaime. Jaime
  accompanied Robert and Cersei to Greenstone, when Robert went to visit
  his mother's family. Jaime dubbed the castle ""Greenshit"" when he first
  saw it, and convinced Cersei to do the same. They spent a fortnight
  with the Estermonts. During one of those nights, Jaime followed Robert
  on Cersei's request, to confirm her suspicion that Robert was sleeping
  with his cousin. Jaime and Cersei slept together that night, and
  Cersei likes to believe that their eldest son, Joffrey, was conceived
  that night.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Daenerys burns all the Dothraki Khals and then comes out of the burning house. Then all the Dothraki that came to see what was happening knelt before her, considering her the new leader of the horde because she 'defeated' the other Khals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Why would she be considered a Khaleesi and not a witch? Why did the Dothraki decide to follow her?</strong> It's seems like witches are a bad thing in Westeros, Essos and especially in the Dothraki culture. In the eye of a Dothraki man, I feel like she should be seen as a witch for surviving/creating the fire.
Also, there are probably a lot of Dothraki/Khalasars that probably don't want to be ruled by some foreign girl.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT :</strong> I think the Dothraki in the show does not believe she is a witch because I think Dothraki would not follow a witch. Witches seem to be a very bad thing in the eyes of this culture (see how the Dothraki girls in S06E03 were saying that Daenerys was a witch and that they should kill her, and after the event of the season 1 also). </p>

<p>So, if you think that the Dothraki might think that she's a witch but decide to follow her nonetheless, <strong>why would they agree to follow a witch even though witches are known to be a bad thing in this culture?</strong> </p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","132899","<p><strong>The Dothraki have no other option.</strong> Daenerys has just created a power vacuum where she is the only one to fill the void. </p>

<p>Now, all the other Khals are gone. Daenrys emerges as the one who defeated them. The Dothraki will only follow a winner, a disgraced Khal is no Khal at all. </p>

<p>I think the horde in general will see her more as a god than a witch. She is not performing blood magic or any types of spells. She is immune to fire and can control dragons!</p>

Jeor abdicated Bear Island and went to The Wall so that Jorah could inherit. I'd have to think it'd be difficult visiting a home that your son lost, even if it was just lost to your sister. Jeor doesn't have a legitimate heir with Jorah in disgrace and so his descendants will not inherit Bear Island.</p>

  <p>The timelines between the various storylines don’t necessarily line up within a given episode. For instance, the ‘Northern Tour’ Jon and Sansa embark on would probably take a couple weeks, but Arya’s storyline over the past few episodes only spans a few days. We realized a while ago that if we tied ourselves in knots trying to make all the ‘story days’ line up between all the characters the momentum would suffer.</p>

<p>Varys leaves Mereen in episode 8. He is seen in Dorne in episode 10. So, that's believable. He gathers the support of Dorne and Tyrell ships and goes back in the same episode to Mereen. Varys doesn't have teleportation power because you can see Tyrell and Dorne ships along with Greyjoy and Targaryian ships in the naval fleet of Dany. You can't teleport ships so it is to be assumed that Varys sent a word back to Tyrion telling him that Tyrell and Martels are behind Dany now, so wait up.

The guy at the Citadel was unaware that Jeor Mormont wasn't Lord Commander anymore. The news of Jon Snow becoming Lord Commander seemed to spread to other parts to Westeros I believe probably because of ravens and/or messengers and judging by all the events that happened after Mormont's death many months would have passed, maybe even more than a year. Therefore I find it very hard to believe that that news hadn't reached the Citadel yet. Is there an explanation for this?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","133088","<p>I think the answer comes from the interaction they show and with the fact that Sam telling the person looking at the books that news causes that individual to be very non-plussed because the notification is ""irregular.""

<p>It looks like the citadel has a very specific way of updating their official records, so ""word on the street"" would not be sufficient for them to change their records.  </p>

<p>Maester Aemon mentioning the demise of Lord Mormont in the letters would not be a flaw, necessarily, because he wouldn't have sent one of those letters to the citadel, because they wouldn't have troops/bodies to send to the Watch, and it is the sending of these missives that occupied his time between the new Lord Commander taking over and his untimely demise, as referenced by Sam.

<h2>Baratheon Claim</h2>

<p>King Aegon V Targaryen's daughter Princess Rhaelle married Lord Ormund Baratheon. They had a son named Steffon who is father of Robert, Renly and Stannis. Robert's claim to Iron Throne came due to his descent from King Aegon V. </p>

<p>Cersei has no such claim as she is not descended from Targaryens. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Grand Council to elect a new King</h2>

<p>Legally, in event of ambiguous circumstances in succession and complex case of finding the heir apparent, A Grand Council of all the lords of the realm is called where lords choose the King or heir by popular vote. All claimants can have their say in the council. </p>

<p><strong>Great Council of 101 AC</strong></p>

<p>King Jaehaerys's eldest sons Princes Aemon and Baelon predeceased their father.</p>

<p>Since His Grace's only surviving Son Vaegon was a maester, he could not choose Vaegon as his successor because maesters are forbidden to hold lands and titles by vows. This meant he would have to choose a successor from  his grandchildren; Princess Rhaenys (Only daughter of the eldest child of King Jaehaerys, Prince Aemon), or Prince Viserys, Prince Daemon (Sons of the the King's second son Baelon). Jaehaerys may have wanted to choose Viserys as Daemon was younger than Viserys and Rhaenys was a woman but he knew that explicit royal edict in this regard would result in civil war on his death as Rhaenys' maternal uncle Lord Boremund Baratheon and her husband Lord Corlys Velaryon were two of the strongest Lords in the seven Kingdoms and would never have stood aside meekly for Prince Viserys to take the throne when it belonged to Rhaenys by rights. </p>

<p>So to avoid prospects of another civil war (As Jaehaerys himself took the throne after a civil war with his uncle King Maegor the Cruel) by getting a consensus of Lords of realm, Jaehaerys called a grand council to choose between his son Aemon's daughter Rhaenys<sup>1</sup>, Baelon's son Viserys and Rhaenys' son Laenor Velaryon. </p>

<p>Tensions ran high which proved that Jaehaerys' concerns weren't unfounded. Lord Baratheon and Lord Velaryon actively lobbied in support of Rhaenys' son Laenor. Prince Daemon started gathering soldiers to take the throne forcibly for his elder brother Viserys if council chose Laenor or Rhaenys.</p>

<p>As a result, Rhaenys was passed over because she was a woman and never made her claim , Laenor was passed over because he was a child despite support of Lord Boremund Baratheon and Lord Corlys Velaryon, thus Prince Viserys was chosen as heir of his grandfather King Jaehaerys I.  </p>

<p><strong>Great Council of 233 AC</strong></p>

<p>King Maekar I's eldest son Daeron predeceased his father. Second son Prince Aerion also predeceased King Maekar. Daeron left a young girl and Aerion left a baby boy. </p>

<p>Thus on unexpected death of King Maekar, the King's hand Lord Brynden Blooraven called a great council. Claims of Daeron's daughter<sup>2</sup>, Aerion's son<sup>3</sup> &amp; Aenys Blackfyre<sup>4</sup> were dismissed. Lords of the realm reluctantly elected youngest son of King Maekar, Prince Aegon<sup>5</sup>. </p>

<p>Thus it was Prince Aegon who took the throne as King Aegon V.  </p>

<hr>

<h2>Remaining Baratheons</h2>

<p>In show canon, House Baratheon is now legally extinct because</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Tommen was the last (Apparent) Baratheon after deaths of Stannis
 Baratheon, Shireen Baratheon and Myrcella Baratheon. Renly Baratheon
 had already died.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means only unacknowledged bastard Baratheons are alive e.g. Gendry. There are no more Baratheons. </p>

<p>Also Robert Baratheon's great grandfather, Lord <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lyonel_Baratheon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lyonel Baratheon</a> fathered at least <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Duncan_the_Tall#Later"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">one daughter</a> and son <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Ormund_Baratheon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ormund Baratheon</a>. Ormund Baratheon sired <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Steffon_Baratheon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Steffon Baratheon</a> who is supposedly only child of marriage between Ormund Baratheon and Rhaelle Targaryen. Steffon's line ended with Tommen (who is in fact not part of the line anyway). So we have to go back to that daughter of Lord Lyonel Baratheon. We do not know her name or which house she married in. But in event of a grand council, her descendents would have the best claim as heirs to House Baratheon. </p>

<p>Not to mention, there might be cadet dynasties of House Baratheon/Durrandon such as House <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Bolling"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bolling</a> and House <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Wensington"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wensington</a> who will be claimants as well in case of extinction of House Baratheon. Also, in the books, there is <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Edric_Storm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Edric Storm</a> as well, the only acknowledged bastard of Robert Baratheon. If the Lords of the realm agree to it (Assuming such a situation rises in the books as well), he can be legitimized by a council or simply crowned and left to legitimize himself.  </p>

<hr>

<h2>Jaime's claim</h2>

<p>Jaime is not Lord of the Casterly Rock, <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/128219/who-is-now-the-lord-of-casterly-rock/128221#128221"">Cersei is the lady of the Casterly Rock</a>. <s>Jaime is sworn brother of Kingsguard and thus is disqualified from inheriting any lands</s>. Jaime was dismissed by King Tommen in S06E06 and is thus qualified for inheritence again, as pointed out by <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/31029/bcdotweb"">BCdotWeb</a>. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tommen: When you attack the Faith, you attack the Crown. <strong>Anyone who
  attacks the Crown is unfit to serve as Lord Commander of the
  Kingsguard</strong>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If Jaime is not a KG anymore, that makes him Heir to Casterly Rock, not Lord of Casterly Rock. Jaime was still a KG when Tywin Lannister died, which is why Cersei inherited the Lannister lands. Cersei may however choose to abdicate as Lady of Casterly Rock and give it to Jaime. </p>

<h2>The Only surviving legal direct claimant to the Throne</h2>

<p>Unless a Great council is convened and elects a new candidate, the only legal claimant to Iron Throne of Aegon I is now Daenerys Stormborn. </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Jon Snow has been revealed to be a Targaryen but <s>it is unclear whether
 he is trueborn or a bastard</s>. It has been revealed in Season 7 that Jon is not a bastard but rather trueborn son of Rhaegar and Lyanna (Named Aegon at birth), making him the real heir to the Throne, ahead of his aunt Daenerys in line of succession.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Daenerys has sailed from Meereen to take back her father's throne. From her POV, Robert was a usurper and so were his successors. Many in the Seven Kingdoms would agree with her. So even if a council is convened, Daenerys has the strongest claim being daughter of King Aerys II.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> <s>That is unless Jon turns out to be trueborn son of Rhaegar Targaryen.
 If that happens, Jon will have the strongest claim.</s> Jon is trueborn son of Rhaegar But Daenerys has
 dragons so I suppose it does not matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>What can we speculate?</h2>

<p>This means succession is not clear and a grand council is in order. Cersei however took the throne for her own but that does not mean that other lords would accept her claim meekly. </p>

<p>Most likely this means uprising of the lords who had previously acknowledged authority of King Tommen Baratheon and House Baratheon. Reach and Dorne will be the chief Kingdoms to rise up because they have the means and power to defy Cersei. They have already added their power to Daenerys'.</p>

<p>Seeing how High septon and seat of the faith were destroyed by Cersei, it is unlikely that new High Septon who will be most likely elected in <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Starry_Sept"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Starry Sept, Old Town, Reach</a><sup>6</sup> now (And thus under Tyrell influence), will support or tolerate Cersei. She will be branded a heretic and a criminal against gods. </p>

<p>Both factions of House Greyjoy are already seeking to ally themselves to Daenerys Targaryen. Yara Greyjoy has succeeded in winning Daenerys over to her side so Euron either has to fight alone and die or he can join the Lannisters and form marital alliance with Cersei instead. </p>

<p>Riverlands are in disarray and Northmen are busy in their own succession squabbles and in solidifying the reestablished Stark dominion. </p>

<p>And the greatest threat of all, Daenerys Stormborn, now the only claimant to the throne other than Jon ""Snow"" Targaryen is already on her way to Westeros. She can directly go to Old Town and Starry Sept (Without any fighting as Tyrells are committed to her cause) and have the new High Septon crown and anoint her as Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen, first of her name, Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the first Men just like her ancestor Aegon the Conqueror was crowned there. </p>

<p>This means the war that started after Robert's death is far from over.</p>

<p>""Vengeance, Justice, Fire and Blood"" is coming. </p>

<p><sub><strong>1</strong></sub> <sub>Jaehaerys had actually passed over his grand-daughter Rhaenys in favor of his second son Baelon when her father the Prince of Dragonstone Aemon died. So in GC of 101 AC, Rhaenys wasn't actually a choice nominated by Jaehaerys I for the GC. She was however a claimant and thus reserved the right to make her case in the Grand council. She however, chose not to, and instead supported her son Laenor Velaryon's claim which came from her. She was nicknamed ""Queen who never was"" by smallfolk because technically she should have succeeded her grandfather as Queen of Westeros. </sub></p>

<p><sub><strong>2</strong></sub> <sub> Princess Vaella Targaryen, daughter of Prince Daeron Targaryen, was simple-minded. On account of her mental incapacity and her gender, her claim was dismissed after brief consideration.</sub></p>

<p><sub><strong>3</strong></sub> <sub> Prince Maegor Targaryen, son of Prince Aerion Targaryen, was an infant. Only a few lords supported his claim but most spoke against it because they feared that the infant may have inherited his father's madness. Many also opposed his claim because he was named Maegor, after the cruelest Targaryen King.</sub></p>

<p><sub><strong>4</strong></sub> <sub>Aenys Blackfyre was actually executed by Brynden 'Bloodraven' Rivers before he could make his claim. This was a breach of promises made to Aenys by Lord Bloodraven which guaranteed Aenys' safe passage. Young Prince Aegon Targaryen was especially infuriated by this treachery. So when Council chose Prince Aegon as King Aegon V, his first act was to condemn Bloodraven to death. Later the King relented and offered Bloodraven a chance to take the Black. Bloodraven accepted and went on to become Lord Commander of Night's Watch eventually. He retained that position and last Targaryen ancestral blade <em>Darksister</em> until his disappearance beyond the Wall.</sub>  </p>

<p><sub><strong>5</strong></sub> <sub> Lords first quietly offered the crown to Maester Aemon who had taken vows of a Maester and forsaken his name and claims. Since many lords were against his younger brother Prince Aegon, they decided to overpass Aegon's claim and offer the throne to Aemon instead. High Septon supported those lords and offered to absolve Aemon of all vows if he would agree to take the crown. Aemon however refused to dishonor his vows and took the black when his younger brother Aegon was crowned.</sub></p>

<p><sub><strong>6</strong></sub> <sub> Before King Baelor the Blessed built Great Sept of King's Landing (Later named after the King), Starry Sept used to be seat of the Faith. Aegon the Conqueror was crowned there by High Septon when he defeated allied Armies of Westerlands, The Reach and the North. Since Great Sept of Baelor is now destroyed as per show canon, the Faith council will now probably meet in second most prestigious sept in Westeros, which is Starry Sept, to choose the new High Septon.</sub></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Most certainly, she referred to Khal Drogo. The show clearly portrayed how Daenerys Targaryen became a stuff for sale  and a significant instrument of way to the goals of Viserys. Even after their marriage, it wasn't her decision and desire to be in the same room with the Khal.</p>

<p>Afterwards, Daenerys and Drogo found theirselves falling in love and getting serious affections with each other. Thus, it started the well-known relationship they had until Drogo has reached his death.</p>

<p>When Jon Snow and Daenerys met in Dragonstone to prime an alliance, she said those lines quoted at the first part of this thread's body. Why did Daenerys consider their relationship as raped and defiled? For all I know, she has been affected of how much she loved the Khal. Wouldn't that be deemed as a disrespectful approach to her heart's desires and to her husband?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","198561","<h1>She was referring to Khal Drogo</h1>
<p>Yes, she grew to love him as their relationship progressed but that doesn’t change what he did to her initially. He abused and used her for his purposes initially and that involved rape. Emilia Clarke gives some of her own insight into this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>GLAMOUR:</strong> Another criticism that's been pointed at the show concerns its depictions of rape. Khaleesi—</p>
<p><strong>EC:</strong> —was raped in season one.</p>
<p><strong>GLAMOUR:</strong> By her husband. A lot of people came away from that arc with the unsettling impression that almost immediately after the rape she falls in love with and dedicates herself to her rapist.</p>
<p><strong>EC:</strong> Yes. Well, Daenerys and Khal Drogo's arranged marriage, and the customary rape that followed—ask George R.R. Martin why he did that, 'cause that's on him. But I thought the consensual sex she has thereafter was genius. She is physically saying, &quot;You can't rape me again. I'm going to be in control and show you something you've never seen before.&quot; At the heart of it, we're telling a story; you need that part of the story to feel empathy for Daenerys. You see her attacked by her brother, raped by her husband, and then going, &quot;F--k all of you, I'm gonna rule the world.&quot; That's where we are now.</p>

<p>However, given the context of the quote she is likely also talking about her brother, Viserys. Note how he used her as goods, selling her to Khal Drogo to get his army. We also see that he defiles her, the very first we see of him is acting inappropriately towards her.</p>

<p>The Thirteenth Lord Commander of the Night's Watch proclaimed her his queen after he named himself king. So, while &quot;Night's Queen&quot; is never a title explicitly given it can be easily inferred that the queen of the &quot;Night's King&quot; would be called that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The gathering gloom put Bran in mind of another of Old Nan's stories, the tale of Night's King.

<p>The Maesters have heard and recorded the same story, although they offer some more insight on how the legend may have began.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The oldest of these tales concern the legendary Night's King, the thirteenth Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, who was alleged to have bedded a sorceress pale as a corpse and declared himself a king. For thirteen years the Night's King and his &quot;corpse queen&quot; ruled together, before King of Winter, Brandon the Breaker, (in alliance, it is said, with the King-Beyond-the-Wall, Joramun) brought them down. Thereafter, he obliterated the Night's King's very name from memory.</p>
<p>In the Citadel, the archmaesters largely dismiss these tales—though some allow that there <strong>may have been a Lord Commander who attempted to carve out a kingdom for himself</strong> in the earliest days of the Watch. Some suggest that perhaps <strong>the corpse queen was a woman of the Barrowlands</strong>, a daughter of the Barrow King who was then a power in his own right, and oft associated with graves.</p>

","<game-of-thrones>","133060","<p>The Maester's chain, forged of different metals, is a <strong>symbol of <em>service</em> and an indicator of the <em>wide learning</em> the particular Maester has achieved</strong>.  It is a symbolic ornament with multiple layers of meaning.</p>

<p>Jon Snow describes his conversation with Maester Luwin:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""He told me that a maester's collar is made of chain to remind him
  that he is sworn to serve,"" John said, remembering.  ""I asked why each
  link was a different metal.  A silver chain would look much finer with
  his grey robes, I said.  Maester Luwin laughed.  A maester forges his
  chain with study, he told me.  The different metals are each a
  different kind of learning, gold for the study of money and accounts,
  silver for healing, iron for warcraft.  And he said there were other
  meanings as well.  The collar is supposed to remind a maester of the
  realm he serves, isn't that so?  Lords are gold and knights steel, but
  two links can't make a chain.  You also need silver and iron and lead,
  tin and copper and bronze and all the rest, and those are farmers and
  smiths and merchants and the like.  A chain needs all sorts of metals,
  and a land needs all sorts of people.""</p>

<p>Quote is from Chapter 41 of <em>A Game of Thrones</em>, where Jon Snow tries to convince Maester Aemon to take Samwell Tarly under his tutelage.</p>

<p>As for the books shown in the Season 6 finale, there's no equivalent in the (Song of Ice and Fire) books that I recall, and certainly no exposition on (chains on books).  However, where the chain is a symbol to the Maesters, it's quite reasonable for them to extend it to their libraries - just as the Cross is a Christian symbol that shows up on a wide variety of places - rosaries, steeples, Bible covers, bookmark tassels, chalices, communion wafers, sword hilts, stoles, tattoos, and bumper stickers.</p>

<p>It may also be that the chains are meant to index books - books having to do with finance would feature gold in their chains; books having to do with healing would feature silver; books on warcraft would feature iron.  Allowing the Maesters to... ahem... judge a book by its chain.</p>

<p>Is that right?</p>

"133152","Why would Tywin allow Jaime Lannister to fight in dangerous battles","<h2>Why would Tywin risk losing his most important son in battles that could have killed Jaime Lanister at a young age?</h2>

<p>While researching this question, I came across this question and answer.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/123550/why-did-tywin-lannister-allow-jaime-to-join-the-kingsguard"">Why did Tywin Lannister allow Jaime to join the Kingsguard?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There is an excerpt in one of the answers from <em>The World of Ice and Fire: The Untold History of Westeros, p121</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ser Jaime was also Lord Tywin's heir, however, and carried all his
  hopes for the perpetuation of House Lannister, as his lordship's other
  son was a the malformed dwarf, Tyrion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although it states why Tywin had to allow Jaime into the Kings Guard, it does not state why he would risk his son's life in battle.</p>

<p>At the age of fifteen, Jaime fought in the battle against the Kingswood Brotherhood, after which Jaime was knighted on the battlefield by Ser Arthur Dayne.</p>

<p>It just goes against all logical thinking to allow a green, young boy to fight in a dangerous battle when he is so important to probably <strong>the</strong> most prestigious family in Westeros. </p>

<p>Or is there some significance in being in a battle, like having to fight in one before you can be given knighthood? Or is there another reason as to why Tywin would allow this?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","133154","<p>The answer is in Chapter 44 of AFFC, not the show sadly.</p>

<h2>Tywin's Wishes</h2>

<p>Jaime saw his mother in a vision and this is what she said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Tywin dreamed that his son would be a great knight</strong>, that his daughter would be a queen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was Tywin's heart's desire that Jaime become a great Knight. No one ever became a great knight without fighting in battles. </p>

<h2>Jaime's skills</h2>

<p>Jaime showed very high aptitude in martial arts since his childhood and thus his father never worried about his skills in defending himself. He however provided him with masters at arms and armours which would probably be very expensive and of high quality. We do know of Jaime's golden armor which people think is gold but is actually gilded steel. </p>

<h2>Highborn Customs for Upbringing of Children</h2>

<p>All highborn lads are supposed to be squires and win their spurs of knighthood.</p>

<p>According to AWOIAF wiki:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When a boy reaches adolescence, he graduates to being a squire.
  Squires learn how to properly care for and use weapons, armor, and
  horses as well as learning about chivalry. In time of war Squires join
  their masters in war, assisting them with their equipment and fighting
  by their side in battles.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Is Battle Veterancy required for Knighthood?</h2>

<p>Not really. If you are following the usual path (page->squire->knight) It depends on the Knight squiring you to determine when you are ready get your spurs aka Knighthood. </p>

<p>Other than that you can either buy your knighthood e.g. Ser Glendon Flowers or you can win it by performing a great deed of a non-military nature e.g. Ser Davos Seaworth winning it by supplying the Starving garrison of Storm's End with food. You can also be knighted for valor in Battle even if you were never a squire e.g. Ser Jorah Mormont winning his knighthood in Siege of Pyke. To learn more about the knighthood paths, see <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/60345/who-can-knight-you-so-that-the-knighting-would-stick/131327#131327"">my previous answer here</a>. </p>

<h2>Is it wise to let a green young boy in War?</h2>

<p>By Westerosi and medieval standards, Jaime was 15 which is almost <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Customs#Age_of_majority"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the age of a grown man</a>. Jaime was green but how do you propose he would have gained experience if not by fighting? Every warrior is green at some point and through battle he gains experience. </p>

<p>Tywin's own father was a weak man of non-martial nature which is why Tywin wanted his heir to be a puissant warrior, so that he could secure Tywin's legacy even after Tywin was dead. That's where we see Kingswood Campaign, a small campaign against a glorified band of bandits. Can't see really a lot of dangers when Royal Army marches against outlaws. </p>

<h2>The Kingswood Campaign</h2>

<p>Jaime followed the regular route and became squire and ward of Lord <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Sumner_Crakehall"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sumner Crakehall</a> as per Westerosi customs. Squires attend to their masters in battle so Jaime did as well in Fight against the Kingswood brothehood. Jaime was not supposed to do what he did but as fate would have it, Lord Crakehall was injured and Jaime took it upon himself to protect his ""father figure"". </p>

<p>That's when people realized the true potential of this young squire as he held his own against the infamous <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Big_Belly_Ben"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Big Belly Benn</a> and <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Smiling_Knight"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Smiling Knight</a>. His performance was so impressive that a legendary Knight of Kingsguard, Ser Arthur Dayne promptly knighted Jaime at end of the campaign. Jaime won his knighthood in that campaign by none other than Ser Arthur Dayne.</p>

<p>Besides you are over-estimating the danger of the campaign. Kingswood brotherhood were essentially a band of outlaws. They were not a dangerous Army, they relied on guerrilla tactics and support among the masses to hide after their raids. It was a perfect testing ground for a young squire aspiring to be a Knight. Besides, Jaime would have an Army around him. </p>

<h2>Outlaws, Ransoms &amp; Nobles</h2>

<p>Kingswood Brotherhood was notorious for kidnapping nobles and demanding ransom. Nobles and Knights are usually held captives for ransom if they are bested in battle. Even if Jaime was defeated, he would have been taken captive as Heir to Casterly Rock was worth a lot of ransom. </p>

<h2>Tywin's mindset</h2>

<p>Tywin always thinks more about his ideals and wishes about his family than his actual family. He was more concerned with making his son a great Knight. Such ambitions don't always pay off, Mace Tyrell wanted the same for his son and heir Willas but poor Willas was paralyzed after losing a jousting event against Prince Oberyn Martell. (In show there is no Willas Tyrell).</p>

<p>Jaime did not take any more risks than any other noble highborn lad serving some Knight as a squire. Those dangers are part of being a Knight and a Lord. Which is essentially what those young boys are being trained for. Seeing the mess weak Tytos Lannister had created, Tywin was determined to make his heir strong and capable.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Tywin wanted his son to be a great knight and thus did whatever was necessary to hone his martial skills. </p>

"133161","Is there any tangible proof of Jon Snow's lineage?","<p>Spoilers Alert!!!</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Bran sees that Jon is the son of Lyanna at Tower of Joy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, People of the north won't just believe words.</p>

<p>Howland Reed was with Eddard at the tower, Eddard is dead, but Howland could be alive. Even if Howland Reed comes forth and tells Jon's true lineage. It will still be just words. </p>

<p>Why would the people believe the words of a child and an old man?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","133164","<p><a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Howland_Reed"" rel=""noreferrer"">Howland Reed</a> is alive. He is the last survivor of the Tower of Joy and knows what transpired there. He has kept this a secret due to his loyalty and friendship with Eddard Stark. </p>

<p>But as you correctly note, cynical lords won't believe word of one man. Outside North it would be even more complicated because Reed is a Crannogman who are not viewed favorably in the South. </p>

<p>Besides, If Jon is a Targaryen and son of Prince of Dragonstone, Rhaegar Targaryen, that's a concern for whole realm, not just the North. </p>

<p>By law, (If Lyanna and Rhaegar married, <s>which we do not know they did</s>, see update below.), a grandson (Jon) by eldest son (Rhaegar) comes before a daughter (Daenerys) in succession for a King (Aerys II). If Jon is not a bastard, he is infact the rightful King of Westeros as heir of the mad King, not just North. </p>

<p>Even though there is no Polygamy in faith of the seven, Aegon the Conqueror and Maegor the Cruel practiced it. Quoting <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/2997"" rel=""noreferrer"">GRRM</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[<strong>Questions concerning Targaryen polygamy.</strong>]</p>
  
  <p>Maegor the Cruel has multiple wives, from lines outside his own, so
  there was and is precedent. However, the extent to which the Targaryen
  kings could defy convention, the Faith, and the opinions of the other
  lords decreased markedly after they no longer had dragons. If you have
  a dragon, you can have as many wives as you want, and people are less
  likely to object.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Rhaegar could be married to both Elia and Lyanna simultaneously. </p>

<p>There is no tangible proof for Jon's parentage because only these people were present at the tower or knew about it or possibly knew about it:</p>

<ol>
<li>Eddard Stark (Dead)</li>
<li>Howland Reed (Alive)</li>
<li>Lyanna Stark (Dead)</li>
<li>Arthur Dayne (Dead)</li>
<li>Gerold Hightower (Dead)</li>
<li>4 unnamed Northmen (Dead)</li>
<li>2 unnamed Dornish girls (Fate unknown)</li>
<li>Oswell Whent (Dead)</li>
<li>Rhaegar Targaryen (Died at Trident before Tower of Joy Showdown)</li>
<li>Elia Martell (Died at KL before ToJ showdown, She may not have known anything)</li>
</ol>

<p>(One can argue that two other members of KG namely Prince Lewyn Martell and Ser Jonothor Darry may have known as well but it appears Prince Rhaegar did not confide in all the KG. Ser Barristan Selmy and Ser Jaime Lannister did not know about it despite being members of KG. In any case, Both Lewyn and Jonothor died as well)</p>

<p>Another thing, unrelated to the show but relevant to the books, is <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/6494"" rel=""noreferrer"">George has stated</a> that Meera and Jojen Reed might know something about what transpired in the Tower of Joy.</p>

<p>Anyways, Since all other witnesses are dead, Even if the two girls are alive and add their voice to Reed's, that still won't be enough proof. Besides, Jon does not look like your typical Targaryen but that is the case with many of the half-Targaryens over the history e.g. Prince Baelor Breakspear, Prince Valar, Prince Daeron the drunken, Aegor Rivers etc. </p>

<p>Eddard had fabricated the story of fathering Jon on a common woman named Wylla. If she can be found, investigating her would also prove Jon is not son of Eddard Stark but her whereabouts and status is unknown in Show, while in Books she was a serving woman in Castle of Lord Dayne. </p>

<p>To prove his Targaryen blood, Jon will have to do something which only a Targaryen can do. That is, Riding a dragon. As it happens, Daenerys is on her way to Westeros with her Dragons. Drogon is claimed by Daenerys but Viserion and Rhaegel are up for the taking. If Jon manages to claim one of them, no one will be able to doubt his Dragon blood. </p>

<p>There is also the the possibility of Bran adding his voice to Reed's. The whole issue will come up only if Bran does that. Otherwise, Jon is now the White wolf for the realm, not the white Dragon. Bran is not just a boy, If he returns to inform the realm about this, he is the eldest surviving son of Lord Eddard Stark, <s>thus rightful King in the North. Lords have given their allegiance to a bastard instead of a trueborn Stark female, but will they keep Jon as King when their trueborn male Stark liege lord returns? Would Jon want to keep the seat which is rightfully Bran's? I don't believe so. </s> Apparently, as of Season 7, Bran doesn't want to take his rightful place and Jon remains King in the North.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> No there is no other proof of Jon's parentage except Reed's word. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> As of Season 7 Episode 5, <a href=""https://movies.stackexchange.com/a/78824/52541"">it has been confirmed</a> that Rhaegar's marriage to Elia was anulled and he married another which can be no one other than Lyanna. That makes Jon a legitimate Targaryen and therefore the rightful owner of the Iron Throne of Aegon the Conqueror. The records of the High Septon can be produced as evidence for Lyanna's marriage to Rhaegar but that still won't prove Jon is their child. </p>

As predicted, Euron has visited KL with a marital alliance proposal with Cersei in S07E01.</p>

               <strong>Westerlands</strong></p>
<p>Currently held by Queen Cersei. This is power hub of House Lannister and they ruled as Kings here for centuries until Targaryens came. Cersei inherited it after her father died because Tyrion was an attainted traitor and Jaime was a Kingsguard. Jaime can destabilize that if he wants because he has command and respect of the Lannister Armies. He is the true heir of Tywin Lannister and if he wants, he can claim the Westerland for himself now that he is no longer a Kingsguard. It is however unclear how he took Cersei's coronation and how he feels about her causing his last son to kill himself. In any case, Jaime is the key to Westerlands.</p>

Tommen was a Baratheon (well at least in name) but Cersei is nothing to them. Cersei on the other hand will claim it as inheritance from her son. Stormlander lords will most likely reject such attempts and join Daenerys instead since Daenerys is the closest legitimate kin of Baratheons. (Daenerys and Robert shared the same great grand father, King Aegon V Targaryen). These lords are fiercely loyal to House Baratheon and have no cause to love the Lannisters against whom they rose up under Renly and Stannis Baratheon.</p>

               <strong>Crownlands</strong></p>
<p>Traditionally a royal fief and ruled by Targaryens for three centuries until Robert took over. While Cersei would try to claim them as Queen, it is unclear how the traditionally Targaryen vassals of the Crownlands will react when Daenerys lands with three dragons. They will most likely go over to her because they have no cause to love Cersei or Lannisters. It must be noted however that unlike other regions, Crownlands lack a central non-royal figure they can look to lead them as King himself is the Lord Paramount of this region.  So they would lack unity and cohesive plan which would be required to change their allegiance as a group. Nevertheless, the possibility of sporadic and individual cloak-trading can't be dismissed.</p>

<p>You may be thinking you failed to catch that line, but the producers made sure it is not audible after ""his name is..."". But ""If Robert finds out, he'll kill him."" points out to the child being a Targeryen. The face of the baby fading into adult Jon makes us believe he is Jon.</p>
"
"133181","How do we know this character's lineage, based on the show?","<p>Watching the season 6 finale of Game of Thrones and then reading several blogs online, I've seen many reference a character's lineage as hard fact now that it's been revealed in the show - however, I'm not sure that I picked up on all of the details, because I only see that they've revealed one parent.</p>

<p>My brief summary, please correct me if I'm wrong:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> We see the ""end"" of Bran's vision, where he has gone into the past to witness the ""origin story"" of Jon Snow. Previously, we had thought that Jon was the son of Eddard Stark and an unknown woman, therefore making him a bastard, but a descendant of the Starks nonetheless. Instead, we now see Lyanna stark, Ned's sister, making Ned promise to take care of her son, which tells us that Jon is not Ned's son, he is Lyanna's.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But here's the part that I don't get. I've read several blogs that claim the</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>L+R=J theory (Lyanna Stark + Rhaegar Targaryen are the parents of Jon Snow)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is now completely validated fact. However, I only see half of that - </p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> How do we know who Jon's father is? We only see his mother, having just given birth to him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Granted, we know several things about the past which makes it a strong contender for being true, including</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> the fact that Lyanna had been kidnapped by the Targaryens, making Rhaegar a likely father. But technically, couldn't anyone be the father? Did I miss a scene or a detail which pointed categorically to Rhaegar being Jon's father?</p>
</blockquote>
","<game-of-thrones>","133182","<p><strong>Just based on the show, Lyanna says ""If Robert find out, he'll kill him. You know he will.""</strong> </p>

<p>This proves that he is a threat to Robert. Since they were at the end of the rebellion, we know he might be someone with a claim on the throne, i.e., a Targaryen. The show only mentions Aemon, Viserys, Rhaegar, Daenerys and the Mad King as Targaryen. Among them, only Rhaegar can be the father of Jon.</p>

<p>Moreover, at the beginning of the series, Robert mentions of Rhaegar kidnapping Lyanna. I think it is pretty obvious that Jon is the son of Rhaegar, even in the show.</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Jon Snow is not the bastard son of Ned Stark, but is in fact Ned's nephew, by way of his sister Lyanna.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Okay, to be fair, we don't 100% definitely know this, but it is incredibly heavily implied.  So for the purposes of this question, I assume it to be true.)</p>

<p>If that is the case, then why did Ned lie to his wife?  Why did</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Ned tell Catelyn that he had been unfaithful to her during the campaign, and that this child he brought back was the result of his infidelity?</p>

  <p> raise the baby and keep him safe from Robert's wrath, which presumably includes keeping his true parentage a secret <strong>from Robert</strong>,</p>

<p>what was to be gained from keeping that secret from his wife as well?</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> It seems that lying to his wife about the baby's parentage did nothing to protect Jon - and in fact, made Catelyn less likely to want to protect him - not to mention the damage it caused in their marriage.</p>

Just a precautionary thing.</strong> </p>

<p>To understand this, you must first understand how Eddard Stark and Catelyn Tully got married. Since show did not cover those events, we need to rely on books instead.</p>

<h2>Catelyn's betrothal to Brandon &amp; Eddard's interest in Ashara Dayne</h2>

<p>Catelyn Tully was initially betrothed to Eddard's elder brother Brandon who was heir to Winterfell (ADWD, Chapter 41, ACOK Chapter 45). Eddard himself was infatuated with Lady Ashara Dayne, sister of the legendary Ser Arthur Dayne (ASOS, Chapter 34). Ashara was considered a great beauty of her time. A very splendid depiction by Elena Maria Vacas can be seen on her page, <a href=""https://www.artstation.com/artwork/9B4ZQ"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Brandon's Death and Robert's Rebellion</h2>

<p>Fast forward, Rhaegar and Lyanna run away together when the Starks were on their way to Riverrun for wedding of Brandon and Catelyn. Brandon, hot headed and impulsive, was under the impression that Rhaegar abducted Lyanna. He rode to King's Landing with close friends and screamed for Prince Rhaegar to ""<strong><em>Come out and die</em></strong>"". Prince Rhaegar was not there, but mad King Aerys was. He imprisoned Brandon and summoned his father Lord Rickard Stark to King's Landing. Then he had both of them executed. Then he asked Lord Arryn to send him heads of his wards the young Lords Robert Baratheon and Eddard Stark. Jon Arryn instead called his banners because he loved those boys like his own sons and Robert's rebellion started. (AGOT Chapter 4, ACOK Chapter 55, AGOT chapter 2)</p>

<h2>Eddard marries Catelyn</h2>

<p>Always dutiful and responsible, Eddard set aside his own wishes for marriage and married a total stranger Catelyn Tully in place of his brother, to secure swords of House Tully for Robert's cause (AGOT, Chapter 6). He did not know her, he did not love her and he did not trust her. He did not even like her at the time, it was Ashara whom he liked. </p>

<p>He could not have married Ashara instead because:</p>

<ol>
<li>House Dayne was a minor House with less power as compared to House Tully. Rebels faced combined might of The Reach, Dorne and Crownlands. There was no telling which side Lannisters would go but seeing as Tywin was a childhood friend of Aerys II, He may have joined on side of Aerys too. So They sorely needed swords of the Lord Paramount of Riverlands to wage the war. Daynes used to be kings once, but those days were far gone.  </li>
<li>House Dayne was vassal of House Martell, who had already declared for King Aerys due to marriage between Princess Elia of Dorne and Prince Rhaegar Targaryen. Thus they were honor bound to follow their liege lord Prince Doran in the war, making them unable to help the rebels.</li>
<li>Help from House Dayne would have been very little, if any. Had they joined forces with Rebels, they would be trapped between the loyalist forces of Tyrells and Martells who would at once move to fight the Daynes. That itself would put Ashara and her kin in great danger. Lord Dayne would have to be an utter idiot to agree to such an alliance.</li>
</ol>

<p>After wedding and bedding Catelyn, Eddard went to war.</p>

<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_the_Bells"" rel=""noreferrer"">Battle of Bells</a> happened where combined Forces of Eddard and his father in law saved the trapped Robert Baratheon. </p>

<p>Prince Rhaegar returned from South and died at <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_the_Trident"" rel=""noreferrer"">Trident</a>. </p>

<p>Since Robert was wounded in the battle, Eddard lead a quick charge towards King's Landing, only to find it had been <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Sack_of_King%27s_Landing"" rel=""noreferrer"">conquered for Robert by the Lannisters</a>. Eddard and Robert had a quarrel regarding the murders of Rhaegar's children but Robert only called them Dragonspawn. A fuming Eddard lead his men further south to fight rest of battles alone. He ended <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Siege_of_Storm%27s_End"" rel=""noreferrer"">Siege of Storm's End</a> first and then moved further south to Dorne where entire episode of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Raid_on_the_Tower_of_Joy"" rel=""noreferrer"">Tower of Joy</a> happened. </p>

<h2>Eddard's return from ToJ</h2>

<p>When Eddard got back with Jon, he knew he could not trust anyone especially after he saw Robert's reaction to murder of Rhaegar's children(AGOT, Chapter 12). He knew Robert would kill Jon as well if he so much got a whiff of who he was. So he decided to keep it a secret. His friend Lord Howland Reed did the same.</p>

<p>When Eddard got home, his lady wife arrived soon after, the woman he barely knew and thus did not trust enough to divulge such an important secret which would mean death of his sister's only son if the wrong people learned of it. Therefore, Eddard told her before returning to Winterfell that the babe was his bastard child. A lot of men fathered bastard children and such matters are private so no one was likely to pry into it especially when it's bastard of a man like Eddard who was known to be very private, shy and quiet.</p>

<h2>Danger of being spied on</h2>

<p>With time, Eddard came to love and trust Catelyn but he never divulged that info to her. He probably thought it best to let it be instead of bringing it up again. You never know who is listening in the castles especially with Varys in service of Robert. We know it was wise because Varys had spies in Winterfell and he learnt about the assassination attempt on Bran by Joff's catspaw despite Catelyn trying to keep it a secret. </p>

<h2>Catelyn's attempts to learn the truth</h2>

<p>Catelyn tried to get the information but Eddard was adamant. There were rumors that Ashara Dayne was the mother of the child so Catelyn decided to confront Eddard. Eddard got very stern with her and told her ""<strong><em>Jon is my blood, that's all you need to know</em></strong>"". Catelyn got scared of Ned for first and last time in their married life. After that Catelyn never brought up the topic again and Eddard did not either. (AGOT chapter 6)</p>

<h2>Ashara Dayne Factor</h2>

<p>It is also worth noting that after killing Arthur Dayne at Tower of Joy, Eddard went to Castle of Starfall first, seat of house Dayne. There he gave the ancestral Sword of House Dayne, named Dawn and carried by Ser Arthur Dayne at ToJ, to his(Eddard's, not Arthur's) apparent lover Ashara Dayne and gave her the news of her Brother's death. Mad with grief for her brother (and allegedly losing a child) and the fact that It was Eddard who killed Arthur, Ashara jumped from a tower into the sea and died. So it would make sense that Ned would do anything to avoid mention of Ashara Dayne as it brought back memories that he did not wish to recall ever again. </p>

<p>Ashara was a known alleged lover of Eddard<sup><strong>1</strong></sup> who was also pregnant and gave birth to a child<sup><strong>2</strong></sup> before her death, rumors started that Ashara Dayne was mother of Jon and she killed herself when Eddard took Jon away from her. Eddard did not deny or confirm these rumors but moved to quell them, especially in his own household. Eddard's weird reaction made many people believe that Ashara was Jon's mother. Apparently Eddard thought it best to give people the impression that Ashara must have been the mother. </p>

<p>Ashara's nephew Lord Edric Dayne met Arya and confirmed that Ashara was not the mother of Jon but he also confirmed that She and Eddard loved each other. (ASOS Chapter 39). Exact quote added because I loved that conversation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“My father was Ser Arthur’s elder brother. Lady Ashara was my aunt. I
  never knew her, though. She threw herself into the sea from atop the
  Palestone Sword before I was born.”</p>
  
  <p>“Why would she do that?” said Arya, startled.</p>
  
  <p>Ned looked wary. Maybe he was afraid that she was going to throw
  something at him. “Your lord father never spoke of her?” he said. “The
  Lady Ashara Dayne, of Starfall?”</p>
  
  <p>“No. Did he know her?”</p>
  
  <p>“Before Robert was king. She met your father and his brothers at
  Harrenhal, during the year of the false spring.”</p>
  
  <p>“Oh.” Arya did not know what else to say. “Why did she jump in the
  sea, though?”</p>
  
  <p>“Her heart was broken.”</p>
  
  <p>Sansa would have sighed and shed a tear for true love, but Arya just
  thought it was stupid. She couldn’t say that to Ned, though, not about
  his own aunt. “Did someone break it?”</p>
  
  <p>He hesitated. “Perhaps it’s not my place...”</p>
  
  <p>“Tell me.”</p>
  
  <p>He looked at her uncomfortably. “My aunt Allyria says <strong>Lady Ashara
  and your father fell in love at Harrenhal</strong> -”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Catelyn's resentment</h2>

<p>Catelyn was not a bad woman but it is too much to ask of a woman to endure a walking, talking reminder of her husband's infidelity, especially if you know that it wasn't a mere one night fling, the other woman was loved very much by your husband. She knew about Ashara Dayne, even though not for certainty,  whom she saw as a ghost who was her rival for Eddard's love. She hated that Ashara's alleged son looked more Stark than her own Son Robb who looked like a Tully. She hated that Eddard loved Jon's mother so much that he would not abandon her son despite Cat's constant pleadings. </p>

<p>Thus she treated Jon with contempt and hatred as any medieval step mother would. As suggested by <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/20490/gowenfawr"">Gowenfawr</a>, if Ned had told Catelyn, she would have been kind to Jon and everyone would have wondered what was actually at play there even if Varys did not manage to report the conversation in the first place.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Eddard took his vows very seriously and he promised his sister to keep Jon safe. He endured Jeering, mocking and confrontations with his wife but he never put Jon's security at risk by telling his true identity to anyone. Some things are better left buried. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I was doing a re-read of AGOT today and found something which I had never thought of much importance until now. In AGOT Chapter 33 Eddard VIII, Eddard thinks this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lord Stannis shared the secret Jon Arryn had died for, he was certain
  of it. The truth he sought might very well be waiting for him on the
  ancient island fortress of House Targaryen. <strong><em>And when you have it,
  what then? Some secrets are safer kept hidden. Some secrets are too
  dangerous to share, even with those you love and trust.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It appears this is hinting towards why Eddard kept Catelyn in dark about Jon's parentage even after he came to love and trust her. This is why I love ASOIAF, on every re-read, you discover something new. </p>

<hr>

<p><sub><strong>1</strong></sub> <sub>There is an alternate theory propelled by Barristan Selmy's memoirs of Harrenhal that it is possible that It was Brandon Stark, elder brother of Eddard, who ""dishonored"" Ashara Dayne and had the Harrenhal fling with her. It is, in any case, unproven as of now because Selmy uses the word <em>Stark</em> instead of recalling Ashara's lover by his name. Brandon Stark was however that sort of person, a playboy aristocrat. He had an alleged affair with Barbary Dustin as well despite his betrothal so it won't be beyond him to trick Ashara into sleeping with him by lying to her about his intents/feelings and then abandoning her. It is very uncharacteristic of Eddard Stark to ""dishonor"" a woman and then abandon her. As Robb does most things like Eddard Stark would do, we know he chose to risk his Kingdom and crown instead of ""dishonoring"" Jeyne Westerling, it may be an indication but as stated already, this is a theory. Canon sources still suggest that It was Eddard, not Brandon.</sub> </p>

<p><sub><strong>2.</strong> According to Barristan Selmy, Ashara's Child was a daughter who was dead at birth</sub></p>

"133278","Would this character still be a bastard?","<p>In the last episode of season 6 we see what is clearly..</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p>The truth about Jon's parentage, being the son of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen. </p>

<p>Without getting into the ""why"" and ""if"" about this, (It is already covered in many other questions on this site)</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Would Jon Snow still be a bastard if people knew who his parents are?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just to be clear, i am not asking if he has a claim to the Iron Throne or not.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><laws>","133279","<p>People knowing who Jon's parents are does not mean anything for his bastard status. One is born a bastard if he is born out of wedlock, regardless to who the parents were. </p>

<p>Him being son of Lyanna and Rhaegar does not prove that they had married as well because Rhaegar was already married to Elia Martell and traditionally Westeros is a strictly monogamous region by faith and culture. Being a bastard of a Prince does not mean that someone becomes legitimate child. There are plenty of examples of Bastards sired by Targaryen Princes and Monarchs e.g. Daemon Blackfyre, Aegor Bittersteel, Brynden Bloodraven etc. </p>

<p>It is however entirely possible that Rhaegar may have married Lyanna following the precedent of Aegon the Conqeuror who had two wives. King Maegor also had multiple wives. Quoting <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/2997"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GRRM</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[<strong>Questions concerning Targaryen polygamy.</strong>]</p>
  
  <p>Maegor the Cruel has multiple wives, from lines outside his own, so
  there was and is precedent. However, the extent to which the Targaryen
  kings could defy convention, the Faith, and the opinions of the other
  lords decreased markedly after they no longer had dragons. If you have
  a dragon, you can have as many wives as you want, and people are less
  likely to object.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simple answer is, from Season Finale, we do not know if they had married or not. Thus we cannot say if Jon would remain a bastard or not. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> In Season 7, it is revealed that Rhaegar had his marriage to Elia annulled and married someone else. That someone else can only be Lyanna, making Jon a legitimate Child. So it is all but confirmed in the show that Jon is now a trueborn Targaryen.</p>

<p>From S07E05:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gilly: What does ""annulment"" mean? </p>
  
  <p>Sam: It's when a man sets aside his lawful wife.</p>
  
  <p>Gilly: Maynard says here that <strong>he issued an annulment for a Prince ""Ragger""

<p>She wasn't allowed to use faces from the hall of faces. Is there any evidence she stole the face or killed somebody? If so, do we know the person the face belonged to?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","133288","<p>This event never happened in the books so your books tag is meaningless in this regard. As for the show, As of now, we do not know where did she get that face. Right now it would be just speculation. </p>

<ol>
<li>She killed some woman and took her face</li>
<li>She stole it from House of Black and White</li>
<li>As suggested by <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/48639/kl78"">Kl78</a>, She may have found a corpse and carved its face off. She may not have killed her after all.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Did she kill some person?</h2>

<p>It is a possibility but it is also unlikely. Arya has only killed people who were either on her hit-list or were trying to kill her. She refused to kill lady Crane even though she knew that would mean she failed her tests. Therefore it is unlikely she killed some innocent person. </p>

<h2>Did she steal it?</h2>

<p>This one is more likely than the other. Arya killed the Waif and put her face in the House of Black and white. Jaqen only entered after Arya had finished putting the face on the wall therefore we do not know if she actually did what I believe she did. </p>

<h2>Did she find it?</h2>

<p>It is plausible but less likely. The odds of finding corpse of a good looking young woman just lying out there on the road are very slim. She needed face of a such a woman to find entrance into the castle in disguise of a serving woman.</p>

<p>Lord Walder Frey did not recognize her so that might mean she must have been let in that day only due to her looks and because help would be needed in kitchens to feed the Lannister guests. (Although Lord Walder’s advanced age must be taken into account here, especially how he can’t tell his grandchildren apart sometimes or mothers of his children).</p>

<p>Good looking people get away with things average and bad looking people don’t usually do. Finding entry into a heavily guarded castle hosting very important people is one of those things. </p>

<p>Which leaves Lyanna the Mormont in Bear Island as Alysane is on the march with Stannis. She was on Bear Island because she was not with her Mother in Riverlands, and because she replied to Stannis' summons in ADWD:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is
  STARK.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But since she is the youngest daughter and second daughter of Lady Maege is alive and free, it appears she is filling the place of Alysane in books, rather than being in charge in her own right. </p>

<p>You must keep it in mind that when Lyanna replied Stannis, it was before He moved against Ironborn. Only explanation for that can be that Alysane must be away. </p>

<p>Afterwards when Stannis moved against the Ironborn, It was Alysane who lead the surprise Mormont attack on Ironborn and later swore fealty to Stannis on behalf of her house.</p>

<p>In any case, Alysane is the heir, not Lyanna.</p>

<h2>Show</h2>

<p>In the show, No other Children of Lady Maege Mormont are mentioned and Lyanna is mentioned as Lady of Bear Island. So it appears, in show canon, Lyanna is the only Child of Lady Maege and thus inherited the Island on her Mother's demise. </p>

<p>Maege's death is not shown on the Show but it is implied because in Season 5, Stannis refers to Lyanna as Lady of Bear Island. </p>

<p>As pointed out by <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/31029/bcdotweb"">BCdotWEB</a>, Lyanna said this in Episode ""Broken Man"" to confirm her mother's death:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""My mother wasn't a great beauty or any other kind of beauty. She was
  a great warrior, though. She died fighting for your brother, Robb.""</p>

"133361","Real-World Language Analogues in the World of Ice and Fire","<p>George RR Martin is, by his own admission, <a href=""http://www.welovethisbook.com/features/creating-game-thrones-valyrian-language"" rel=""noreferrer"">not a linguist</a>, and as such he has not done a great deal of linguistic heavy lifting in his storyverse. I believe this shows through in the narrative's use of language; while it can be argued that the Common Tongue of Westeros is <em>not</em> an analogue to English (the English books then being a translation of that Common Tongue), it's my general sense from many of the place names and common idioms in use (especially in the north) that the language of the characters in Westeros really is analogous to a pre-modern form of English, say a century or so after Shakespeare.</p>

<p>I'm wondering, though, if there is any firmer evidence that there are other language analogues in Westeros or Essos. For example, it's probably uncontroversial to posit that Valyrian holds a similar position in Essosi society that Latin holds in European society, being the language of a foundational empire and a progenator of several contemporary Essosi tongues and dialects, but that does not make Valyrian analogous <em>as a language</em> to Latin. To be analogous in the sense that I mean, a speaker of a real-world language should be able to hold a basic conversation with a speaker of a Westerosi or Essosi language.</p>

<p>Is there any evidence that Dornish, say, is analogous to Spanish, or that the tongue of the Children of the Forest is analogous to Gaelic?</p>

<hr>

<p><em>Note: this question primarily concerns the books, but I would not be opposed to show-canon answers or comments.</em></p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><languages>","135550","<p><strong>Short Answer</strong></p>

<p>There is no in-world evidence that any non-common tongue language is analogous to any real-world language. There is canon evidence to the contrary for the Dothraki and Valyrian languages. There is evidence from the author that, <em>currently</em>, apart from the common tongue, no languages in <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> are or are not considered to be analogous to any real-world language, as he just hasn't thought about it (although he does seem to like what David J. Peterson has done with Dothraki and Valyrian).</p>

<p><strong>Long Answer</strong></p>

<p>First of all, these pages list (as far as I'm aware) all of the times that other (non-common tongue) languages appear in the books:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""http://wiki.dothraki.org/Original_Corpus"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dothraki (Corpus)</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://wiki.dothraki.org/High_Valyrian_Corpus"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">High Valyrian(Corpus)</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://wiki.dothraki.org/Other_languages"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Other languages</a>: The Common Tongue, The Old Tongue, High Valyrian, Low Valyrian (Tyroshi, Braavosi and Slaver Cities), Ghiscari, Qartheen, The Language of Asshai, Lhazareen, The Summer Tongue, The Trade Tongue, Other Languages (Jogos Nhai, Bayasabhad, Shamyriana, Kayakayanaya, Ibbenese, etc.), The Children of the Forest's language, The Others' Language, Necromancy and communication between animals such as Direwolves.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now, David J. Peterson created the languages in the TV show, but to do this he had to start with the languages in the books. Apart from the above words in the books he took inspiration for Dothraki from <a href=""http://dothraki.conlang.org/official-hbo-press-release/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Russian, Turkish, Estonian, Inuktitut and Swahili</a>. He has also said <a href=""http://www.tor.com/2010/04/22/creating-dothraki-an-interview-with-david-j-peterson-and-sai-emrys/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""To an untrained ear, it might sound like Arabic. To someone who knows Arabic, it doesn’t. I tend to think of the sound as a mix between Arabic (minus the distinctive pharyngeals) and Spanish, due to the dental consonants.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, Dothraki is unlike any individual real-world language. Especially considering that there are so few words in the books.</p>

<p>As for Valyrian, there's High Valyrian, which plays the equivalent role to Latin. There's also Low Valyrian, which is what's actually spoken and are actually a series of related languages, equivalent to the Romance languages. Again, none of the Valyrian languages would be analogous to a real-world language (dead or otherwise).</p>

<p>In terms of out of world comments from GRRM, from <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1250/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The best I could do was try to sketch in each of the chief tongues of my imaginary world in broad strokes, and give them each their characteristic sounds and spellings.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Suggesting that he might have an idea of what the languages sound like, although he's not saying that any of his languages are or are not analogous to any real-world languages, he seems to be saying that he's thinking of them in terms of what they sound like. This does suggest that, as he cannot actually speak any languages other than English.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2010/04/12/klaatu-barada-nicto/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>, GRRM just made up the words that he needed in the book and this further suggests that (considering how important Valyrian is) he hasn't really thought about any of the languages apart from the basic sound and spelling. Or,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Uh... well... all I know about High Valyrian is the seven words I've made up to date. When I need an eighth, I'll make that up too... but I don't have a whole imaginary language in my desk here, the way Tolkien did."" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which suggests that whether or not any of the created languages are analogous to any real-world languages just hasn't been thought of.</p>

<p>We know they are not <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Wights"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wights</a> so they are something else other than reanimated corpses.
So what happens to the babies? Do they grow like normal humans? Or is the process something different and something else happen? </p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","133490","<p>It is simply unknown as of now. </p>

<p>Others are a mysterical species who are most certainly not dead. One key aspect of life is <em>growing up</em>. Quoting GRRM:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Others are not dead. They are strange, beautiful… think, oh… the
  Sidhe made of ice, something like that… a different sort of life…
  inhuman, elegant, dangerous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Following is the compilation of available info and inferences drawn on that info from both Canons:</p>

<h2>Books</h2>

<p>In Books, there is no explicit indication of what exactly do Others do to the offered children. But it is heavily implied that they make them one of them which in turn implies that somehow the Others are either incapable of reproducing or they can't reproduce fast enough to build their army for the upcoming war. </p>

<p>It has been 8000 years since Others were defeated. The information about them is virtually none. Even the Night's Watch has lost its knowledge about their kind. So as of now, we do not know what exactly is the process involved in making one  A white Walker. </p>

<p>We know Craster offers his sons to the Others. From Jon III ACOK:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If it’s a girl, that’s not so bad, she’ll grown in a few years and
  he’d marry her. But Nella says its to be a boy, and she’s had six and
  knows these things. <strong>He gives the boys to the gods</strong>. Come the white
  cold, he does and of late it comes more often.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since many of Craster's daughters did grow up in his life time and he did marry them, it is implied that many of his sons must have grown up as well, albeit as the Others, not as humans. </p>

<p>One of Craster's wives confirmed this to Sam after <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Mutiny_at_Craster%27s_Keep"" rel=""noreferrer"">mutiny at Craster's keep</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The boy’s bothers… Craster’s sons. The white cold's rising out there,
  crow. I can feel it in my bones. These poor old bones don’t lie.
  <strong>They’ll be here soon, the sons</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If she says they will be here soon, that means they must have grown up. It is implied because well, toddlers can't walk or travel by themselves. If the boy's brothers are coming, they must have grown up into adults. After all, in all the encounters with Others, we haven't seen a single instance of an infant Other coming to stick his icy blade in someone's heart. </p>

<p>The event depicted in the Show in this regard never happened in the Books.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Show</h2>

<p>In show it is explicitly described that the Others turn the babies into their kind, as evident from the video linked in your own post. </p>

<p>As for the process involved, only thing that we see is that the Night's king just has touch a Child and convert him into a White Walker. But I don't believe only touch is required because Night's King also touched Bran but he did not turn into a White Walker. </p>

<p>So it appears, only infants can be converted into White Walkers, Adults have to be killed and reanimated as Wights, thralls to the Others.</p>

<p>It is not known if all White Walkers can convert an infant into one of them or only Night's King can do that. It is likely that only Night's King can do that because rest of the Others simply put the child down there to await his Majesty's pleasure. None of them made any attempt to convert the child and waited for their leader. </p>

<p>About Growth of Others, we do not know anything. But since they converted Infants, it is probable that the converted boys grow up into youth of the Others. </p>

<p>Another point to note is that their growth and aging process appears to be different than humans. Night's King was supposedly created during First Men-Children of the Forest wars which happened 12,000 years ago. He seems pretty fit for a 12,000+ years old guy.</p>

<p>We know that the Martells were already allied to the Targaryens, because of the marriage between Rheagar and Elia.<br>
But where did the Tyrells' loyalty lie during the last days of the Mad King and what role did they play?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","133610","<p>Tyrells were Targaryen loyalists till the bitter end. They dipped their banners only once King's Landing had been taken by the Rebels.</p>

<hr>

<p>When the Dragons came with Aegon the Conqueror, King <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Mern_IX_Gardener"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mern IX of House Gardener</a> ruled the Reach. Tyrells were only stewards of the Kings of the Reach. As it happened, King Mern chose to fight the invading Targaryens and perished in <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Field_of_Fire"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Field of Fire</a> along with rest of his kin. The royal dynasty of the Reach went extinct in that battle. </p>

<p>When the news reached High Garden, it was the High Steward of the Reach named <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Harlen_Tyrell"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Harlan Tyrell</a> who surrendered the Kingdom to King Aegon Targaryen. Aegon rewarded Harlan with titles of Lord Paramount of the Reach and Warden of the South even though other Houses of Reach had better claim on the titles due to their kinship to the extinct House Gardener. So, Tyrells got their status as Great House only due to Targaryens, unlike other great houses who were Kings once e.g. Starks, Lannisters and Arryns. They have always answered the call of the Iron throne and stood by the Targaryens in challenging times like Blackfyre rebellions, Dornish wars etc. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Robert's Rebellion</h2>

<p>They however failed to play a much greater role for the loyalist Armies mostly because of the incompetence of Lord Tyrell and stubbornness of Stannis Baratheon. Following is a complete breakdown of their operations during the war:</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_Ashford"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Battle of Ashford</a></strong></p>

<p>The Tyrells and Baratheons first clashed at the North-Eastern border town of the Reach named Ashford.</p>

<p>During the Rebellion, Stormlands were completely isolated from their allies in Vale, North and Riverlands. So Robert wanted to advance his forces north and link up with his allies before he could be trapped between the loyalist forces of Dorne, Reach and Crownlands. But he had to first deal with Storm Lords who were trying to rise up for the King.</p>

<p>Robert had won <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battles_at_Summerhall"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">victories at Summerhall</a> against those Lords and now had the complete support of Stormlands behind him. With home front secured, Robert advanced North-Westwards to link up with his allies; The Houses Tully, Arryn and Stark. </p>

<p>Naturally, to reach Riverlands, Robert had to either cross the Crownlands or the Reach. Robert chose to cross through the Reach and came upon the border town of Ashford. It is unclear if Robert tried to take Ashford castle before advancing to Riverlands but we know he was soon faced by Tyrells. Lord Mace had bestirred himself and Lord Randyll Tarly, known as finest soldier in the realm, had reached Ashford with his vanguard. </p>

<p>Tarly did not wait for main Tyrell Army to arrive and charged at the Stormlanders. Stormlanders suffered losses and on arrival of main Tyrell Army, Robert was forced to withdraw to Riverlands. This is the only defeat Robert ever suffered.</p>

<p>Since the Stormlander Army had retreated into Riverlands, the way was clear for Tyrells to lay siege to Storm's End itself, the ancestral seat of House Baratheon. That's exactly what they did. Lord Mace Tyrell advanced Eastwards and laid siege to the Castle of Storm's End. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_at_the_Mander"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Battle of Mander</a></strong></p>

<p>This battle happened after the Battle of The Trident, where Prince Rhaegar died and the fate of the loyalists was sealed. Lord Paramount of Iron Islands, Quellon Greyjoy had so far been neutral in the civil war but in the aftermath of The Trident, he was persuaded by his sons to enter the war on Robert's side, lest they lose all chance to win glory and plunder. </p>

<p>Lord Quellon sailed to attack the Reach from rear with his sons. He took only a small part of Iron fleet with him because Lannisters were at that time still neutral and could pose a threat to Iron Islands if they declared for Targaryens.  The Greyjoy navy plundered and burned their way along the coast until they were met by Tyrell naval units from Shield Islands. The Ironborn proved their reputation as greatest seafaring people in the Seven Kingdoms and emerged victorious. Lord Quellon Greyjoy was however slain and his son Balon decided to return to Pyke to take his father's seat. This was the only attack mounted by Rebels on Reach itself. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Siege_of_Storm%27s_End"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Siege of Storm's End</a></strong></p>

<p>In the Aftermath of Battle of Ashford, Tyrells had laid siege to Storm's End. This made matters very grim for the Baratheons because their army was in Riverlands, cut off from their lands so no relief force could be sent to break the siege.</p>

<p>Tyrells had outstanding numerical superiority but they did not have one thing; the iron will possessed by Stannis Baratheon. Stannis refused to surrender the castle and kept defying the besieging Armies. </p>

<p>Since Storm's End is a very strong castle and it is said that the trebuchet which could punch a hole in its curtain wall had never been created, so Besiegers were happy to starve out the Baratheons inside the castle. Soon the Redwyne and Tyrell fleets arrived and Storm's End was cut off from sea as well.</p>

<p>Stannis, though out of food, refused to surrender still. He and the garrison instead ate cats, dogs and shoes but they held on, tying a huge part of Loyalist Army in siege of Storm's End which could have been put to other use elsewhere. If Storm's End had fallen, Tyrells would have joined the other Royalist Armies and the outcome of The Battle of The Trident could have been the death of Robert instead of death of Rhaegar.</p>

<p>But Storm's End did not fall, due to the iron leadership of Stannis Baratheon and supplies brought by a lowborn smuggler named Davos. In the meanwhile, Rebels killed Prince Rhaegar at The Trident and King's Landing itself fell to Rebels. Soon Lord Eddard moved with his men to Storm's End and notified the Tyrells about the outcome of the war. Tyrells, upon learning that Rhaegar was dead and Aerys was slain with most of the royal family, dipped their banners. The war was lost. Robert pardoned the Tyrells and their vassals and confirmed them in their rights and titles. </p>

<p>My own speculative conclusion is that Benjen's case is probably different since he is not exactly a whight, and wights should be able to cross the door. I think the White Walkers are not crossing waiting to have a large enough army of wights to make the attempt.

<p>It doesn't make much sense for Dany who (at this point) was the frightened dependent younger sibling to have a diminutive nickname for the egotistical bully of an older brother she spent much of her life in fear of.</p>

<hr>

<p>We know that Viserys took himself <em>very</em> seriously, calling himself a king and a 'dragon' in the face of constant mockery, and that he tended to take his frustrations out on his little sister who he threatened and bullied. In the TV show, all we really see of Dany's early years are her looking lost, depressed, fearful and passive in the first episode, and him casually threatening her in other episodes. In the books, we understand that she'd spent much of her early childhood dependent on Viserys, looking up to him in a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome"" rel=""noreferrer"">Stockholm Syndrome</a> sort of way, and she didn't begin to question his version of who he was until later. </p>

<p>The other nicknames Visy has (book only, if I remember right) are all mocking:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dubbed ""Beggar King"" by the Essos-based nobles he begs for support</li>
<li>Dubbed ""Cart King"" and ""Sorefoot King"" by the Dothraki who laugh at him tagging along behind his sister not understanding that walking or sitting on a cart instead of riding are considered shameful in their culture</li>
</ul>

<p>The few allies Visy had were people like Illyrio who massaged his ego in the hope of becoming the power behind the absolute ruler of a continent - they too would therefore not give him an irreverent, affectionate or childish nickname but would inflate his ego and encourage him to think of himself as a serious king.</p>

"133822","Why does Daenerys get a title on her birth?","<p>First of all, i would like to clarify that my question is not a duplicate of <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/33390/why-is-daenerys-called-stormborn"">this question</a>. I know where the title “Stormborn” comes from, but my question is why does she have it at all?</p>

<p>I don't recall (m)any other characters having a title that they received at birth.</p>

<p>I understand that people are given titles/nicknames that they earned or are given by others:</p>

<ul>
<li>Jaime Lannister: The Kingslayer, given to him for killing his own king</li>
<li>Robb Stark: The Young Wolf, given to him for being a young Stark who fights a war  </li>
<li>Jon Snow: King Crow, given to him by the wildlings for being the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch</li>
<li>Daenerys Targaryen: Mother of Dragons, self-proclaimed title for bringing 3 dragons into the world</li>
<li>Daenerys Targaryen: Breaker of chains, self-proclaimed title for freeing slaves in Slavers Bay</li>
</ul>

<p>Throughout the TV series we see many people with these types of titles:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Mountain</li>
<li>The Hound</li>
<li>Barristan the Bold</li>
<li>The Red Viper of Dorne</li>
<li>The Black Fish</li>
<li>Lord of Bones</li>
<li>Etc...</li>
</ul>

<p>We know that Daenerys has many titles and she loves telling people all of them, but <strong>why did she get a title at birth?</strong> No one else seems to run around with a title about the conditions that they were born in.</p>

<p>Also, the storm destroyed the Targaryen fleet.. Its not as if the storm brought victory for the Targaryens.</p>

<p>Is there any elaboration about this anywhere?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","133823","<h2>Why did Daenerys get her epithet?</h2>

<p>The Night Daenerys was born, a huge storm raged outside Dragonstone. It was so fierce that it smashed the Royal fleet anchored in the bay. Amidst this Storm, Queen Rhaella gave birth to her youngest child who was named Daenerys. That's why she got the epithet Stormborn.</p>

<h2>Did anyone else got such a nickname upon his/her birth?</h2>

<p>Yes. It's just like <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aemon_Steelsong"">Mance Rayder's son</a>, Aemon, called Battleborn, Steel Song and Blood-born because he was born during the decisive <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_of_Castle_Black"">Battle of Castle Black</a>. Some people are born in something important or significant and thus get names out of it. Mance's son Aemon was born in a battle and thus is called Battleborn, and Daenerys was born in a great storm and is therefore called Stormborn.</p>

<h2>How do you get nicknames?</h2>

<p>Nicknames don't have to be earned by others. You can get them from your own traits or simply because of your birth if something significant happened at birth. </p>

<p>Aemon (Son of Mance Rayder) and Daenerys got their names because of their birth.</p>

<p>Daemon Blackfyre chose his own name from his sword. </p>

<p>Ser Duncan the tall named himself the Tall because he was well, tall. </p>

<p>Of the examples you cited:</p>

<ol>
<li>Jaime got his epithet from his crime of killing King Aerys. Until then, he was the Young Lion, not Kingslayer.</li>
<li>Robb Stark got his epithet from his House's sigil, his youth and his pet direwolf.</li>
<li>Jon Snow was awarded various names like Lord Snow, King Crow, Crow from different people.</li>
<li>The Mountain got his name from his immense size.</li>
<li>The Hound got his name from his House's sigil and his hound shaped helm.</li>
<li>Barristan the Bold was given his nickname by Prince Duncan the Small for his courage of appearing in lists at very young age.</li>
<li>Red Viper got his name due to his sinister reputation and his dabbling in poison. </li>
<li>Black Fish chose his own name when his brother Hoster Tully once called him ""Black goat of Tully flock"". Brynden Tully told his brother that their sigil was a trout so he must be Black fish, not goat.</li>
<li>Lord of Bones proclaimed himself as such. He got that name from wearing an armour made of bones.</li>
</ol>

<p>As you can see, they all chose their names or got their names due to their traits but nothing significant happened at their births, unlike Aemon and Daenerys. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>While there are no canon rules for such nicknames, we can however determine a basic set of how people do get these names from these examples:</p>

<ol>
<li>Significance of events around birth</li>
<li>Some great deed</li>
<li>Some great crime</li>
<li>Some physical feature</li>
<li>Some sort of knowledge</li>
<li>Personal choice</li>
<li>Some outlook trait</li>
<li>Insulting epithet based on some physical disability or low birth etc</li>
<li>Dynasty's sigil</li>

"133829","Why did the Targaryens choose Dragonstone after the visions of Daenys?","<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daenys_Targaryen"">Daenys ""The Dreamer"" Targaryen</a> had visions of the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Doom_of_Valyria"">Doom of Valyria</a>, so <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aenar_Targaryen"">Aenar ""The Exile"" Targaryen</a> relocated his whole clan to <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Dragonstone"">Dragonstone</a>.</p>

<p>One explanation could be Daenys also foresaw the <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Century_of_Blood"">Century of Blood</a>, but did she?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","133837","<p>This cannot be answered from any canon source so following would be informed speculation and logical inference.</p>

<h2>Uncertainty of Dragon Dreams</h2>

<p>Daenys saw doom of Valyria in her dreams. Since we know that dragon dreams are just signs involving dragons, whose truth can vary quite opposite to the dreamer's interpretation, Daenys could not be sure if the dream was about just mainland Valyria or her complete Empire. From <em>Dunk &amp; Egg: The Hedge Knight</em>, we see an example of Dragon dream, seen by Prince <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daeron_Targaryen_(son_of_Maekar_I)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Daeron Targaryen</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I dreamed of you,” said the prince.</p>
  
  <p>“You said that at the inn.”</p>
  
  <p>“Did I? Well, it’s so. My dreams are not like yours, Ser Duncan. Mine
  are true. They frighten me. You frighten me. I dreamed of you and a
  dead dragon, you see. A great beast, huge, with wings so large they
  could cover this meadow. It had fallen on top of you, but you were
  alive and the dragon was dead.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another example of Dragon Dream, dreamed by <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daemon_II_Blackfyre"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Daemon II Blackfyre</a>, from <em>Dunk &amp; Egg: The Mystery Knight</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""A dragon will hatch? A living dragon? What, here?""</p>
  
  <p>""I dreamed it. This pale white castle, you, a dragon bursting from an
  egg, I dreamed it all, just as I once dreamed of my brothers lying
  dead. They were twelve and I was only seven, so they laughed at me,
  and died. I am two-and-twenty now, and I trust my dreams.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you see these, dreams do not indicate exact future. They just symbolise it. In first Dream, the dreamer could not determine which Dragon would be killed by Ser Duncan. In second dream, the dreamer mistook exposing <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon_V_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Prince Aegon</a>'s true identity to be indicative of a real dragon hatching. </p>

<p>So as you can see, Dreams can be wrongly interpreted which is why other Dragon Lords did not believe Daenys' dreams. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Doom of Valyria</h2>

<p>We know that in Doom, Valyria burnt from both earth and air. In ADWD Chapter 38, Tyrion recalls that it was written that on the day of Doom every hill for 500 miles had split asunder to fill the air with ash and smoke and fire, blazes so hot and hungry that even dragons in the sky were engulfed and consumed.</p>

<p>Great rents had opened in the earth, swallowing palaces, temples, entire towns. Lakes boiled or turned to acid, mountains burst, fiery fountains spewed molten rock a thousand feet into the air, red clouds rained down dragonglass and the black blood of demons, and to the north the ground splintered and collapsed and fell in on itself and an angry sea came rushing in</p>

<p>So it is possible that Daenys may have seen fire engulfing Valyria or fire engulfing dragons. Sadly we do not know the exact dream Daenys saw. But since she made her father leave Valyria and Aenar chose Island of Dragonstone, the choice seems to be made with preference of keeping a body of water between Valyria and themselves. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Why Dragonstone?</h2>

<p>Valyrians had conquered Dragonstone 200 years before the Doom. It was at that time the Western most extent of the Valyrian Freehold. So the probable reasons for Aenar's choice seem to be following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Dragonstone was the Western most outpost of Valyria. This was as far as Aenar could have run without exiling himself from the Freehold entirely.</li>
<li>Daenys could not be sure about true extent of her dream. Did it mean the whole Empire or did it mean just Valyria itself? </li>
<li>Dragonstone was an Island and was seperated from rest of the Freehold by Sea. If Daenys had seen a great fire in her vision, it would make sense to put a body of water between them and the great fire. They could not flee to Eastern most outposts of the Freehold because they were all connected to Valyria by Land. Remember Valyria only became an Island after the doom. Before Doom, it was a Peninsula. </li>
</ol>

<p>But judging on these reasons, another candidate land arises. The Island of Lorath. Lorath is Northern most outpost of the former Freehold and it is also an Island. Why did Aenar choose Dragonstone instead of Lorath is something which <s>can't be answered</s> is actually answered by <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/68466/travis-kindred"">Travis Kindred</a> below. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Our esteemed Member <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/68466/travis-kindred"">Travis Kindred</a> has provided an excellent argument about Dragonstone's good environmental conditions for Dragon Breeding.  Not stealing his point, just using it to answer <em>Why did not Aenar choose Lorath instead of Dragonstone?</em>. The Answer would be that Aenar was more inclined to choose Dragonstone because of the favourable environment. Just summarising it for someone who might not reach this conclusion from Travis' answer.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Did She see Essosi wars between Valyrian Colonies?</h2>

<p>We cannot say if she did see that. But even if she did see that, Targaryens would have no cause to worry because they had <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Balerion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a dragon</a> while the colonies had none. Also since Targaryens, Velaryons and Celtigars were of the pure blood of Valyria, they would be most welcome by the city state of Volantis which was the closest to Valyria than all other colonies. So that does not appear to be a reason behind the self-imposed exile to dragonstone. </p>

"199540","How do the ironborn choose their leader?","<p>From having recently watched <em>Game of Thrones</em>, Season 6, Episode 5, ""The Door"", it appears that the ironborn elect their leader.</p>

<p>From the noted episode it looks like leadership contenders gather with a crowd of a few dozen ironborn and make their case for leadership. After Yara makes her case, the gathered crowd chants ""Yara! Yara!..."", and after Euron makes his case, the crowd chants ""Euron! Euron!..."". I imagine the latter is done by more of the crowd and/or louder than for Yara.</p>

<p>From watching the episode, the election seems like a spur-of-the-moment popularity contest to see which contender gets the most/loudest support. </p>

<p><strong>Is the ironborn election any deeper than that?</strong> </p>

<p>As depicted in the episode, the election process struck me as rather shallow in a world that is otherwise deeply fleshed out (I imagined the brevity was necessary for pacing/time constraint reasons in a TV show, which is understandable). Is the ironborn election process explained with more detail in the books, and if so, could someone please describe it?</p>

<p>I've searched GoT/aSoIaF wikis and other search results for ""ironborn election"", etc. but haven't found a detailed description of it.</p>

  <p>A roar went up at that, and the drowned men beat their cudgels one against the other. ""A kingsmoot!"" they shouted. ""A kingsmoot, a kingsmoot. No king but from the kingsmoot!"" And the clamor that they made was so thunderous that surely the Crow's Eye heard the shouts on Pyke, and the vile Storm God in his cloudy hall. And Aeron Damphair knew he had done well.</p>

The offerings that his men spilled out before the kingsmoot included sealskins and walrus tusks, arm rings made of whalebone, warhorns banded in bronze. The captains looked and turned away, leaving lesser men to help themselves to the gifts. When the fool was done talking and his champions began to shout his name, only the Farwynds took up the cry, and not even all of them. Soon enough the cries of ""Gylbert! Gylbert King!"" faded away to silence.</p>

<p>Euron promised them basically the world, even claiming he could tame dragons with a horn he found.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""IRONMEN,"" said Euron Greyjoy, ""you have heard my horn. Now hear my words. I am Balon's brother, Quellon's eldest living son. Lord Vickon's blood is in my veins, and the blood of the Old Kraken. Yet I have sailed farther than any of them. <strong>Only one living kraken has never known defeat. Only one has never bent his knee. Only one has sailed to Asshai by the Shadow, and seen wonders and terrors beyond imagining . . .""</strong></p>
  
  <p>""If you liked the Shadow so well, go back there,"" called out pink-cheeked Qarl the Maid, one of Asha's champions.</p>
  
  <p>""I know as much of war as you do, Crow's Eye,"" Asha said. ""Aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros with dragons.""</p>
  
  <p>""And so shall we,"" Euron Greyjoy promised. ""That horn you heard I found amongst the smoking ruins that were Valyria, where no man has dared to walk but me. You heard its call, and felt its power. It is a dragon horn, bound with bands of red gold and Valyrian steel graven with enchantments. The dragonlords of old sounded such horns, before the Doom devoured them. <strong>With this horn, ironmen, I can bind dragons to my will.""</strong></p>
  
  <p>Asha laughed aloud. ""A horn to bind goats to your will would be of more use, Crow's Eye. There are no more dragons.""</p>
  
  <p>""Again, girl, you are wrong. There are three, and I know where to find them. Surely that is worth a driftwood crown.""</p>
  
  <p>""EURON!"" shouted Left-Hand Lucas Codd.</p>

<p>And in the end Euron laid the best claim and had the most ""votes"";</p>

  <p>""EURON! CROW'S EYE! EURON!"" cried the Red Oarsman.</p>
  
  <p><strong>The mutes and mongrels from the Silence threw open Euron's chests and spilled out his gifts before the captains and the kings.</strong> Then it was Hotho Harlaw the priest heard, as he filled his hands with gold. Gorold Goodbrother shouted out as well, and Erik Anvil-Breaker. ""EURON! EURON! EURON!"" The cry swelled, became a roar. ""EURON! EURON! CROW'S EYE! EURON KING!"" It rolled up Nagga's hill, like the Storm God rattling the clouds. ""EURON! EURON! EURON! EURON! EURON! EURON!""
  Even a priest may doubt. Even a prophet may know terror. Aeron Damphair reached within himself for his god and discovered only silence. <strong>As a thousand voices shouted out his brother's name, all he could hear was the scream of a rusted iron hinge.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>As always our fine Maesters sum it up in a much shorter version. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Elsewhere in Westeros, petty kings claimed crowns of gold by virtue of their birth and blood, but the driftwood crowns of the ironborn were not so easily won. <strong>Here alone in all of Westeros men made their own kings, assembling in great councils called kingsmoots to choose the rock kings and salt kings who would rule over them. Whenever a king died, the priests of the Drowned God would call a kingsmoot to choose his successor.</strong> Every man who owned and captained a boat was allowed a voice at these unruly gatherings, which oft went on for days, and in a few instances far longer. The ironborn also tell of occasions when the priests called ""the captains and the kings"" together to remove an unworthy ruler.</p>
  
  <p><strong>The power wielded by these prophets of the Drowned God over the ironborn should not be underestimated. Only they could summon kingsmoots, and woe to the man, be he lord or king, who dared defy them.</strong> The greatest of the priests was the towering prophet Galon Whitestaff, so-called for the tall carved staff he carried everywhere to smite the ungodly. (In some tales his staff was made of weirwood, in others from one of Nagga's bones.)</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Iron Islands came under the rule of the Greyjoys when they took it by force and woe to any who opposed them.</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Torgon had struck one blow against the institution of the kingsmoot in his youth, by throwing over its chosen king. In his old age he struck another, calling upon his own son Urragon to help him rule.</strong> At court and council, in war and peace, the son remained at his father's side for the best part of five years, so when Torgon finally died it seemed only natural for his chosen heir to succeed him as Urragon IV Greyiron. <strong>No kingsmoot was summoned, and this time no Galon Whitestaff arose in wroth to protest the succession.</strong></p>
  
  <p>The final, fatal blow against the power of the captains and the kings assembled was dealt when Urragon IV himself died, after a long but undistinguished reign. It had been the dying king's wish that the high kingship pass to his great-nephew Urron Greyiron, salt king of Orkmont, known as Urron Redhand. <strong>The priests of the Drowned God were determined not to allow the power of kingmaking to be taken from them for a third time, so word went forth that the captains and kings should assemble on Old Wyk for a kingsmoot.</strong></p>
  
  <p>Hundreds came, amongst them the salt kings and rock kings of the seven major isles, and even the Lonely Light. Yet scarcely had they gathered when Urron Redhand loosed his axemen on them, and Nagga's ribs ran red with blood. <strong>Thirteen kings died that day, and half a hundred priests and prophets. It was the end of the kingsmoots, and the Redhand ruled as high king for twenty-two years thereafter, and his descendants after him. The wandering holy men never again made and unmade kings as they once had.</strong></p>

"133925","Why the giant did not use any weapons in the battle?","<p>In the <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4283088/"" rel=""noreferrer"">S6E9</a> we see a rather impressive battle.</p>

<p>Ramsay Snow has battle advantage, so for Jon Snow it is obvious to make his warriors useful as much as possible. But we see that a giant, who can be worth a hundred men, does not use any weapons at all. Is it so difficult to give him a club from a tree trunk and a big shield? Previously as I remember giants used huge bows at least.</p>

<p>So is there any reason not to give a weapon to the giant? According to books or maybe screenplay if I've missed it.</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","133926","<p>From this <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Giants"">wiki</a>, you can read that they can use crude weapons.</p>

<p>In the books, it is mentioned more than once that they usually use tree trunks. I think it is mentioned once that they can tie a boulder at the end of the tree trunk to make a some sort of crude maul.</p>

<p>In the series they did not do it. I can speculate two reasons why the directors did not let him get a tree trunk.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Shooting scenes with giants is not easy. One of the directors said having a man and digitally making it 4 meters is not good enough. So, they hired the tallest actors available, made him large by some foam suit and they got something about 2.5 meters. Only then they digitally enhance it to 4 meters. So, a club, i.e., a tree trunk over there might simply be too much work or might not look realistic.</p></li>
<li><p>Giants can follow clear commands but lack the intelligence. A battle in fact is not only about brute force, but about fighting in formation. This requires more capability, trust and discipline. With a tree trunk, Wun Wun might unintentionally hurt his allies. As a similar information, you can check <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_elephant"">here</a> how elephants running amok affects battles and how it is prevented.</p></li>

"133931","The War of the Five Kings has removed the importance of being a Warden (at least in the North)?","<p>Being a <em>Warden</em> allowed you to control armies. But, that power was contingent on the Seven Kingdoms being intact. The outbreak of the War of the 5 Kings fractured the Seven Kingdoms and seemingly left a <em>Warden</em> (especially in the North) with no resources to control.</p>

<p>But, in Season 5, episode 6, Baelish had this dialogue with Cersei:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> <strong>BAELISH</strong>: Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor, marching with his army on Winterfell. Let Stannis and Roose battle, let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when they’re done seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives.<br>
 <strong>CERSEI</strong>: Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here. The weather has already begun to turn.<br>
 <strong>BAELISH</strong>: That is why it is critical to strike soon, while the victor still licks his wounds. Perhaps I can help. The Knights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros, trained to battle in the ice and the snow.<br>
 .....<br>
 <strong>CERSEI</strong>: And if you succeed?<br>
 <strong>BAELISH</strong>: Name me Warden of the North.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>After Battle of Bastards, Baelish could have easily done what he said he would do. But, instead, he had his forces stand down.</p>

<p>A <em>King in the North</em> would control all the forces the <em>Warden of the North</em> once controlled?  </p>

<p>Baelish knew that the North basically already seceded with Robb Stark declared as <em>King in the North</em>, yet Baelish still wanted the title of <em>Warden of the North</em>?  </p>

<p>A final twist, in season 6, episode 9, is that Baelish told Sansa that the Vale has declared for the <em>King in the North</em>, thus betraying the Iron Throne, right? Or, maybe he lied and betrayed Sansa?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Not quite. In the TV show, The War of the Five Kings broke out when the former Warden of the North, Ned Stark, was imprisoned by the crown, and his son Robb declared war. While the North eventually demanded secession during this war, this idea died once Robb was defeated — there was no more King in the North.</p>

<p>Roose Bolton was named Warden of the North, and started raising taxes on the Northern houses much as the Starks had done before (you may remember <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Medger_Cerwyn"" rel=""nofollow"">a conversation between Roose and Ramsay on this subject</a> in season 5, episode 3).</p>

<p>So as far as Cersei knows, Baelish is happy for her to rule the Seven Kingdoms, including The North, as long as he’s Warden of the North. But, as you say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A final twist, in season 6, episode 9, is that Baelish told Sansa that the Vale has declared for the King in the North, thus betraying the Iron Throne, right? Or, maybe he lied and betrayed Sansa?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So yup, could be either. Baelish did say to Sansa that what he wants is to sit on the Iron Throne, with Sansa at his side. Presuming this statement is true (he’s putting in a lot of effort and risk if he <em>doesn’t</em> want to be King himself), he has indeed intentionally betrayed the Iron Throne — but presuming this statement is also in order of priority, his loyalty to Sansa could change at any time if doing so would get Baelish’s bum closer to the big metal chair.</p>

<p>&quot;There is an inn at the crossroads up ahead,&quot; Catelyn told him. She had slept many a night there in her youth, traveling with her father. Lord Hoster Tully had been a restless man in his prime, always riding somewhere. She still remembered the innkeep, a fat woman named Masha Heddle who chewed sourleaf night and day and seemed to have an endless supply of smiles and sweet cakes for the children. The sweet cakes had been soaked with honey, rich and heavy on the tongue, but how Catelyn had dreaded those smiles. The sourleaf had stained Masha's teeth a dark red, and made her smile a bloody horror.</p>

<p>When they reached the door—a tall oval mouth, set in a wall fashioned in the likeness of a human face—the smallest dwarf Dany had ever seen was waiting on the threshold. He stood no higher than her knee, his faced pinched and pointed, snoutish, but he was dressed in delicate livery of purple and blue, and his tiny pink hands held a silver tray. Upon it rested a slender crystal glass filled with a thick blue liquid: shade of the evening, the wine of warlocks. &quot;Take and drink,&quot; urged Pyat Pree.</p>
<p>&quot;Will it turn my lips blue?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One flute will serve only to unstop your ears and dissolve the caul from off your eyes, so that you may hear and see the truths that will be laid before you.&quot;</p>
<p>Dany raised the glass to her lips. The first sip tasted like ink and spoiled meat, foul, but when she swallowed it seemed to come to life within her. She could feel tendrils spreading through her chest, like fingers of fire coiling around her heart, and on her tongue was a taste like honey and anise and cream, like mother's milk and Drogo's seed, like red meat and hot blood and molten gold. It was all the tastes she had ever known, and none of them... and then the glass was empty.</p>

<p>Or is this because Sansa has a different last name now (if she is still a Bolton)?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><jon-snow>","134177","<p>This comes up a lot, so I'm answering it in detail. It's addressed (subtly) in dialogue, and follows a key theme of the story. If you want a quick read, I wrote <a href=""https://movies.stackexchange.com/a/56788/9718"">a short version on the Film &amp; TV site</a>.</p>

<h2>Sansa doesn't want to rule.</h2>

<p>Neither does Jon, of course. Neither has shown any sign of enjoying politics and both have suffered horribly from being in the limelight, and (I realise this is unusual for Game of Thrones characters) neither is a psychopathic megalomaniac motivated by lust for power.</p>

<p>We even see a debate between the two, where both encourage the other to step up. Of the two - Sansa and Jon - Sansa is now <em>by far</em> the more skilled politician and manipulator (in the TV show: in the books she's still literally struggling to manipulate stubborn children out of bed), and therefore, Sansa wins. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Jon:</strong> I'm having the lord's chamber prepared for you. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Sansa:</strong> Mother and Father's room? You should take it. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Jon:</strong> I'm not a Stark. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Sansa:</strong> You are to me. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Jon:</strong> You're the Lady of Winterfell.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Sansa:</strong> You deserve it. We're standing here because of you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...So first, she convinces Jon to think of himself as a Stark, and makes it clear she doesn't want to step up...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Sansa:</strong> I should have told you about him, about the Knights of the Vale. I'm sorry. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Jon:</strong> We need to trust each other. We can't fight a war amongst ourselves. We have so many enemies now. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Sansa:</strong> Jon. A raven came from the Citadel. A white raven. Winter is here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewtopic.php?f=67&amp;t=27733"" rel=""noreferrer"">Transcript link</a></p>

<p>Notice how she artfully creates a subtext where Jon's duty is to step up and lead, and hers is to inform and support him - wrapped up in what looks like an innocent, welcome apology. She's already been playing on what Jon sees as his duty to protect her and her vulnerability. It's much more subtle than what she did with the Royces in season 4, but the principle is the same: playing on a noble man's sense of duty and honour.</p>

<p>The very next scene we see them in, it's Jon (nervously, reluctantly) putting himself forward at the head of the table, and Sansa (smiling) sitting by his side, letting him take the limelight, the pressure, the responsibility, and the risk.</p>

<h2>Power resides where men think it resides</h2>

<p>I really can't stress this massive, massive theme of the whole story enough - it's essentially the underlying answer to every question of the form ""But technically, don't the rules say..."".</p>

<p>You've got a room full of passionate Northern lords and ladies, not rule-following robots or book-balancing bureaucrats. They're looking at:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The legendary Northern swordsman (according to Ramsay who has no reason to lie about this) Jon Snow, who was the respected leader of the <strike>ramshackle</strike> rugged Castle Black, who led the <strike>inadequate</strike> brave army to Winterfell, who <strike>stupidly</strike> honourably led an incredibly <strike>foolish</strike> courageous charge in a <strike>doomed</strike> noble attempt to save his brother, reminding everyone of the much-loved Ned Stark's unwavering commitment to acts that are <strike>likely to imperil his entire family</strike> right and honourable. He led the army from the front, led the charge into Winterfell, and personally overcame the feared Ramsay - with his bare hands! He's a living legend in the North, sitting at the head of the table, and is talking like a leader. Everyone is talking about him. </p></li>
<li><p>The gentle Sansa, who has spent a long time in the South <strike>battling to survive and developing valuable political skills</strike> eating lemon cakes and doing whatever soft southerners do. She's sat by her half-brother's side, <strike>letting him put his head on the chopping block</strike> dutifully supporting his claim to rule. She <strike>single-handedly won the entire battle</strike> watched the battle from far away, and the faction she <strike>won over and directed</strike> sent letters to are <strike>the only reason they're not all dead</strike> not even Northerners. She's not claiming anything. No-one's talking about her, and she seems perfectly happy that way.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>A majority consensus is emerging that Jon is enough of a Stark. Sansa might seem more obviously a Stark on paper, but we saw earlier that after her marriages and time down south some (e.g. Lyanna Mormont) question whether she's still a true Stark or more of a ""Sansa Bolton"" or ""Sansa Lannister"". </p>

<p>Whatever she is, she seems to support the emerging consensus that Jon should rule, and no-one else has an interest in arguing the point for her. Northern lords aren't the types to say ""Maester! Bring the rulebook! Let it tell us what to do"". They certainly didn't stop to check they were following correct procedures when they spontaneously promoted Robb from Lord to King.</p>

<p>Who are they going to cheer for?</p>

<h2>There's no magic Supreme Court to rigidly enforce the law</h2>

<p>In our world, <em>some</em> countries have <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers"" rel=""noreferrer"">Separation of Powers</a> and an independent body or bodies like a Supreme Court than can hold all powerful people to account and enforce the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law"" rel=""noreferrer"">Rule of Law</a>. Many countries, sadly, don't, even (or, especially) today. If you're lucky enough to live in one of the countries that does, <em>don't</em> take it for granted and assume that in all nations, in all worlds fictional or otherwise, some magical power ensures that rules are followed even when no-one in a position of power wills it. Rule of Law isn't the norm - it's something people fought long and hard for, and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption#Anti-corruption_programmes"" rel=""noreferrer"">still fight to maintain</a>.</p>

<p>Rule of Law is clearly not strong in Westeros, despite the courageous efforts of a rare few (e.g. Ned, Barristan). If you <em>truly</em> can't believe that various shattered war-torn corners of Westeros don't have some strong, independent power that magically enforces the rules regardless of the preferences of the powerful, ask yourself, where was this power when Mad King Aerys decided ""wildfire"" was a valid champion for a trial by combat, and turned a trial into an execution? Or when Joffrey granted himself the unprecedented power to overrule a kingsguard's solemn vow? Or when Cersei ripped up King Robert's decree? Those were more peaceful times, in the South, where the infrastructure of the state was still largely functional (multiple great houses, a semi-independent religious order, small council, citadel, maesters, bureaucrats, etc), unlike the war-torn North where this is the third total change in governmental system in a few years. Despite disapproving mutterings, these nonetheless went largely unchallenged.</p>

<p>Would it even matter if there was a powerful, independent arbiter? Suppose Lady Mormont's maester had been a stickler for the rules, stood proud and produced a rulebook with which he passionately argued that Sansa <em>must</em> inherit whether she wants to or not. Suppose the lords had been swayed by this. Nothing would stop newly crowned Queen Sansa simply formally legitimising Jon and abdicating. There's little practical difference here between her giving Jon informal backing as the eldest known living Stark, and her giving formal backing as a ""five minute Queen"". </p>

<p>It's de facto vs de jure legitimisation. A functional legal system or bureaucracy would care about the difference, but the fact Northern lords don't reinforces something about them we learned when they spontaneously promoted Robb from lord to king without stopping to observe any legal framework or due process. They don't fuss about the details, they act.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Sansa could make a very strong claim here, but it'd be out of character</h2>

<p>She's clearly aware she could. Baelish had even tried (creepily) and failed to talk her into it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Littlefinger:</strong> Who should the North rally to, Sansa? A trueborn daughter of Ned and Catelyn Stark born here at Winterfell or a motherless bastard born in the south?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since everything went crazy in Season 1, all Sansa's actions have been trying to get to a position of relative safety. Before then, her main motivations were lemon cakes and a naive sense of the glamour of knights, courts, kings and castles. She's never shown any interest in power except as a means to try to get a safer or more comfortable position. Even when she was enjoying being betrothed to Joffrey, it was the glamour and false charm that excited her, in stark contrast (see what I did there) to the smart, power-hungry Margaery.</p>

<p>She <em>could</em> easily make a case for herself to be Lady of Winterfell (hell, even Jon wanted her to), but she refused. After everything she's been through, why would she want to be the one in the most dangerous position, under the most pressure, responsible for holding together impoverished factions recently at war facing a fierce winter and a terrifying threat from beyond the wall? <em>Especially</em> considering it appears to be part of yet another elaborate plan by the creepiest man in Winterfell (if it was reverse psychology on his part and this is the outcome he actually wanted, she's not yet smart enough to see through it).</p>

<p>She's finally got a roof and a warm bed, people around her she can trust, and meat and mead to share with them and a table to share it from. She's happy, for the first time since Season 1 (apart from nagging worries about that aforementioned Creepiest Man in Winterfell).</p>

<hr>

<p>Of course, she does now have this wrathful and impatient side to her personality. It would be perfectly in character if, next season, she took a ""backseat driver"" roll, constantly feeling the need to intervene every time she sees the less politically astute Jon about to do something she thinks is foolish or weak (a little like she did before the battle). But there's nothing we've seen in her character to suggest she actually wants to sit <em>behind</em> the wheel herself. </p>

<p>In season 7:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> This is pretty much exactly what happens. She can't stop arguing with almost every decision Jon makes, even directly contradicting him in front of his bannerman - but is aghast when he decides to leave and put her in charge. Then she finds herself conflicted: she reluctantly finds she's good at playing Lady of Winterfell, and somewhat enjoys the power, but hates dealing with the delicate, dangerous and stressful political balancing she has to do (until, with some help, she has it neatly disposed of...)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Much like Qyburn down south, it's much more convenient for her to let someone she knows she can influence take the personal risks. On that note...</p>

<h2>Fun bonus observation</h2>

<p>A recurring motif in both the books and the show is similar events happening to very different characters under very different circumstances.</p>

<p>In this episode, we get two scenes which, in some ways, are incredibly similar:</p>

<ul>
<li>An ashen-faced character is improbably proclaimed to be a monarch in the hall where they spent frustrating years sitting on the sidelines, in front of assembled lords and ladies. They might have idly fantasised about this, once, never thinking it possible, but they're not smiling, because of the tragic circumstances of how they came to be here and the challenge they now face.</li>
<li><a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/133037/can-cersei-lannister-claim-the-iron-throne-and-legitimize-her-act/133237#133237"">Both have claims to the throne that are shaky at best</a></li>
<li>By their side is an ally who is smiling. This person is in position to be the power behind the throne. They're smarter and shrewder than the person on the throne, and are happy to let them take the danger, pressure and responsibility.</li>
<li>The woman of the two makes uncomfortable eye-contact with a man hanging back behind the main crowd in the left hand side of the audience, with whom she has an uncertain, complicated relationship. They don't know if they can trust each other, and she doesn't know if he'll be a valuable ally or mortal threat.</li>
<li>In season 7:

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> There is a simmering power struggle between the woman and this man, which eventually explodes into an open conflict which ends with the woman ordering the man's execution (with very different levels of conviction and very different outcomes, see below...).</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>

<p>...while in some ways, the two scenes are almost polar opposites:</p>

<ul>
<li>One is in a rich and lavish hall, but it has an atmosphere of oppressive gloom. A gold and red palette is muted with dark shadows. The other is in an improverished war-torn hall, but it has an atmosphere of cheer and excitement. A grey palette is enlivened with bright daylight.</li>
<li>One desperately wanted to rule, the other tried to avoid it.</li>
<li>You don't need me to explain the differences in character between the monarchs Jon and Cersei, or the advisers Sansa and Qyburn... That sharp contrast is likely to be a major theme of the next season!</li>
<li>In season 7:

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> It was. Though Qyburn didn't have such a big role on screen - Cersei has remembered how to scheme unaided. <br/><br/>Also, regarding the two executions mentioned above: one executioner, in front of a supportive audience, knows when to carry out the execution without needing to be explicitly told to; the other, in a secretive private meeting, knows <em>not</em> to carry out the execution, <em>despite</em> being explicitly told to.</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
"
"134168","Why is Gregor ""The Mountain"" Clegane still a knight?","<p>In episode 6 of season 1, ""<em>A Golden Crown</em>"", the Hand of the King, Eddard Stark, declared Ser Gregor Clegane an outlaw and stripped him of basically everything, and sentenced him to death on top of that.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the first of his name, King of the Andals and the first men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I charge you to bring the King's justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes. I denounce him and attaint him. (gasps, murmurs, and voices of outrage sound at court) I strip him of all ranks and titles, of all lands and holdings, and sentence him to death.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It looked and sounded like a final decision. Why wasn't this order executed, even after Lord Beric Dondarrion failed? Just because one attempt didn't succeed, doesn't mean the sentence is called off, and yet later The Mountain is seen doing what he did previously. </p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><laws>","134172","<p>In practice, the reason is of course that <strong>he was still useful to the Lannisters</strong>, who hold King's Landing and the Iron Throne. Lord Tywin might allow his faithful dog to be killed for the sake of brokering an alliance with Dorne, but certainly not for the sake of honouring a decree made by one dead man on behalf of another, neither of whom had ever been very friendly towards House Lannister.</p>

<p>So how did they justify their decision to keep Gregor Clegane around, given that in theory they're continuing the succession from King Robert (even though in practice House Lannister essentially seized the throne from House Baratheon)? Well, the sentence might have been pronounced in the name of King Robert, but <strong>it was announced <em>by</em> Ned Stark, a man who shortly afterwards was executed for treason.</strong> The Lannister 'party line' is that Ned betrayed Robert by plotting to take the throne away from his son and heir. Given that, why should any announcements made by Ned, even supposedly in the name of the king, be considered valid? If challenged (and who would dare to challenge them?) the Lannisters could say something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Well, sure, the late Lord Stark wanted to strip Ser Gregor of his lands and titles. That was part of his plan to take the throne for himself, you see; he knew House Clegane's loyalty to the king, so from his point of view, Ser Gregor had to be eliminated so that his master plan to cheat Robert's children of the throne could go ahead.""</p>
</blockquote>
"
"134179","As things stand, will House Stark go extinct?","<p>According to the family tree in <em>A World of Ice and Fire</em> Ned Stark's children are in fact the only surviving Starks.
And as of S06E09;</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Bran is the only legitimate, male Stark.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the Season Six Finale it is revealed that;</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Jon is in fact the Son of Lyanna Stark and most likely, Rhaegar Targaryen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that if Jon was legitimised and there was record of his birth in the Citadel;</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> He would become a Targaryen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I guess my big question is: Can Bran father children? I find it to be quite an important issue considering House Stark's long term survival depends on it.</p>

<p>In season 4 (I can't remember which episode) Locke Bolton gives Bran a cut on the leg to confirm his identity. Bran reacts only with fear and not pain, indicating that he has no feeling below his waist.</p>

<p>Does this mean that he wouldn't be able to...get it up? And if so, why hasn't the show addressed House Stark's impending doom?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","134306","<h2>Can Bran sire children?</h2>

<p>House Stark is not doomed. Bran is the only surviving legitimate male Stark but he is probably unlikely to father children due to his disability. But he is not the only Stark alive.</p>

<p>Since some of our members seem to believe that Bran can have intercourse and that medical science in Planetos and our world are same, I'd like to quote Eddard Stark:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I dreamed of Bran,” Sansa had whispered to him. “I saw him smiling.”</p>
  
  <p>“He was going to be a knight,” Arya was saying now. “A knight of the
  Kingsguard. Can he still be a knight?”</p>
  
  <p>“No,” Ned said. He saw no use in lying to her. “Yet someday he may be
  the lord of a great holdfast and sit on the king’s council. He might
  raise castles like Brandon the Builder, or sail a ship across the
  Sunset Sea, or enter your mother’s Faith and become the High Septon.”
  But he will never run beside his wolf again, he thought with a sadness
  too deep for words, <strong>or lie with a woman, or hold his own son in his
  arms</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is the only mention of Bran's ability to procreate as far as I can recall. And his own father seems to believe that Bran can never lie with a woman aka have sex and he would never sire a child. </p>

<p>But I also have to add that I am not a medical expert to provide a definite ruling on the matter. I am only building on what the author has provided us with in the books. </p>

<p>In any case, Can Bran have children? Maybe, Maybe not. Do other characters in universe seem to think he will have children? No they don't. </p>

<h2>Other surviving Starks</h2>

<p>But despite all that, Bran has two legitimate sisters; Sansa Stark and Arya Stark. Arya is still too young but Sansa is of age to bear children. Any children Arya and Sansa may bear can carry the Stark name and inherit the North from their uncle Brandon Stark. Any man they might marry can also take Stark name and the children born out of such union will be just as much Stark as children of a male Stark.</p>

<p>Also in the books, Rickon is still alive and is therefore heir to Bran.</p>

<h2>Precedence for female line</h2>

<p>There is precedence for female line furthering a great House. </p>

<p>This is not the first time for House Stark to look to female line for survival if Wildlings can be believed. Lord <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Brandon_Stark_(the_daughterless)"" rel=""noreferrer"">Brandon Stark</a> fathered no children except a daughter. The daughter was supposedly abducted by King Beyond the Wall, <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bael_the_Bard"" rel=""noreferrer"">Bael the Bard</a>. Brandon was distraught because this meant extinction of House Stark. But later the girl was found with a child fathered by Bael. That child was brought up as a Stark and succeeded his grandfather upon his death. </p>

<p>House Lannister was once in a similar dilemma. King <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Gerold_III_Lannister"" rel=""noreferrer"">Gerold III Lannister</a> died without a male issue. He had only one daughter and she was married to a Knight named <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Joffrey_Lannister"" rel=""noreferrer"">Joffrey Lydden</a>. Upon King Gerold's death, Ser Joffrey was crowned as King of the Rock by council of Westerlander nobility and he took the name Lannister due to his marriage to the Princess of the Rock. He ascended to the throne as King Joffrey I Lannister. Current Lannisters are descended from King Joffrey and daughter of King Gerold, no one considers them to be ""not real Lannisters"". </p>

<p>Another example is given in succession crisis of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Hornwood"" rel=""noreferrer"">House Hornwood</a><sup>*</sup>. Lord <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Halys_Hornwood"" rel=""noreferrer"">Halys Hornwood</a> died in <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_on_the_Green_Fork"" rel=""noreferrer"">battle against Tywin Lannister</a>. His only legitimate child <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daryn_Hornwood"" rel=""noreferrer"">Daryn Hornwood</a> died in <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_in_the_Whispering_Wood"" rel=""noreferrer"">battle against Jaime Lannister</a>. The considered candidates to carry on Hornwood names were:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Larence_Snow"" rel=""noreferrer"">Larence Snow</a> - A bastard son of Lord Halys Hornwood. He could be legitimized by King in the North to be the next Lord Hornwood. </li>
<li><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Beren_Tallhart"" rel=""noreferrer"">Beren Tallhart</a> -  Younger son of Lord Halys' sister, Berena Hornwood. <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Leobald_Tallhart"" rel=""noreferrer"">His father</a> offered that Beren would take Hornwood name if he was to be named heir of Halys Hornwood. </li>
</ol>

<p>Another example is kindly reminded by <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/users/24024/broklynite"">Broklynite</a>. Lady <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Maege_Mormont"" rel=""noreferrer"">Maege Mormont</a>'s children carry the Mormont name. It is unclear who is the father of those kids. When Maege's brother Jeor Mormont abdicated his seat and took the black, Jeor's son Jorah Mormont became Lord of Bear Island. Jorah then went into exile without siring any kids so Maege Mormont became lady of Bear Island. Her children are considered Mormonts. (But this would be a weak example because we do not know who is her husband. If he is/was a Mormont as well, this example won't hold). </p>

<p>So even if Lords of the North refuse to have Sansa as their Queen like Lords of Westerlands refused to have King Gerold's daughter as their Queen, Sansa's husband can instead be crowned as King in the North (Now you know why Petyr Baelish was so eager to marry Sansa) if he takes the Stark name just like Joffrey Lydden. </p>

<p><sub>* The Succession crisis of House Hornwood never occurred in the show.</sub></p>

<h2>Who can take Stark name?</h2>

<p>By law, a man can only take Stark name:</p>

<ol>
<li>By right of marriage to a Stark woman</li>
<li>By right of descent from a Stark woman</li>
<li>By grant of legitimization decree for removal of bastardy taint from the King provided he is a bastard of a Stark man or woman.</li>
<li>By right of birth to a Stark man in wedlock (The normal way)</li>
</ol>

<p>There is no other way or precedent to be a Stark. So Arya, Jon and Sansa all have equal potential to further the Stark line even if Bran cannot.</p>

<h2>Why show hasn't showed that potential succession crisis?</h2>

<p>Because there is no succession crisis. if Bran comes back to take his place as King in the North as eldest surviving son of Eddard Stark and reveals that Jon is not a Stark, House Stark is still not doomed. Even if Bran fathers no children, Sansa stands as his heir. Whoever marries Sansa can take the Stark name for himself and the children of that man and Sansa will be named Starks. Even Jon can take Stark name if he wishes due to his descent from sister of Lord Eddard Stark if Bran legitimizes him (Ironically, Jon would then also be able to take Targaryen name, not just Stark name). </p>

"134261","Does the Vale have a merchant marine?","<p>As per the wikia entry for <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/The_Vale_of_Arryn"" rel=""nofollow"">the Vale</a> the more the temperature drops, less accessible it becomes. And, <em>winter is coming</em>. So, is there a fleet of ships based in the Vale that normally sails to Essos and southern Westeros for trading purposes? And come winter, that merchant marine will become the primary means of getting food, etc. into the Vale? Or, are not many ships based in the Vale and the Vale relies on traders to sail their ships to the Vale?</p>

<p>The Vale assets are critical for the Northern campaign. Yet they are at dire risk of getting snowed-in soon enough... right?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","134309","<h2>Inaccessibility of Vale</h2>

<p>Vale is separated from mainland Westeros by a mountain range called <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Mountains_of_the_Moon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mountains of the Moon</a>. The hold of House Arryn on the mountains is contested by <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Vale_mountain_clans"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Clans of Mountain</a> who reject authority of Arryns to rule them. To connect Vale with rest of the Westeros, there is a road running in the Mountains which is called <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/High_road"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the High Road</a>. This road leads to a pass on which castle of <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Bloody_Gate"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bloody Gate</a> guards entry into Vale proper. Since the High Road runs on the Mountains, its availability is subject to weather. In Winter, it is closed to heavy snowing, thus blocking the only land route to Vale. You can see the terrain in the map below:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NfdGA.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/NfdGA.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<h2>Fertility of Vale of Arryn</h2>

<p>The Valley of the Vale is famously fertile. It is a tranquil land of wide rivers and hundreds of lakes. Wheat, corn, barley, pumpkins, and fruit grow in its fertile soil. Vale of Arryn is independent in production of food. Even Highgarden cannot match the quality and numbers of Vale's food production. </p>

<h2>Untouched Harvest</h2>

<p>Vale did not take any part in the War of the five Kings therefore it did not have to suffer the dire impacts and losses as other regions did. Riverlands were burnt by both Lannisters and Starks, destroying their crops and harvest. Westerlands were burnt by Starks. Crownlands also saw ravaging at hands of the Northmen. To sum it all up, most regions lost their harvests as a result of war except the Vale and the Reach. Dorne is also untouched by war. In any case, due to their neutrality, Vale did not suffer wide scale burning and pillaging. It is a tradition in Westeros to set aside food for Winter when harvest is not possible. Therefore, in all likelihood, Vale has ample stores for coming Winter. </p>

<h2>Naval arm of Vale</h2>

<p>All the great Houses traditionally maintain a naval fleet. Starks had one as well but it was burnt by <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Brandon_Stark_(Burner)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Brandon the Burner</a>. After that Starks never formed their naval arm. </p>

<p>In any case, we have heard about Navy of Vale although not in current timeline. During North-Vale war before the conquest, Arryn and Stark navies <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/War_Across_the_Water"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">clashed against each other</a>. Later, during Aegon's conquest, Arryn Navy <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Battle_in_the_waters_off_Gulltown"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">thwarted Targaryen naval attempt</a> to seize Gulltown, although they got destroyed themselves by Visenya Targaryen and her dragon Vhagar. </p>

<p>It is not clear whether Arryns formed a navy after that or not but it is very likely. </p>

<h2>Gulltown</h2>

<p><a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Gulltown"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gulltown</a> is one of the greatest ports in the realm. It lies strategically on trade route from Braavos to Kingslanding. Therefore many ships traveling to and from Essos anchor in Gulltown to take supplies and for trade. It is the largest city in the Vale. </p>

<p>Petyr Baelish said this about the port:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""... Gulltown, the Vale's greatest port.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Gulltown"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AFFC Chapter 41</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Its strategic location means it never lacks for trade in many of the
  exotic goods making their way from across the narrow sea, <strong>keeping
  the Vale supplied even when the passes of the Mountains of the Moon
  are closed in winter</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it would make sense that given the importance of the city to Vale, House Arryn would maintain a naval fleet there for both trade and security. Even if House Arryn itself does not do that, the ruling <a href=""http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Grafton"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">House Grafton</a> would maintain a fleet there just like Manderlys maintain a fleet a White Harbour, Redwynes maintain a fleet at their port etc.</p>

<p>So in all probability, when the mountain passes are closed due to snow, Vale would be able to ferry supplies and men across the Bite into the North. It must be noted however that Baelish supported North because he hoped to marry Sansa. Now that Sansa has spurned Baelish, it is unclear whether the alliance between North and Vale continue. </p>

<p>But if you are looking for a Canon answer, not informed speculation, the answer would be <strong>We do not know if Vale has a merchant navy from Canon sources</strong>.</p>

The number of cities he razes, his personal wealth, the number of horses in his herds, the size of the Khalasar surrounding him, they all indicate his strength and victories.

<p>Am I just over-interpreting things here, or does he speak of someone completely different?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","134317","<p>He is talking about Jon. </p>

<p>Jon was born somewhere in South (We know it is Dorne but most people do not). </p>

<p>Eddard Stark went to war against King Aerys Targaryen with Robert Baratheon, Jon Arryn and Hoster Tully. The war was fought in South. When Eddard came back from war, he had Jon with him which made it clear for every one that Jon was born in South. </p>

<p>Jon is a bastard whose mother is unknown to most people. Therefore, Jon is the motherless bastard born in South while Sansa is the trueborn daughter born in Winterfell.</p>

<p>Also, Littlefinger could not possibly know about true parentage of Jon. Only two people knew of it; Lord Howland Reed and Lord Eddard Stark. And Eddard had openly declared Jon to be his son in front of the whole realm so that's what Littlefinger knows as well. This is proved by Baelish's conversation with Sansa in S06E05:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Baelish: The time may come when you need an army loyal to you. </p>
  
  <p>Sansa: I have an army. </p>
  
  <p>Baelish: <strong>Your brother's army. Half-brother.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it is proven that Baelish thinks Jon is Sansa's half brother. </p>

<p>This ""born in south"" dialogue is an absurd innovation of show. Robb Stark was also born in Riverrun which is situated in South, not North.</p>

Since records aren't kept for all hatchlings, we only have records of dragons which grew up a bit. Many hatchlings died in infancy and have no record. Many hatchlings were eaten by other dragons. So following would account only for known dragons:</p>

<pre><code>╔═════════════╦═══════════════════╗

║ Aegon I     ║ 3                 ║

"134624","How do dragons cross the sea?","<p>In season 6 finale, Queen Daenerys Targaryen brought her entire fleet to Westeros. </p>

<p>We saw the dragons flapping around the ships. They must be a few tons in weight by then and none of the ships was big enough for them to land on. The biggest was carrying the Queen, and it was just an average size ship.</p>

<p>So how do Dragons cross the sea? Can they maintain a several weeks flight without rest?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><dragons>","134746","<p><code>&lt;nerd rant&gt;</code></p>

<p>The answer to this question is basically four parts: <em>(1)</em> size of the straight in question, <em>(2)</em> the starting point of the voyage and <em>(3)</em> route taken, and <em>(4)</em> the speed of the ships. Let's look at all of these. <a href=""http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season-6/episode-10/map/location/77/bay-of-dragons"" rel=""nofollow"">Please reference this map for details</a> on the answers given. </p>

<ol>
<li>There is not any proper distance given (that I know of) so we can assume a long or short distance at will. I personally don't like this one either, but it stands.</li>
<li>On the provided map you will see that on the starting point <em>Bay of Dragons</em> (formerly <em>Slavers' Bay</em>) is on the south side of the continent so there will be some time of sailing near the mainland, giving the dragons opportunity to rest as needed.</li>
<li>If you notice on the map above, there is a chain of small islands between the closest points (Sunspear and Lys) to the south. So the dragons would not even need to fly the whole trip at once. </li>
<li>Ships of this type would be extremely slow compared to the quick flight of a dragon. If we want to be overly generous about the ships used and say that they could move at the speed of a Caravel, that is still only an <a href=""http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~vaucher/History/Ships_Discovery/"" rel=""nofollow"">average of 4 knots</a>, so a several weeks - months trip via ship would be much shorter; days or less. If we assume a meager 45 MPH (72.4 km/h) for the dragons it would take a ship 10 hours to travel what a dragon would in 1. So even if we put a distance between the two continents at 350 miles (563 km) a dragon would make the trip in 8 hours and still have time to stop for coffee on the way, the fleet would on the other hand needs 76 hours, and that's with favorable weather. </li>

<h2>Score List of Dragonriders</h2>
<p>The Dragonriders who managed to score a kill or more during the war were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prince <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aemond_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Aemond Targaryen</strong></a>: Prince Aemond killed his nephew Prince <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Lucerys_Velaryon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lucerys Velaryon</a> and Lucerys' dragon in battle above Storm's End, winning the first aerial victory of the war and second ever in Westerosi history. Later he joined forces with his brother King <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon_II_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Aegon II</a> to kill their cousin Princess <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rhaenys_Targaryen_(daughter_of_Aemon)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Rhaenys Targaryen</a> and her dragon. In his final battle, the Prince faced his uncle Prince <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daemon_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Daemon Targaryen</a>. Aemond and Daemon both died in the battle that ensured above God's Eye. That makes his total tally <strong>3</strong>.</li>
<li>King <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon_II_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Aegon II Targaryen</strong></a>: Aegon II was the leader of Green Faction of House Targaryen and eldest living son of King <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Viserys_I_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Viserys I</a> when his father died. His first kill came from his battle against Princess <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Rhaenys_Targaryen_(daughter_of_Aemon)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Rhaenys Targaryen</a> which he shared with his brother Aemond. Later the King and his dragon killed a wild dragon named Grey Ghost on Dragonstone. During his conquest of Dragonstone, Aegon faced his cousin <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Baela_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Baela Targaryen</a>. He successfully killed Baela's dragon and took her captive. His own legs however shattered in the fight and his dragon succumbed to his wounds a few weeks later. That makes his total score <strong>3</strong>, putting him in a tie with his brother Aemond for the top position.</li>
<li>Ser <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Addam_Velaryon"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Addam Velaryon</strong></a>: The loyal servant of Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen and heir to Lord Corlys Velaryon, Ser Addam and his dragon killed Vermithor in Tumbleton with help of Tessarion. Ser Addam however did not survive the battle and died as well. His score remains <strong>1</strong> for shared (posthumous) victory against Vermithor.</li>
<li>Prince <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daemon_Targaryen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Daemon Targaryen</strong></a>: The man known as the rogue Prince made his sole kill in battle against his nephew Aemond. He launched a suicide attack when faced with desperate odds against World's largest Dragon Vhagar. He managed to kill his nephew and Vhagar but he died as well due to the fall. His corpse was never found in the lake of God's Eye. His score is <strong>1</strong> but his 1 kill is Vhagar so he virtually wins.</li>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Prince Daeron and Hard Hugh Hammer don't have any kills to their names because their dragons won their kill points while being riderless. Also it must be noted that Queen Jaehaera Targaryen and her brother Jaehaerys were not technically dragon riders. They were bonded to the dragons but they never actually rode them. They are in the list just for the sake of completion.</p>

"134649","To what extent does Jon Snow have abilities as a Warg","<p>In <em>A Clash of Kings</em>, we witness Jon warging into Ghost and getting attacked by the eagle. As far as I can recall, he doesn't warg in the show after that point. </p>

<p>My questions are the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is Jon aware of his ability as a warg? I've read that all Stark children possessed the ability, such as Arya with Nymeria. </li>
<li>If Jon is a warg, would that mean Bran as the Three Eyed Raven could possibly Warg (time travel?) with Jon and show him the scene of the reveal of his parentage? Or does that ability lie with the Greenseers like the Three Eyed Raven?</li>
</ol>

<p>With regards to the related question, I was more asking on whether Jon was aware that he was able to warg, not whether he was able to control or choose what he wargs into, although the latter ties into the former.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><jon-snow>","134650","<h2>Jon's Capability</h2>

<p>All Stark Children show the gift of Skin Changing <a href=""http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Quite_a_Few_Questions"" rel=""noreferrer"">as GRRM confirmed</a>. </p>

<p>Jon and Bran are described as particularly powerful Skinchangers. Bran is even more special because he is the Winged-wolf while his siblings aren't. </p>

<p>Jon has shown his abilities (Unintentionally) as a warg on following occasions:</p>

<ol>
<li>In controlling his wolf. There is no such thing as a tame direwolf. </li>
<li>Spying on Wildling Army in Frost Fangs while on a ranging with Qhorin Halfhand. Jon was asleep and Ghost was miles away, yet Jon managed to slip into the skin of his wolf and see what was waiting ahead of them.</li>
<li>He slipped into Ghost's skin after the Battle of Castle Black when he was standing beyond the wall and Ghost came back from the wild.</li>
</ol>

<p>Jon warged into his wolf to scout the Wildling army albeit unintentionally. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And suddenly <strong>he was back in the mountains, his paws sunk deep in a
  drift of snow as he stood upon the edge of a great precipice</strong>. Before
  him the Skirling Pass opened up into airy emptiness, and a long
  vee-shaped valley lay spread beneath him like a quilt, awash in all
  the colors of an autumn afternoon.</p>
  
  <p>A vast blue-white wall plugged one end of the vale, squeezing between
  the mountains as if it had shouldered them aside, and for a moment he
  thought he had dreamed himself back to Castle Black. Then he realized
  he was looking at a river of ice several thousand feet high. Under
  that glittering cold cliff was a great lake, its deep cobalt waters
  reflecting the snowcapped peaks that ringed it. <strong>There were men down
  in the valley, he saw now; many men, thousands, a huge host</strong>.<br>
  <sub> <em>A Clash Of Kings: Chapter 53</em> </sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jon's comrades when scouting the Skirling Pass were the first to realize Jon was a warg after he told them about his ""dream"".</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It made him feel half a fool to talk of such things to Qhorin and the
  other rangers, but he did as he was commanded. None of the black
  brothers laughed at him, however. By the time he was done, even Squire
  Dalbridge was no longer smiling.</p>
  
  <p><strong>“Skinchanger?” said Ebben grimly</strong>, looking at the Halfhand. Does he mean the eagle? Jon wondered. Or me? Skinchangers and wargs belonged
  in Old Nan’s stories, not in the world he had lived in all his life.
  Yet here, in this strange bleak wilderness of rock and ice, it was not
  hard to believe.</p>
  
  <p>“The cold winds are rising. Mormont feared as much. Benjen Stark felt
  it as well. Dead men walk and the trees have eyes again. <strong>Why should
  we balk at wargs and giants?</strong>”<br>
  <sub> <em>A Clash Of Kings: Chapter 53</em> </sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later Jon accepted it as well and started to understand it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>it was a hunger inside him, sharp as a dragonglass blade. A hunger...
  he could feel it. <strong>It was food he needed, prey, a red deer that stank
  of fear or a great elk proud and defiant. He needed to kill and fill
  his belly with fresh meat and hot dark blood. His mouth began to water
  with the thought</strong>.</p>
  
  <p><strong>It was a long moment before he understood what was happening. When he did, he bolted to his feet. “Ghost?”</strong> He turned toward the wood,
  and there he came, padding silently out of the green dusk, the breath
  coming warm and white from his open jaws. “Ghost!” he shouted, and the
  direwolf broke into a run.<br>
  <sub> <em>A Storm Of Swords: Chapter 79</em></sub></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2>Is Jon aware of his power?</h2>

<p>Jon is aware that he is a Warg. He was told that by the Wildlings when he went beyond the Wall with the Old Bear and the rest of the Night's Watch on the Great Ranging. Later he was taunted as ""Beast boy"" and ""Warg"" by Night's Watch Men who wished him ill. But Jon is untrained in the art, unlike Bran who is trained by the Three Eyed Raven himself. </p>

<p>Not only did Jon know it, the Wildings knew it, many people in the Watch knew it and so do some Northern aristocrats such as Cregan Karstark:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cregan: I see what you are, Snow. <strong>Half a wolf and half a wildling,
  baseborn get of a traitor and a whore</strong>. You would deliver a highborn
  maid to the bed of some stinking savage. Did you sample her yourself
  first? If you mean to kill me, do it and be damned for a kinslayer.
  Stark and Karstark are one blood.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Jon notes in ASOS, Men of the NW call him a warg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“What everyone knows is that Ser Alliser is a knight from a noble
  line, and trueborn, while I’m the bastard who killed Qhorin Halfhand
  and bedded with a spearwife. <strong>The warg, I’ve heard them call me</strong>.
  How can I be a warg without a wolf, I ask you?” His mouth twisted. “I
  don’t even dream of Ghost anymore. All my dreams are of the crypts, of
  the stone kings on their thrones.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, Janos Slynt declared him for a Warg in front of everyone in the Night's Watch elections for the new Lord Commander.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lord Janos started sputtering again. “This, this is an outrage. We
  ought to hang this boy. <strong>Yes! Hang him, I say, hang him for a
  turncloak and a warg</strong>, along with his friend Mance Rayder. Lord
  Commander? I will not have it, I will not suffer it!”<br>
  <sub> <em>A Storm Of Swords</em> </sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Slynt also said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lord Janos was red-faced and quivering. “The beast,” he gasped. “Look!
  The beast that tore the life from Halfhand. <strong>A warg walks among us,
  brothers. A WARG!</strong> This... this creature is not fit to lead us! This
  beastling is not fit to live!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wildling Skinchanger, Varamyr, knew it as well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He had known what Snow was the moment he saw that great white direwolf
  stalking silent at his side. <strong>One skinchanger can always sense
  another</strong>. Mance should have let me take the direwolf. There would be
  a second life worthy of a king. He could have done it, he did not
  doubt. The gift was strong in Snow, but the youth was untaught, still
  fighting his nature when he should have gloried in it.<br>
  <sub> <em>A Dance With Dragons: Prologue</em> </sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wildlings who saw Jon kill Qhorin also said this in front of him:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“<strong>The lad’s a warg, or close enough</strong>,” put in Ragwyle, the big
  spearwife. “His wolf took a piece o’ Halfhand’s leg.”</p>
  
  <p>The Weeper’s red rheumy eyes gave Jon another look. “Aye? Well, he has
  a wolfish cast to him, now as I look close. Bring him to Mance, might
  be he’ll keep him.” He wheeled his horse around and galloped off, his
  riders hard behind him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later Rattleshirt said this in front of Jon and the council of Wildling chiefs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The black bastard what gutted Orell,” said Rattleshirt, “<strong>and a
  bloody warg as well.</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h2>Can Bran take Jon with him?</h2>

<p>Difference between Bran and Jon is that Jon is a skinchanger but Bran is a Greenseer. The Three Eyed Raven chose him as his successor and the Children of The Forest hinted that they were waiting for Bran for a long time. Which means Bran is either some sort of a prophesied Messiah or he is exceptionally talented. While we have seen that two Greenseers can tag along in visions but it has never been disclosed if a Greenseer can take a normal human or a common warg with him in visions. </p>
"
"134678","Is Sansa and Tyrion's marriage still legitimate?","<p>As of the end of Season 6 of Game of Thrones, it seems very likely that Daenerys and her fleet/army will, at some point, come into contact with Jon Snow and the North.  It's entirely possible that they'll become allies - they both want the Lannisters removed from power, and they have a mutual friend in Theon Greyjoy.</p>

<p>As Daenerys said, ""The best way to make alliances is with marriage.""  I know there's been a lot of speculation about a possible marriage between</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Daenerys and Jon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what about the fact that Daenerys's Hand of the Queen has already been married to Jon's sister?  And the relationship between Tyrion and Sansa, while not exactly loving, was better than how Tyrion and Shae's time ended, and certainly went better than Sansa and Ramsay's marriage.  So the two of them might be amenable to the idea of marrying for the sake of their respective factions.</p>

<p>But a lot has happened since then - Sansa was married to Ramsay, and Tyrion was convicted of murdering his nephew and fled the kingdom after killing his father.  And the lords of the north might not be so keen to kneel to a Lannister.  If the marriage is no longer seen as legitimate by the populace then it would defeat the purpose of sealing the alliance.</p>

<p>So my question is: <strong>Assuming Sansa and Tyrion want to resume their marriage, is there any law, custom, or precedent in Westeros that could prevent them from doing so?</strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","134691","<p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href=""http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Marriage"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wiki of course, where else would we get our knowledge?</a></p>

<h3>The Books</h3>

<p>The Wikia page states that a marriage can be annulled if it is not consummated, this can only happen by request and must be approved by The High Septon <strong>or</strong> A Council of Faith.</p>

<p>That means that a marriage is not automatically invalid if not consummated.</p>

<h3>The TV series</h3>

<p>In the TV series it is stated many times that the marriage between Sansa and Tyrion is not legit because they did not consummate it. Most of the times this is said by the people who want to marry Sansa to someone else or benefit from their lack of marriage.</p>

<p><strong>If</strong> the TV series would follow the rules of marriage of the books, then Sansa's marriage to Ramsey would not be legitimate but her marriage to Tyrion could be.</p>

<p>The information of how an annulment would work could be kept as a plot twist for when the 2 characters meet again.</p>

<p><strong>Or</strong> the TV series has already given us all the information about marriages and thus not consummating the wedding automatically annuls it, if we are to believe what has been said by (for example) Littlefinger.</p>

<p>In that case, Sansa is now a widow.</p>

<h3>Extra</h3>

<p>The wikia also states that women, who are forced to marry while being a hostage (not to be confused with simply being forced by their parents) can also ask for an annulment.</p>

<p>So Sansa could still ask for an annulment because she was forced to marry Tyrion.</p>

<p>Throughout the series, Cersei has often been wrongly blamed for various murders:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">

 * She was initially blamed for killing Robert's bastards, but that turned out to be Joffrey's doing<br>
 * She had never intended for Ned to be killed, only for him to be sent to the wall<br>
 * Jaimie is the one who pushes Bran out the window, not Cersei<br>

<p>Some people say that Cersei Lannister is the heir of Tommen - if you go all the way up the Baratheon family tree, you will find Cersei’s great-great-great-great-grandfather, Mathin Lannister, but isn’t this claim weaker than Daenerys's claim?</p>

","<game-of-thrones>","134963","<p><em>If</em> our understanding of Westerosi inheritance is correct, then Cersei has a stronger claim than Dany, because the line of succession never follows marriages, only blood relations. So, for example, the fact that Tommen's great grandfather married a Targaryen does <em>not</em> put anyone on the Targaryen side of the family into the Baratheon line of succession. Cersei is probably not <em>the strongest</em> claimant -- we'd have to follow the male lineages at every tier of the family tree and confirm that they're all dead, but if she's the first still-living descendant on one of Tommen's male ancestral blood lines, that's a valid claim, while Dany's is not. </p>

<p>There is also the fact that any claim Cersei could make, in theory, Jaime could also make, since they are twins. And under Westerosi law, male heirs always dominate, so his is stronger. It's unclear what his oaths as Kingsguard may or may not have done to such a claim.</p>

<p>Of course, the question is really just a pointless technicality, because:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you consider the Targaryens the legitimate royal family, Dany's claim is by far stronger than Cersei's because she's the last living child of the last King.</li>
<li>Cersei <em>has the throne</em> through the simple fact that no one else is alive to contest it, and she has control over the military. No one else's claim is even remotely strong enough to convince people to back theirs over Cersei's.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the end, the strongest claim to the throne will go to whichever manages to murder the other first.</p>

"135013","Which speaking roles on Game of Thrones are played by non-European actors?","<p>It is well known that most of the <em>Game of Thrones</em> cast is European. By European, I count people that have at least one nationality being inside Europe in the large meaning (so I don't restrict to EU).

<li>Must have no European nationality: for instance, if an actor is both English and American, he's considered European; Iceland is not part of the EU, but still part of Europe, so Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson is also considered as European.</li>
<li>Must have a distinctively speaking role. This question doesn't include actors who do not speak on screen unless the role is named, at least minor and meant to be silent; also people only shouting in unison shouldn't make the list.</li>

"201918","Ghost as a Foreshadowing of Jon Snow's Lineage","<p>I was watching the first GoT episode and I remember reading or hearing somewhere that the scene in the forest with the dead stag and direwolf is a foreshadowing device used by the writers.  I know that Jon mentions that the 5 direwolf pups can represent the 5 stark children.  But then Jon finds the albino direwolf.  Considering the white fur, is this foreshadowing of Jon's true lineage?  Is there any proof that this is what Martin or Weiss/Benioff intended?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><jon-snow>","202027","<h1>Possibly, though only with broad strokes to signify Jon is different.</h1>

<p>The dead direwolf and the pups forms part of a foreshadowing for the whole of book 1/season 1 in that Ned going down south will ultimately kill him. An antler killed the direwolf and we know a the direwolf is of House Stark and the stag of House Baratheon. It even worries Catelyn in universe when she thinks of the signs this sends.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It took Ned a moment to comprehend her words, but when the understanding came, the darkness left his eyes. ""Robert is coming here?"" When she nodded, a smile broke across his face.</p>
  
  <p>Catelyn wished she could share his joy. But she had heard the talk in the yards; a direwolf dead in the snow, a broken antler in its throat. Dread coiled within her like a snake, but she forced herself to smile at this man she loved, this man who put no faith in signs. ""I knew that would please you,"" she said. ""We should send word to your brother on the Wall.""</p>
  
  <p><sub><em>A Game of Thrones</em>, Catelyn I</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, there is some significance to Ghost compared to the rest of the group, it is meant to show Jon as an outsider, the bastard <strong>Snow</strong> and not a Stark. Ghost is found away from the others having been shunned away and of course has white ""snowy"" fur.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""There,"" Jon said. He swung his horse around and galloped back across the bridge. They watched him dismount where the direwolf lay dead in the snow, watched him kneel. A moment later he was riding back to them, smiling.</p>
  
  <p>""He must have crawled away from the others,"" Jon said.</p>
  
  <p>""Or been driven away,"" their father said, looking at the sixth pup. His fur was white, where the rest of the litter was grey. His eyes were as red as the blood of the ragged man who had died that morning. Bran thought it curious that this pup alone would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind.</p>
  
  <p>""An albino,"" Theon Greyjoy said with wry amusement. ""This one will die even faster than the others.""</p>
  
  <p>Jon Snow gave his father's ward a long, chilling look. ""I think not, Greyjoy,"" he said. ""This one belongs to me.""</p>
  
  <p><sub><em>A Game of Thrones</em>, Bran I</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course the Stark banner is of a grey direwolf, which all the main Stark's direwolves were, so this is again to show the Jon is different. I don't think it is in anyway to give a hint of who he really is just that he's not quite a Stark. Of course, as noted by Bran, there is some significance to Ghost having already opened his eyes but I'm not quite 100% sure what this could be signifying.</p>

<p>Just to note that there were 5 direwolf pups initially found 3 male and 2 female as there are 3 male and 2 female trueborn children of Ned and Catelyn and so there is significance to the pups themselves. Which, as previously mentioned, translates to Ghost being separated and different from the rest, as Jon is.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Lord Stark,"" Jon said. It was strange to hear him call Father that, so formal. Bran looked at him with desperate hope. ""There are five pups,"" he told Father. ""Three male, two female.""</p>
  
  <p>""What of it, Jon?""</p>
  
  <p>""You have five trueborn children,"" Jon said. ""Three sons, two daughters. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord.""</p>
  
  <p>Bran saw his father's face change, saw the other men exchange glances. He loved Jon with all his heart at that moment. Even at seven, Bran understood what his brother had done. The count had come right only because Jon had omitted himself. He had included the girls, included even Rickon, the baby, but not the bastard who bore the surname Snow, the name that custom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own.</p>
  
  <p><sub><em>A Game of Thrones</em>, Bran I</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's also worth noting Ned's words earlier about Ghost ""Or been driven away"". It could be that the mother drove Ghost away from the others as she lay dying just as Cat had been driving Jon away for a long time because he is ""different"".</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""What of Jon Snow, my lord?"" Maester Luwin asked.</p>
  
  <p>Catelyn tensed at the mention of the name. Ned felt the anger in her, and pulled away.</p>
  
  <p>Many men fathered bastards. Catelyn had grown up with that knowledge. It came as no surprise to her, in the first year of her marriage, to learn that Ned had fathered a child on some girl chance met on campaign. He had a man's needs, after all, and they had spent that year apart, Ned off at war in the south while she remained safe in her father's castle at Riverrun. Her thoughts were more of Robb, the infant at her breast, than of the husband she scarcely knew. He was welcome to whatever solace he might find between battles. And if his seed quickened, she expected he would see to the child's needs.</p>
  
  <p>He did more than that. The Starks were not like other men. Ned brought his bastard home with him, and called him ""son"" for all the north to see. When the wars were over at last, and Catelyn rode to Winterfell, Jon and his wet nurse had already taken up residence.
  That cut deep. Ned would not speak of the mother, not so much as a word, but a castle has no secrets, and Catelyn heard her maids repeating tales they heard from the lips of her husband's soldiers. They whispered of Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, deadliest of the seven knights of Aerys's Kingsguard, and of how their young lord had slain him in single combat. And they told how afterward Ned had carried Ser Arthur's sword back to the beautiful young sister who awaited him in a castle called Starfall on the shores of the Summer Sea. The Lady Ashara Dayne, tall and fair, with haunting violet eyes. It had taken her a fortnight to marshal her courage, but finally, in bed one night, Catelyn had asked her husband the truth of it, asked him to his face.</p>
  
  <p>That was the only time in all their years that Ned had ever frightened her. ""Never ask me about Jon,"" he said, cold as ice. ""He is my blood, and that is all you need to know. And now I will learn where you heard that name, my lady."" She had pledged to obey; she told him; and from that day on, the whispering had stopped, and Ashara Dayne's name was never heard in Winterfell again.</p>
  
  <p>Whoever Jon's mother had been, Ned must have loved her fiercely, for nothing Catelyn said would persuade him to send the boy away. It was the one thing she could never forgive him. She had come to love her husband with all her heart, but she had never found it in her to love Jon. She might have overlooked a dozen bastards for Ned's sake, so long as they were out of sight. Jon was never out of sight, and as he grew, he looked more like Ned than any of the trueborn sons she bore him. Somehow that made it worse. ""Jon must go,"" she said now.</p>
  
  <p><sub><em>A Game of Thrones</em>, Catelyn II</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Lastly, it is worth noting that George R. R. Martin employs a three step foreshadowing process and this is almost certainly the first step in that process that something is different with Jon. As such it is only signifying something is different with Jon through very general broad strokes rather than pointing to where he possibly came from.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Q: Anne, although you're the envy of many a GRRM fan, do you ever wish you didn't have to edit the books so that you could be surprised by them all at once along with the rest of us?</p>
  
  <p>A: No. As above, he doesn’t tell me a lot. He feels I am most effective at my job if I am surprised along with everyone else. And it is easier to tell when he’s overplaying a hand and revealing things too early if you don’t actually know going in what will happen. <strong>That said, now that I’ve realized his three-fold revelation strategy, I see it in play almost every time. The first, subtle hint for the really astute readers, followed later by the more blatant hint for the less attentive, followed by just spelling it out for everyone else.</strong> It’s a brilliant strategy, and highly effective.</p>

"135356","Elite troops and Single Combat in Westeros","<p>We know personal skills are not that important in a medieval battle. Discipline was one of the two crucial aspects of almost all medieval battles, the other being numbers. In fact, this is something Stannis acknowledges as well.</p>

<p>Romans usually tried to withdraw and regroup when they lost formation. Their formation, a.k.a, discipline enabled them to conquer 60% of the known world.</p>

<p>Of course, there are many exceptions. I bet the most classical example is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Keresztes"" rel=""nofollow"">Battle of Keresztes</a>, where the Crusader army routed the Ottoman army but repelled by the military logistics group, i.e., cooks, pages etc.</p>

<p>In this era, there are so many fabled elite units, famous for their discipline. The obvious example is Polish Hussars, while Swiss Armored Pikemen are just a little behind. If we intend to extend the list, Janissaries, Tercio Pikemen, Varangian Guards and Catapracts would come next. These elite troops were to rally routing troops, keep formation, break through enemy lines etc. None of these tasks could be performed by peasant levies.  </p>

<p><em>However, with the exception of Kingsguard, there are no elite troops in Westeros</em></p>

<p>This is not specific to Westeros. The only elite troops we have heard of in Essos is Unsullied. It seems like no one in Planetos cares about elite troops. In fact, it is even worse for Westeros. <strong>How does Kingsguard fight in formation, where discipline is way more important than combat skills?</strong> It feels like seven thickly armored troops would jeopardize the entire regiment.</p>

<p>I am not suggesting they are useless. They may be used to break the formation (as much as seven men can do), reach and kill the enemy general or protect their own general. Their primary purpose is protecting. We also see Kingsguard represent the king in his absence.</p>

<p>Now comes the single combat part. If the enemy general, without loss of generality lets call him Rhaegar, were to face single combat with the allied general, who shall be called Robert, <strong>where are the Kingsguard?</strong> Of course, this is apart from those protecting someone else, who we shall name Lyanna. <strong>If the single combatters are not generals, i.e., two prominent knights, do the rest of the troops around them stop fighting?</strong></p>

<p>It feels like warfare in Medieval Europe is quite off compared to warfare in Westeros, or Planetos in general. The final part of my question is <strong>if we know any famous single combats in battlefield in Medieval Europe.</strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><warfare><medieval>","135363","<h2>Kingsguard are not a battle unit</h2>

<p>Kingsguard are elite bodyguards, not elite shock troops. They do not fight in formation i.e. 7 armored knights whacking anything that comes their way. They are used to take command of different battle units or to protect someone of Royal blood during battle. E.g. Barristan Selmy was sent to take command of dispersed Targaryen troops after Battle of Bells. Prince Lewyn Martell was given command of Dornish Troops at Trident. </p>

<p>So Kingsguard are usually commanders, not foot Soldiers. </p>

<h2>What do Kingsguard do in Single Combat?</h2>

<p>Kingsguard are first and foremost sworn to obey those of the Royal Blood. If they are explicitly commanded to do so, they would most likely stay away. Example would be how King Robert commanded Ser Barristan to stay aside while he takes the boar alone. </p>

<p>The only scenario that I can recall which comes very close is Trial of Seven between King Maegor and Warrior's sons. King Maegor was supported by Kingsguard but they all fought. In the end everyone died, Except King Maegor, who fell into coma right after killing his last foe. </p>

<h2>If Single Combatants are not Generals, what happens?</h2>

<p>Then nobody knows what happens because no one is important enough to be written down in annals of history. They would most likely be interrupted by other soldiers of both sides who may come to support their comrade. </p>

<p>In response to your edit regarding Prominent Knights, since we do not know of enough Knightly Single combats, it would be speculation. </p>

<p>Knights and highborns are captured for ransom so It is unlikely that any man who believes he is good enough to win the ransom would let it pass. </p>

<p>But on the other hand, The only mention of two prominent knights fighting in a huge battle that I can recall right now is fight between Lyn Corbray and Lewyn Martell. Since Lyn is credited for the Kill, it appears no one interfered. Another mention would be the fight between Ser Arthur Dayne and the Smiling knight. That battle also seems to be uninterrupted by other soldiers. </p>

<h2>Disciplined units</h2>

<p>The majority of Armies in Westeros is made up of untrained levies who are poorly equipped and untrained. They gain experience on job. To support them and harden them, there are trained sworn swords and Knights who are well disciplined. </p>

<h2>Rallying routed troops, keeping formation, breaking through enemy lines</h2>

<p>You are right, Peasant levies do not do that. That's why they have heavily armored mounted Knights. They lead the charge on their warhorses and break enemy lines with their lances. They enjoy mobility and can move freely to rally the running foot soldiers. </p>

<p>Kingsguard can however play a role in rallying shattered levies using their charisma and reputation. Ser Barristan Selmy and Ser Jonathor Darry were sent to rally the broken remnants of Lord Jon Connington's troops. </p>

<h2>Do we know any single Combats in Europe?</h2>

<p>That's off-topic. You can take it up on History Stack Exchange. Nevertheless, One Example that I have found is single combat between <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Peresvet"">a Russian Monk and a Mongol Soldier</a> before Battle of Kulikovo.  </p>

<p>Other than middle-ages. there is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Smith_(explorer)#Early_adventures"">John Smith</a> who reportedly killed and beheaded three Ottoman soldiers in single Combat during campaign of Michael the Brave. </p>

"135361","Are there any fully noble-born (and acknowledged) bastards in the Game of Thrones TV show?","<p>In <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> and <em>Game of Thrones</em>, children born to a noble parent, but out of wedlock, are given special ""bastard"" surnames. They are openly acknowledged as the children of a noble, and it's generally expected for their noble parent to take care of them in some way, but they have none of the <em>inherent</em> legal rights of trueborn children.</p>

<p>In the novels, any child born to a lord or lady, who's other parent is not that lord or lady's spouse, is acknowledges as a ""bastard-born"". Most of them involve Lords having affairs with commoners, but not all. For example, Aegon IV had tons of bastards, with both common and highborn mothers (all of which he legitimized on his death.) This lines up with the ""normal English"" definition of the term bastard as well.</p>

<p>However, in the show, as far as I know, all of the <em>acknowledged</em> bastards we have seen have highborn fathers and lowborn mothers:</p>

<li>Jon Snow -- everyone thinks he's Ned's son by a barmaid.</li>
<li>Ramsay Snow -- Roose Bolton's son by a miller's wife.</li>

<p>Other characters with bastard surnames are mentioned but, as far as I know, we don't learn enough about them to know if their parents were both highborn or not.</p>

<p>So, my question is, is the child of two unmarried, but highborn, parents still considered a ""legal bastard"" <em>in the TV universe</em>? Have we seen a single acknowledged example of this on-screen?</p>

<p>The reason I'm asking is because:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/31270834#31270834"">someone</a> contended that Jon Snow isn't really a bastard, since both his parents were nobles, and I contend they are wrong, he is really Jon Waters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, a claim has been made that a child of two noble unwed parents would not get the usual ""bastard"" surname because both their parents were nobles. I am looking for <em>proof</em> that this isn't true in the show.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>To address the current comments and answers:</p>

<p>I know what the English word ""bastard"" means. In the <em>Game of Thrones</em> universe, though, there is a special class of ""bastard"" that has noble parents -- they get a last name, for starters. My question is about <em>those</em> children of two unwed noble parents.</p>

<p>I also what the novels have to say, (which I called out in my question), and there the answer is trivial because we see plenty of bastard-born children with two noble parents. But for this purpose, the novels are irrelevant -- I'm looking for evidence specifically from <em>the TV show</em>, and so far, every instance I have come up with was cut from the show.</p>

<p>(For the record, I'm 100% positive that it doesn't matter but that isn't proof.)</p>

<p><strong>Technically, yes...</strong></p>
<p>To parse down your question if <em>we</em> (meaning the external viewer) have seen a character that is a child of 1) unmarried parents that 2) highborn and 3) considered legal.</p>
<p>The answer to this question would be <strong>Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen Baratheon</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Jaime and Cersei are not married</li>
<li>Lannisters are considered noble</li>
<li>Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen are considered legal</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>However, there is a huge disclaimer to this. Their status is only fully known to us as outside viewers.</strong> The three are considered legal Baratheons because their father (Robert) does not know the children are not his! Only a few people in-universe are aware of this as fact. We do not know what would have happened if the truth had been exposed AND accepted. Remember Ned claimed he was lying and a traitor and Joffrey was Robert's true son before he was executed, and through extension anyone else claiming the same is considered a traitor.</p>

<p><strong>A bastard is a bastard if their parents were not married at the time the child was born.</strong></p>
<p>Only a King by Royal Decree can legitimize a bastard. Hence, Jon is bastard because his parents were not married <sup>1</sup>... it does not matter who they were. The story of Daemon Blackfyre shows this.</p>
<p>While not physically seen on-screen, <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Daemon_I_Blackfyre"" rel=""noreferrer"">Daemon Blackfyre</a> is (arguably) the highest-profile person that could be considered a &quot;noble-born&quot; bastard.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Daemon was the bastard son of Aegon IV Targaryen and his first cousin Daena the Defiant, the infamous daughter of Aegon III Targaryen. Daena named him after her grandfather. He was conceived during Daena's imprisonment in the Maidenvault. Daemon was raised in the Red Keep and was taught arms by Ser Quentyn Ball, the master-at-arms at the Red Keep.</p>
<p>The identity of his father was kept secret until his twelfth birthday, when Daemon distinguished himself during a tourney melee by besting a score of other squires. Afterwards, his father, King Aegon IV, acknowledged Daemon as his bastard son and presented him with Blackfyre, the Valyrian steel sword of Targaryen kings.</p>
<p>He took the name of Blackfyre for his house and displayed the inverted Targaryen arms, a black three-headed dragon on red.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Daemon was born to two Targaryens but still considered  a bastard, even by his own father. Even once Daemon was acknowledge he did not gain the Targaryen name.  <a href=""https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Aegon_IV_Targaryen"" rel=""noreferrer"">Aegon IV legitimized all his bastards on his death bed</a> which would eventually cause the <a href=""https://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Blackfyre_Rebellion"" rel=""noreferrer"">Blackfyre Rebllions</a></p>
<p>To prove Daemon Blackfyre is part of show canon: <a href=""https://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/The_Death_of_Kings"" rel=""noreferrer"">&quot;The Death of Kings&quot;</a> is part of the &quot;Histories &amp; Lore&quot;, a special feature in the Blu-ray of Season 4 of <em>Game of Thrones</em>. It is narrated by Conleth Hill as Varys, who narrates several instances of regicide during the history of the Seven Kingdoms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Decades later, Aegon the Unworthy legitimized all of his bastards on his deathbed. Inevitably, the greatest of these - Daemon Blackfyre - declared himself the rightful heir and ignited yet another war for the crown. After much bloodshed, Daemon was killed by an alliance of his half-brothers on the Redgrass Field. All the same, his descendants continued to threaten the Targaryens until half a century later, when Barristan the Bold slew Maelys the Monstrous on the Stepstones, extinguishing Daemon's line.</p>

"135432","Why did Lords of Vale swear allegiance to a Northman?","<p>In season 6 episode 10 we saw:</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Jon Snow was proclaimed King in the North and everyone present chanted
 ""King in the North"" for Jon including the Lords and Knights of the
 Vale.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is unusual because:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Vale has always been a distinct Kingdom in Westeros, ruled by House Arryn for centuries. </li>
<li>In the past, the Vale and the North were bitter enemies and fought several wars over the islands of Three Sisters for centuries. </li>
<li>Valemen are mostly Andal (with a few exceptions like the Royces, Redforts etc.) while Northmen are mostly First Men (with a few exceptions like the Manderlys)</li>
<li>Valemen follow the Faith of the Seven while Northmen follow the Old Gods. </li>
<li>The Vale's Lord Arryn is cousin of Lady Sansa Stark but he is not related to Jon Snow at all.</li>
<li>The Vale has never been ruled by any Northern House while North has never been ruled by a Valeman. </li>
</ol>

<p>So given all this, the Vale is a distinct region with ethnic, religious, social and historical differences with the North. They do not have any reason to support Jon Snow's bid for sovereignty. </p>

<p>Petyr Baelish may have brought the Lords of the Vale with him in hopes of marrying Sansa and seating her on Throne of Kings of Winter but that hope has gone awry given that Sansa has spurned Baelish's proposal. </p>

<p>Some people may point out that the Riverlords previously did so as well when Robb was proclaimed King in the North, but the Riverlands have never been independent for a long time. Before Aegon the Conqueror came, they were ruled by the Ironborn. The Royal Houses of the Riverlands are extinct, unlike the Vale where House Arryn still rules. </p>

<p>So why would the Lords of the Vale accept the rule of a Stark bastard instead of supporting independence of the Vale in alliance with the North?</p>

<p>Or in case that it is my misunderstanding the Valemen took Jon for their King (it is possible that they may have been just acknowledging Jon's sovereignty on North), is there any evidence that they did not proclaim Jon as their King as well?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> It has been pointed out that Baelish said he had declared for House Stark so Valemen Aristocrats were right to join the chant. What is not pointed out is that Baelish explicitly told Sansa that she was the future of House Stark. Jon is not a legitimate member of House Stark and was still a bastard. Northmen may have some sentiments of Stark loyalty and revenge for Red Wedding playing for them but that is nothing to Aristocracy of Vale. Why should they suffer a bastard of a Northman to be hailed as King? Why should they kneel before a bastard when they can kneel before their own trueborn Lord who comes from line of Artys Arryn, the Falcon Knight. </p>
","<game-of-thrones><politics>","135434","<p>Just because the Knights of the Vale chanted &quot;King in the North&quot; doesn't mean that they are submitting to his rule. They might simply be recognising him as literally King of the <strong>North</strong> (and not The Vale).</p>
<p>In any case, I don't believe that the knights would be accepting a new ruler without the consent (or even presence) of their own lord.</p>
<p>In a scene with Sansa, Lord Baelish tells her that he has declared for the Starks. So, if the lords of the Vale do swear allegiance to a Northman it is in line with the Lord Protector of the Vale and their de facto leader.</p>

<ul>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>what was the point of blowing out the entire Sept?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>She had all her enemies in one place. The High Sparrow, the Sparrows, the Tyrells, etc. What was lost in the show is that the crown owed the Faith A LOT of gold, which is how the Sparrows came to power to begin with; crown a new High Septon who will forgive your debt.</p></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>It killed lots of innocents (surrounding buildings also got destroyed). The Great Sept of Baelor building also had historic significance</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since when as Cersei cared about innocents? Remember this was woman who was going to have all the highborn maidens killed by Ser Illyn if the Battle of Blackwater was lost not mention going to poison her own son. Would have seen her own brother (Tyrion) killed for a crime he did not commit. Plotted the demise of her own husband. Plotted the initial demise of House Stark. <em>In the game of thrones, you win or you die...</em></p>

<p>As far as the building goes, this is I think a call back to the books in which she burns down the Tower of the Hand after Tywin is killed.</p></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>And if she didn't care any of this, at least it was a total waste of precious Wildfire which could be used in wars.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as she knew the war(s) had basically been won at this point. The North has been demolished and taken control by the Boltons (whom at this point still was assumed to be loyal to the crown). The East was held by Littlefinger (whom at this point still was assumed to be loyal to the crown). The South was either the Tyrells who have a stake in the crown and Martells who were on her hit list but not a military power. The Iron Islands have actively sided with her now that Euron has taken over. Daenrys is still in Essos and assumed a non-threat. Jon Snow is still a bastard of the Night's Watch and not a threat. </p></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>She could make the faith illegal. She had access to powerful armies and royal guards which could kill all the extremists one by one. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not exactly... Remember this is the same faith that had the power to imprison her in the first place. Cersei is not Queen, just Queen Mother. Tommen and Margarey held the true power. The Kingsguard even rode to the gates of the to forcefully take back Cersei if needed but were ultimately told to stand down by Tommen. Once she is out of prison, Tommen basically has her relegated to her chambers. She is not in any real position to give orders except to maybe the Mountain. Which as a much of a monster as he is probably couldn't take on hundreds of armed sparrows.</p></li>
<li><blockquote>
  <p>Why didn't she choose this option? Why did she go for Mad King's signature move which could spark more rebellion?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, who could say she actually did it? It was merely a tragic accident from long forgotten things done by the Mad King (hey remember when us Lannisters helped overthrow that guy?). </p>

<p>Out-of-universe, it shows the viewers that yes Cersei has gone fully mad, as mad as the Mad King was. </p></li>

<p>I am wondering what Cersei thinks about the heir and the family's legacy her father talked about.</p>

<p>Given that she regularly has sex with her brother these days, can she give birth to her brother's child once again?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","202935","<h1>Implied yes, probably not but unknown</h1>

<p>When Tyrion goes to see Cersei to bargain for her help her actions indicate to him that she is pregnant. Tyrion then heavily suspects this and asks her outright and we get no answer. However, note the bottom line from the quote below which heavily implies she is in fact pregnant. But also note <em>""Tyrion sees what he sees, and knows what it means.""</em> which is also implying that Cersei is doing this on purpose so Tyrion will think she is pregnant, i.e. is she manipulating him?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>TYRION:</strong> She knows herself. She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses, instead of feeding them. That’s the difference between you.</p>
  
  <p><strong>CERSEI:</strong> I don’t care about checking my worst impulses. I don’t care about making the world a better place. Hang the world.</p>
  
  <p><em>Cersei folds her hands across her stomach.</em></p>
  
  <p><strong>CERSEI:</strong> That thing you dragged here, I know what it is and I know what it
  means. And when it came at me, I didn’t think about the world. Not at all. As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat.</p>
  
  <p><em>Tyrion notices the barely perceptible movement of Cersei’s bottom hand over her belly.</em></p>
  
  <p><strong>CERSEI:</strong> All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from
  those who mean the most to me. Away from my family.</p>
  
  <p><em><strong>Tyrion sees what he sees, and knows what it means.</strong> He can hardly believe it, but he knows it to be true.</em></p>
  
  <p><strong>CERSEI:</strong> Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea: get on a boat, take those who
  matter--</p>
  
  <p><strong>TYRION:</strong> You’re pregnant.</p>
  
  <p><em>She stays silent for too long, long enough to tell him that he’s right.</em></p>
  
  <p><em>And once she knows he knows, she can think of nothing else to say.</em></p>
  
  <p><sub><em>Game of Thrones</em>, Season 7 Episode 7, ""The Dragon and the Wolf""</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>She then makes some sort of a scene with telling Jon and Dany in front of Tyrion that she will march her armies north to help in the Great War.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>And then Cersei enters behind him, with Jaime, Qyburn, the Mountain and the Queensguard in tow. Varys reenters as well.</em></p>
  
  <p><strong>CERSEI:</strong> My armies will not stand down. I will not pull them back to the
  capital. <em>(beat)</em> I will march them north, to fight alongside you in the Great War. The darkness is coming for us all. We will face it together.</p>

  <p><sub><em>Game of Thrones</em>, Season 7 Episode 7, ""The Dragon and the Wolf""</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, as we find out later on Cersei does not intend to send her armies north at all and it is all a ploy. It is very possible that the pregnancy is faked to make sure Tyrion believes her and to also try and make him look foolish to Dany. We know Cersei hates Tyrion and that Tyrion's plans have all pretty much failed for Dany and so he is skating on thin ice. It is likely Cersei is trying to make him look worse.</p>

<blockquote>

  fight alongside them? Are you a traitor or an idiot?</p>

  expect me to command our troops to fight beside foreign scum? To fight for the Dragon Queen?</p>

  <p><strong>CERSEI:</strong> And I saw it burn. If dragons can’t stop them, if Dothraki and Unsullied and Northmen can’t stop them, how will our army make a difference?</p>

<p>Later in the conversation Cersei and Jaime do mention the yet to come child in a passing moment meaning he knows about it. And yet later at the end they mention it again but it seems as a way of Cersei still trying to manipulate Jaime to stay. When he finally leaves he says <em>""I don't believe you""</em>. Now in context this seems to mean ""I don't believe you'll kill me"" but I think it also expands into the greater meaning of ""I've given up on your lies and deception and don't believe <em>you</em> at all anymore"". Which then further implies he might not believe her about the child.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>CERSEI:</strong> Disobeying your Queen’s command. Fighting with her enemies. What would you call it?</p>

  <p><strong>JAIME:</strong> Give the order, then.</p>
  
  <p><em>He watches her and waits.</em></p>

<p>Of course this is all pretty much speculation at the moment until the last season but I think the evidence would suggest she isn't pregnant if you look past Cersei's word which isn't really worth much.</p>

<p>It is also worth mentioning that Cersei's prophecy from Maggy only ever mentions three children and so far it has actually been quite accurate.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>MAGGY:</strong> Three questions you get. You won’t like the answers.</p>
  
  <p><strong>CERSEI:</strong> I’ve been promised to the prince. When will we marry?</p>
  
  <p><strong>MAGGY:</strong> You’ll never wed the prince. You’ll wed the king.</p>
  
  <p><strong>CERSEI:</strong> But I will be queen?</p>
  
  <p><strong>MAGGY:</strong> Oh yes, you’ll be queen. For a time. In comes another. Younger, more beautiful, to cast you down and take all you hold dear.</p>
  
  <p><strong>CERSEI:</strong> Will the king and I have children?</p>
  
  <p><strong>MAGGY:</strong> No. The king will have 20 children, and you will have 3.</p>
  
  <p><strong>CERSEI:</strong> That doesn’t make sense.</p>
  
  <p><strong>MAGGY:</strong> Gold will be their crowns. Gold their shrouds.</p>

<p>Joffrey is laid to rest at Great Sept of Baelor as evident from ASOS Chapter 67 (Jaime's POV):</p>

<p>Well, I always wonder why producers and directors go for nudity. I believe everything could be made family friendly without sacrificing any content.

In short he includes it because history has it and not to include it would be hiding the truth and not telling the full story. <a href=""https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/05/02/george-r-r-martin-on-game-of-thrones-and-sexual-violence/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=1&amp;"" rel=""noreferrer"">Here is one such interview</a> focused on sexual violence but his answer mainly extends to nudity as a whole.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Why have you included incidents of rape or sexual violence in your “Song of Ice and Fire” novels? What larger themes are you trying to bring out with these scenes?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> An artist has an obligation to tell the truth. My novels are epic fantasy, but they are inspired by and grounded in history. Rape and sexual violence have been a part of every war ever fought, from the ancient Sumerians to our present day. To omit them from a narrative centered on war and power would have been fundamentally false and dishonest, and would have undermined one of the themes of the books: that the true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves. We are the monsters. (And the heroes too). Each of us has within himself the capacity for great good, and great evil.</p>

<p>That is the last we see of it, however, a lot of focus is put on this feather. So, where did it come from and considering its focus in the trailer is there any significance to it?</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","203386","<h2>Robert Baratheon put it there</h2>
<p>Back in the very first episode, &quot;Winter is Coming&quot;, Robert asks Ned to take him to see Lyanna. When down in the crypts he puts a feather in the hands of Lyanna's statue and this appears to be the same one.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that back in Season 5 Episode 4, &quot;Sons of the Harpy&quot;, we see Sansa pick the feather up and dust it off. I don't think we see her put it back on the statue though but we can infer that she did. The scene can be seen here:</p>

            </div></div></p>
<p>As for its significance, well it appears as though it is hinting at Jon's true parentage and is also symbolism for Robert's doomed love for Lyanna. First off Jon knocks the feather off the statue as he is the son of Lyanna and Rhaegar which broke Robert and at the same time a voice over of says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lyanna:</strong> You have to protect him.</p>
<p><sub><em>Game of Thrones</em>, Season 8 teaser/trailer</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This echoes what Lyanna says to Ned when she hands over the baby Jon in the flashback scene at the Tower of Joy.</p>
<p>The feather then freezes over which further references the Robert's doomed love but could also be a reference to the tourney at Harrenhal, which Petyr and Sansa discuss in the before mentioned scene. Here they tell of the <em>&quot;crown of winter roses in Lyanna's lap, blue with frost&quot;</em> that Rhaegar lay in Lyanna's lap.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>BAELISH:</strong> I saw her once. I was a boy, living with your mother's family. Lord Whent had a great tourney at Harrenhal. Everyone was there. The Mad King, your father, Robert Baratheon. And Lyanna, she was already promised to Robert. You can imagine what it was like for me, a boy from nowhere, with nothing to his name, watching these legendary men, tilting at the lists. The last two riders were Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen. When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for the prince. I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair. How handsome he was. Until he rode right past his wife, Elia Martell, and all the smiles died. I've never seen so many people so quiet. He rode past his wife, and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyanna's lap. Blue as frost. How many tens of thousands had to die because Rhaegar chose your aunt?</p>
<p><strong>SANSA:</strong> Yes, he chose her… and then he kidnapped her and raped her.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Note that I've seen reference to Robert having given Lyanna feathers as a symbol of his love before riding off for the Rebellion but this appears to be untrue as I can find no canon reference to this myself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Jon walks by, a feather falls from the statue. This is the feather that King Robert put there in the Season 1 pilot, when he visited the crypts during his stay in Winterfell. Robert would bring feathers to Lyanna before the rebellion as a symbol of his love, and Sansa finds that final feather still in the crypts in Season 5, lying at Lyanna’s feet, and returns it to the statue’s hand.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This article also makes note of Robert doing this in the none canon pilot episode rather then the very first episode where it does happen as the released script for the actual pilot doesn't include the feather. Therefore, I'd say to be careful to take this article at face value.</p>

"203552","Is the origin of the words 'valar' and 'Valyrian' the same?","<p>In the series <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, we know the phrases 'valar morghulis' and 'valar dohaeris' mean 'all men must die' and 'all men must serve', respectively. It immediately follows that 'valar' means 'all men' and seems to be a nod towards Tolkien's <a href=""http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Valar"" rel=""noreferrer"">Valar</a> and looks/sounds similar to the Old Norse word <a href=""https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/valr"" rel=""noreferrer"">'valr' meaning 'the slain'</a>.</p>

<p>We also have 'Valyria' for the location in Essos. While (in English) someone from Valyria is known as a 'Valyrian', 'Valyrian' and 'valar' are fairly similar words, so it seems at least possible that one came from the other, or have the same etymology (both in- and out- of world).</p>

<p>While it's known that GRRM <a href=""http://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2010/04/12/klaatu-barada-nicto/"" rel=""noreferrer"">isn't an expert on languages</a>, the creator of the languages for the TV show <em>is</em>.

<p><sub><em>Note: I am not a linguist and am essentially in the same boat as GRRM where if I ever create a language I'd go for nice sounding words. Therefore, my answer is mainly pieced together from what GRRM has said in the past and what I know of the very little information on the language.</em></sub></p>

<hr>

<p>See my research into this below:</p>

<p>I've done some research into the languages now, and in the past, and there is generally very little information on the ASOIAF canon languages because George himself has very little information on it. Here is pretty much what we know:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>George is not a linguist</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The lack of language variation in Westeros was brought up -- lots of cultures, like the Dornish, the ironborn, the northmen -- but everyone speaks the common tongue. <strong>George admitted it wasn't very realistic, but he admitted he stole the idea from Tolkien.</strong> He admitted he could have more languages, but the books are in English and so he'd create more nonsense words to represent languages and then have to ""translate"" them anyway. He admitted it'd be more realistic to have seven or eight -- or even fourteen, or twenty-three -- languages, but also Tolkien was a genuine linguist, a brilliant one. He went through how many languages Tolkien made for LotR, and he says that sometimes he says when reading the books he just wants to strangle Tolkien because of how many great names he'd have, and <strong>how he could give the same thing four different names (in various languages) that all sounded great. He added that the vast majority of fantasists are in the same boat as him. Then he recounted the anecdote -- which he's recounted before -- of someone mistaking him for a Tolkien type and wanting his grammar and glossary and the like of Valyrian, and George admitting that Valyrian was seven words, and when he needs an eighth he'll make it then.</strong></p>
  
  <p><sub><a href=""https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Stockholm_and_Archipelacon_Report"" rel=""noreferrer"">westeros, So Spake Martin, STOCKHOLM AND ARCHIPELACON REPORT</a></sub></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>His languages aren't developed at all (see the quotes above and below)</p></li>
<li><p>His languages generally consist of N words</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>[How developed is Valyrian?]</strong></p>
  
  <p>""How little"" have I developed Valyrian is the real question. I am not, alas, J.R.R. Tolkien, and I cannot imagine taking a decade to actually work up not one, but two, entire languages. I have something like eight words of Valyrian. When I need a ninth, I'll make one up.</p>
  
  <p>Sorry if that disillusions any of you. It's all smoke and mirrors, kids.</p>
  
  <p><sub><a href=""https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Writing_Direwolves_Valyrian_Lyanna_and_Harrenhal_and_Giants"" rel=""noreferrer"">westeros, So Spake Martin, WRITING DIREWOLVES, VALYRIAN, LYANNA AND HARRENHAL, AND GIANTS</a></sub></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>If he needs another word he'll make it up (see above)</p></li>
<li><p>He chooses words that sound right (see first quote on Tolkien about ""great sounding names"")</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Looking further we can see that of the known High Valyrian there are only five words, excluding nouns, with a possible sixth in the books: dracarys, valar, morghulis, dohaeris, valonqar and potentially maegi. Therefore, with 2 of these having the <em>""val""</em> start it is likely that this was a common start GRRM wanted to use: similar to the <em>""ae""</em> used commonly. As such it seems likely he just chose it cos valar sounds similar to Valyrian and sounds right.</p>

<p>With that said GRRM has been very open about his inspirations of which Tolkien is a massive one. For example, see this quote where he talks more about how much he's read Tolkien's works rather than his inspiration from him but this gives more of an idea of how much he's likely to be inspired from him whether consciously or otherwise:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>GRRM: Well, you know there are a number of them. There is a lot of great fantasy out there. <strong>Of course, J.R.R. Tolkien, I think is the giant who looms above the entire realm of fantasy. I read Lord of the Rings when I was back in Junior High School still writing those stories for fanzines and it had a profound effect on me. I re-read it every few years, so obviously Tolkien would have to top any list of my own favorites.</strong> Another writer that I'm enormously in love with is Jack Vance, who I think is our greatest living Science Fiction and Fantasy author. Vance has written a lot more science fiction than fantasy but he exceeds at both realms. His Dying Earth, which [was] originally was published in the late 40s or early 50s, is a seminal work and he’s done some wonderful fantasy ever since. I read a Vance book the moment it comes out; anytime a new one comes I put down whatever I'm doing and go right to it. But there [is] also a lot of other good fantasy being done -- I could answer this question for a long, long time, but I think Tolkien and Vance would have to top any list of mine. They've been on top of my personal hit parade for decades now.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>As such it seems likely again that while Valyrian came first valar was probably chosen because it sounds right, is similar and is the same as <a href=""http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Valar"" rel=""noreferrer"">Valar</a> from Tolkien's works as you suggest. It's not unknown of for GRRM to slip in references here and there, for example, <a href=""https://scifi.stackexchange.com/q/156265/58193"">the Muppets</a> and I believe he's referenced football teams as well. So again it seems possible that the word came from Tolkien's works but no explicit mention is made.</p>

<p>I'm aware this probably isn't the answer you was looking for but I compiled a lot of research into this as to what we know and what answer it points to so worthwhile sharing it. I've also reached out to GRRM so if I ever get a response I'll update with a concrete answer.</p>

"203647","What did Varys mean by 'I did what I did for the good of the realm'?","<p>In the “chaos is a ladder” exchange between Varys and Littlefinger in season 3 episode 6 this line came up in the dialogue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Petyr 'Littlefinger' Baelish</strong>: You're so right. For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells, if I'm going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there. But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect... you didn't bring her any enjoyment, and she didn't bring me any enjoyment. She was a bad investment on my part. Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new. Something daring. And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience.</p>
<p><strong>Lord Varys</strong>: I did what I did for the good of the realm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm curious, what was Varys referring to by that?</p>
<p>My question is, specifically, <strong>what action is Varys referring to here?</strong> It seems as though it's something unlawful or immoral that he has to excuse his actions to someone like Littlefinger. In <em>the end justifies the means</em> sort of way, if you will.</p>
","<game-of-thrones>","203792","<p>After going through the third season again, I believe I reached a reasonable cocnlusion. At the start of the season, Ros is seen reporting to Varys that she's helping Littlefinger depart to the Eyrie. And that she's found his shipboard inventory that shows he's bringing two feather beds along in his cabin. This leads Varys to believe Littlefinger is taking Sansa with him. Varys then meets with Olenna and tells her about Littlefinger's  plans to steal Sansa away. </p>

<p>Now Sansa, who's practically a hostage of the crown, holds the key to the north. If Littlefinger was to marry her he would have the north in his pocket. Varys views Littlefinger as a dangerous man. And his rising in power would be unfavorable to <em>the good of the realm</em>. Lest that happens, he suggests that Sansa should be wed to Loras instead.</p>

<p>Littlefinger finds out about Varys and Olenna's scheme. As well as the fact that Ros has been spying for Varys (possibly because she's the only other person with access to the manifest?). For this, he gives her to Joffrey who then torments her to death.</p>

<p>So by ""I did what I did for the good of the realm"" Varys is referring to his conspiracy with Olenna to snatch Sansa, a valuable hostage to the crown, from Littlefinger, the man who ""would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes"". Hinting at a slight guilt or disapproval that it indirectly led to Ros' death on Joffrey's hands.</p>

<p>Both ""Ramsays"" are spelled the same way, and the syllable structure of ""Bolton"" is similar to ""Gordon."" Both can be sadistic bastards, albeit one is somewhat worse.

<p>True, Daenerys was the primary impetus behind the killing of the khals. Most of the credit for their deaths must go to her planning, not to mention her resistance to fire. By barring the door, however, Daario and Jorah ensured that none of the khals could escape the inferno. They also eliminated the khals' guard, thus depriving them of people who could have saved the khals, unbarred the door, put out the fire, or seized Daenerys. <strong>Had the khals escaped, they most assuredly would have ordered Daenerys killed.</strong> Thus, by preventing their escape, Jorah helped save Daenerys's life. </p>

"139276","What does ""It is known"" mean?","<p>Many times in the books and in the TV show we hear various persons say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is known.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does this mean? How do they establish that ""something"" is known? Dothraki don't strike me as having a lot of schooling or any written history.</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","139277","<p>It means the same thing that English speakers mean by the phrase ""They say that..."" or ""everybody knows that..."" or similar. They are the Essos equivalent of old wives' tales.</p>

<p>It's information that is ""common knowledge"" just by being passed around via word of mouth. One person tells someone else something they think is true, and that person then tells someone else, and eventually those ideas start being repeated to people who have heard them before, thus reinforcing them. At that point, they become ""known.""</p>

<p>In particular, it's important to note that ""it is known"" <em>doesn't mean</em> it's right. There are plenty of things we're told are ""known"" that are just old wives tales, or rumors, or myths, but are just plain false. </p>

<p>I'm interested to know if anyone can help me figure out who is in the photo?
There are some who are clearly obvious, but some which are not.</p>

<p><strong>Who are these Game of Thrones (ASOIAF) characters?</strong></p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire><character-identification>","139333","<p>From foreground to background, then left to right:</p>

<h2>This side of the pool</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ned</strong> and <strong>Cat</strong> taking some rest. Ned appears to be drinking <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Stripe"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Red Stripe</a>; presumably <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_Brown_Ale"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Newky Brown Ale</a> wasn't an option</li>
<li><strong>Cersei</strong> and <strong>Jaime</strong> on a date. Cersei's glammed up in a red dress and looks to be on her second bottle of wine already, Jaime's posing in a designer polo shirt.</li>
</ul>

<h2>In the pool</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Robb</strong> and [<strong>Talisa/Jeyne</strong> Westerling] play with <strong>Grey Wind</strong>, with two unidentifiable characters. Based on how other characters cluster and interact in this image, I'd guess it's <strong>Theon</strong> awkwardly being the couple's third wheel and [<strong>Asha/Yara</strong>] swimming over to stop him making a nuisance of himself.</li>
<li><strong>Bran</strong> riding <strong>Hodor</strong> plays with <strong>Rickon</strong> and <strong>Shaggydog</strong>, while <strong>Summer</strong>, <strong>Jojen</strong> and <strong>Meera</strong> watch</li>
<li><strong>Jon</strong>, <strong>Ygritte</strong>, <strong>Gendry</strong> and <strong>Hot Pie</strong> try to dodge <strong>Arya</strong> cannonballing into the pool</li>
<li><strong>Gilly</strong>, holding what is presumably her baby, chats to a blushing <strong>Sam</strong>, while <strong>Nymeria</strong> and <strong>Ghost</strong> sit by the side of the pool watching their humans foolishly playing, wearing what look like expressions of wolfish disdain </li>
</ul>

<h2>On the path around the pool</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Gregor</strong> sits and eats, not caring that he's in the way of anyone trying to walk past</li>
</ul>

<h2>Behind that path</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Loras</strong> chats to a blushing <strong>Sansa</strong> while <strong>Margaery</strong> does her hair and half-listens to a scowling <strong>Joffrey</strong>. <strong>Lady</strong> takes a nap</li>
<li><strong>Olena</strong> and <strong>Twyin</strong> relax and watch the silly oafs at play while smirking from some shade, presumably giving some shade of their own</li>
<li><strong>Sandor</strong> lies back and relaxes, while keeping an eye on Gregor. I think it's Sandor since there seems to be the burnt gap in his hair, but he looks a bit skinny for Sandor. It could also be Bronn with a side parting, sitting near Tyrion but not getting involved in Tyrion's family stuff</li>
<li><strong>Tyrion</strong> makes a big show of giving food to <strong>Tommen</strong> and <strong>Myrcella</strong>, while <strong>Shae</strong> does all the hard work. [credit to SystemDown] Tommen's cats, <strong>Ser Pounce</strong> and <strong>Balerion</strong>, are skulking by Tommen's feet, clearly aware it's meal time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Beyond the Wall</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Oberyn</strong> and <strong>Ellaria</strong> take a romantic stroll</li>
<li><strong>Varys</strong>, holding what looks like a little bird, and presumably <strong>Littlefinger</strong> take a stroll, though the likeness isn't clear this far out. It's possibly a better likeness for <strong>Illyrio Mopatis</strong> with Varys, which would make sense, but would leave us with the (always worrying) question, where is Littlefinger and what is he up to? The guy on the sunlounger near Tywin could be Littlefinger from his build and face, and it'd make sense for him to be near but not with the other arch-schemers, but the hair's not right.</li>
<li><strong>Jorah</strong> (presumably, though the likeness isn't clear this far out) follows behind Dany, loyally carrying all her stuff while she ignores him and chats to other people</li>
<li><strong>Dany</strong> strolls and chats with <strong>Jhiqui</strong> (darker) and <strong>Irri</strong> (lighter). I'm assuming it's them, because no other pair of Dany's female companions are close enough that you'd expect them to walk arm in arm like this. It is known.</li>

"205033","Why didn't the killers burn Snow's body?","<p>In <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> men of the Night's Watch kill</p>

<blockquote class=""spoiler"">
  <p> Jon Snow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why didn't they burn his body? Didn't they fear that he may become a wight?</p>
","<game-of-thrones><a-song-of-ice-and-fire>","205046","<p>The below speculates with the known information on what could possibly be the reasons though we don't know for sure. However, it is worth noting initially that the dead cannot be turned into wights south of the Wall. White Walkers have to use their magic to turn the dead and the Wall has magic that can stop the &quot;dead passing&quot; which probably means it stops their magic also.</p>
<p>Now I'm not sure if the Brothers know this or not but it is worth noting that it isn't strictly necessary to burn their bodies. Although Jon does state that those in the tunnel who died against the giant were to be burned so potentially they think either all need to be burned of being in the tunnel is a bit of a grey area so were just being safe.</p>
<hr />
<h1><em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em></h1>
<p>We don’t know because we see nothing of Jon after the stabbing and murder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jon fell to his knees. He found the dagger's hilt and wrenched it free. In the cold night air the wound was smoking. &quot;Ghost,&quot; he whispered. Pain washed over him. Stick them with the pointy end. When the third dagger took him between the shoulder blades, he gave a grunt and fell face-first into the snow. He never felt the fourth knife. Only the cold...</p>
<p><sub><em>A Dance with Dragons</em>, Jon XIII</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is the last paragraph of the last chapter we have of a perspective at the Wall so we don't know anything that happens afterwards just yet.</p>
<h1><em>Game of Thrones</em></h1>
<p>The last we see of Jon in Season 5 is him dying in a puddle of his own blood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The brothers retreat, leaving Jon to die alone on the ground, bleeding out. The light goes out of his open eyes as we fade on Season 5.</em></p>
<p><sub><em>Game of Thrones</em>, Season 5 Episode 10, &quot;Mother’s Mercy&quot; - Official Script</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Season 6 then opens with Davos spotting Jon’s body in the snow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>EXT. CASTLE BLACK - NIGHT</strong></p>
<p><em>Pan down from the inside of The Wall towards Castle Black. GHOST is howling. Slow zoom to JON SNOW's body, lying in the snow. A sign with the word &quot;TRAITOR&quot; is posted on a beam behind him. Closeup on JON SNOW. He is staring upwards, lifelessly. GHOST howls louder and pushes against the door to his pen.</em></p>
<p><strong>CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK - DAVOS' CHAMBER</strong></p>
<p><em>DAVOS hears GHOST's howling and exits, then peers across the courtyard and sees JON SNOW's body. He immediately runs down the steps. He slows as he approaches JON SNOW's body. Other brothers of the Night's Watch approach. DAVOS kneels beside JON SNOW's body.</em></p>
<p><strong>NIGHT'S WATCHMAN:</strong> It's the Lord Commander!</p>
<p><em>DOLOROUS EDD and other Night's Watchmen rush up behind DAVOS.</em></p>
<p><strong>DAVOS:</strong> Help me get him inside.</p>
<p><em>The other Night's Watch brothers pick up JON SNOW's body and carry it away. DAVOS remains, staring at the left over pool of blood.</em></p>
<p><sub><em>Game of Thrones</em>, Season 6 Episode 1, &quot;The Red Woman&quot;</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whilst we don’t know for sure why Thorne and the others left Jon's body there we can speculate on the following.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To send a message to the others that anyone else that goes against what they want will be killed too.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To hide that it was them, whilst it obviously was them, not being caught at the scene could help their case if they needed to defend themselves later on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although of course considering he openly admits it later on so he can bend the other Brothers to his way of thinking it is almost certainly done to send a message. He needs the other brothers to understand what happened and why it happened so they can come into his line of thinking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>ALLISER THORNE:</strong> We’ve committed treason, all of us. Jon Snow was my Lord Commander. I had no love for him. That was no secret. But I never once disobeyed an order. Loyalty is the foundation on which the Night’s Watch is built, and the Watch means everything to me. I have given my life, we have all given our lives to the Night’s Watch. Jon Snow was going to destroy the Night’s Watch. He let the wildlings through our gates, as no Lord Commander has ever done before. He gave them the very land on which they reaved and raped and murdered. Lord Commander Snow did what he thought was right, I’ve no doubt about that. And what he thought was right would have been the end of us. He thrust a terrible choice upon us, and we made it.</p>
<p><em>The men begin to murmur among themselves.</em></p>
<p><sub><em>Game of Thrones</em>, Season 6 Episode 1, &quot;The Red Woman&quot;</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or they may have been going to actually get some firewood to burn him, we simply don't have enough information on the time frame from them killing him to Davos finding him. Of course considering the above this seems unlikely.</p>
