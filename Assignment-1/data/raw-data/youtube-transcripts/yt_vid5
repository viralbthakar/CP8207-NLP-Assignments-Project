 this world wasn't always so small and petty thousands of years ago while the rest of men prayed to gods the Valyrians became them through magic or sheer will they mastered the greatest creatures in history a horse grunts man dominion over the land a ship over the sea but dragons gave us the sky and everything and everyone beneath it at its height my ancestors ruled the known world whatever parts we didn't weren't worth known our capital of Valyria shamed the Magnificent cities of the East for hammers and chisels were no match for Dragon Fire sorcery it was a city and an empire built to last until the end of time it didn't 400 years ago the doom fell on Valyria mountains cracked open like eggs lakes and rivers boiled fountains of fire ash and smoke spewed from the ground so high and so hot that even dragons burned in flight the land splintered and the angry sea rushed in in hours the greatest city in history became history but my ancestors didn't burn nor drown with the rest of their race 12 years before the doom despite the sneers of his rivals aina Targaryen abandoned the capital with his family legends claim that his daughter foresaw the destruction of the city in a dream more likely a nar met with some mishap at court and chose exile over execution he and House Targaryen slicked away to a dreary remote godforsaken island forsaken no longer with arts now lost to the world we transformed a tiny outpost into Dragonstone a fortress fit for the last dragon Lords then a nars descendants settled into it like a tomb for their lost homeland until a gun when he looked east he saw the past old tired dead but when he looked West he saw the future gold in the world gold in the fields and no dragons in the sky but his he and his sisters Rhaenys and Visenya flew over the great continent ostensibly visitors to a strange land but when Aegon returned he ordered construction of a massive table carved in the shape of Westeros with all the notable rivers and mountains that they had seen a personal map of the Seven Kingdoms then ruled by seven squabbling families house-door ndon held the Stormlands from their seated storms end due south of Dragonstone house horror of the Iron Islands had also conquered and enslaved the Riverlands and ruled them from Harrenhal a monstrous castle rising on the shore of the Gods I how stark held the frozen wasteland of the North the oldest largest and emptiest of the kingdom has Lannister held the westerland's the wealthiest Kingdom thanks to their gold mines house Gardner held the reach of the second wealthiest Kingdom thanks to their crops as Aaron held the Vale or rather the Vale them the mountains were impossible except through the bloody gate which had never been taken house martell held the deserts of dome from the plate because no one else wanted them together the Seven Kingdoms made Westeros a realm that wasn't yet around ruled by great families who didn't know what greatness was Aegon would teach them though house Durand entitled themselves storm Kings they were little more than gusts their Kingdom in the Stormlands had been doddering to its end for the past few centuries helped along by other houses most of all by house horror who were nearly finished with a monstrous castle at Harrenhal too large and too costly a seat to rule only the Riverlands King Argyll acne where the Ironborn would soon turn you think a king who wanted to keep his crown would be wary of a man with fire-breathing monsters but King hoggle actor and and wasn't called the arrogant for nothing determined to arrest his families decline he sent an envoy to Dragonstone to enlist Aegon Targaryen and his dragons against his enemies in exchange our Dilek offered lands he didn't have and a wife Aegon didn't need for as the Valerians did Aegon had where'd his elder sister Visenya then as the Valerians didn't he took the younger Rhaenys as well two sisters two wives perhaps that's why he was so keen to get off Dragonstone Aegon countered Arda luck with Quartus II he sent his own envoi requesting that princess Darden's hand be given instead to Aegon's closest friend and rumoured half-brother or as per a theum our gaelic answered with a box and a note these are the only hands your bastard shall have of me inside the box were the hands of Aegon's envoi how long had Aegon been waiting for such a pretext as his army prepared to sail Ravens flew to every great Lord of the Seven Kingdoms all bore the same message from this day forth there would be but one king in Westeros those who bent the knee to Aegon of House Targaryen would keep their lands and titles those who took up arms against him would be thrown down humbled and destroyed poor old argilac he couldn't even match Aegon in arrogance egg on landed at the mouth of the Blackwater River and raised a primitive Aegon fort in the disputed land between herons and our Galax Kingdom so that neither could decide whose problem he was adopting the customs of the Seven Kingdoms Aegon unfurled his own banner with a red three-headed dragon breathing fire upon a black field in Visenya crowned him with a ruby studded circlet of Valyrian steel while rayna's hailed him as the first High King the continent had seen since the dawn age as his lords and the gathered locals cheered him Aegon named his loyal friends to a small council led by orys baratheon whom he called my strong right hand the title stuck and a bastard became the first hand of the king but for now Aikens kingdom contained only a rocky island and a handful of fields the other Kings had larger armies ships castles and thousands of years of rule but Aegon had dragons he had chosen for the words of his house fire and blood before he was done the rivers fields and skies would turn red [Music] Aaron of house or inherited a kingdom that stretched from the Iron Islands to Detroit to great a kingdom to rule from a castle ashita spine for 40 years his Ironborn plunder the river lands for stone timber and slaves to build a seat worthy of him legend has it that Masons laid the final stone and eronel on the very day that a gun landed in Westeros could have been a diviner Olin could have been the Masons wants to [ __ ] off before the Dragons got there they were in the only ones that Aegon's approached parents river Lords revolted led by house Tully I got Heron noticed Harrenhal could repel an army of a million men no letter could summon its walls and no Ram could shatter him the castle was as impregnable as an old mates [ __ ] Heron shut his gates around himself his sons and his Ironborn and waited for a guns army to drain back into the muck when Aegon finally saw the monstrous castle he asked for parley hair and granted it malaria had been the greatest empire the world had ever seen Aaron wanted to piss on its ashes yield now and you may remain as lord of the Iron Islands yield now and your sons will live to rule after you you see my army outside your walls you see my dragons what is outside my walls is of no concern those walls are strong and thick dragons fly but stone doesn't burn when the Sun sets your line shall end parents spat and returned to his castle once inside he promised lands riches and tallest daughters to who ever could bring down a gun or his dragon as the Sun sank below the horizon all of herons men patrolled the battlements hearing wings in every gust of wind but the moon rose and sank and no dragon appeared while the Ironborn were ringing the battlements Aegon drove his dragon balerion higher and higher in the night sky so that even the great castle of Harrenhal looked like an ant hill below them then they plunged straight into the castle well inside the guarded walls the five towers of Harrenhal reached towards Aegon like a hand valerian opened his mouth and bathed all the fingers in flame Aaron was right stone doesn't burn but men do even when there are inborn the dragon blasted my ancestors into ash that choked the survivors when they screamed herons soldiers left from the battlements and died they huddled against the walls and died they fled across the yard and died Aaron and his sons took shelter inside the castle stone didn't burn but as valerian blasted it would fire it blow wide heart the world's greatest castle became the world's greatest oven baking the last of house horror within it outside the castle walls the towers of Harrenhal glowed red against the night and began to twist and melt like five huge candles with liquid stone trickling down their sides like wax the next morning Aegon forged a new Riverlands he named the rebel Edmund Tully as his Lord paramount of the Trident and had the other River Lord swear him fealty is their new leash for centuries house aura had terrorized the Riverlands under house Tully the Riverlands would at last return to peace and prosperity after the castle cooled enough to allow men inside Aegon ventured into the ruin he'd made of Harrenhal he saw the ashen bodies the scorched stone and the mangled and melted swords of his former enemies to his men's confusion he ordered these useless swords collected and sent to his Aegon fort gaun marched on Hanan hall after his coronation forest Baratheon had taken most of his forces and his queen renny's with her dragon south to deal with the excuse of the invasion argilac the arrogant king of the Stormlands argilac had his seats at storms end a castle considered the most impregnable in Westeros after Hiram hor argilac may have been arrogant but he wasn't stupid or a coward his lords advised him to shut his gates and wait out the siege but he'd heard what had happened at Harrenhal and refused to die a suckling pig cooked in his own castle he would make victory or defeat the same way with sword in hand he called his banners and marks to meet or aspera thean in the field thanks to rain as dragon mer axes or his new argilac was coming how many men he had and how fast he marched so Oris simply seized the high ground and dug in on the hills to wait for our galacto harm is approached the wind rose to meet them and the rain poured from the sky a gale which would give the battle its name the last storm king our Galax lords urged him to wait for the weather to die down but a storm king saw that the rain was blowing into the faces of the Baratheon men on their heels and our deal a card numbered the Baratheon hosts two to one with four times as many knights and heavy horse argilac attacked three times our galactus knights against the Baratheon line but the hills were steep and the rain had beat the earth to mud the war horses founded and slipped the charges collapsed the battle seemed lost until Argyll accorded his spearmen up the hill blinded by the rain the Baratheon's didn't see them until it was too late one Hill fell then another and another until only one remained in the baratheon center if our Galactic through there he could split the invading army and flank both Hoffs idolic and his men charged than the Baratheon line brother revealing Queen Rainey's and myrrh axis are Galax Vanguard burst into flame and his men panic the victory charge fell into chaos and argue like Himself was thrown from his horse but he didn't yield when orys baratheon arrived he found the old king holding off half a dozen men another half dozen dead at his feet Oris dismounted to meet the king on equal footing and offered argue like one final chance to yield argilac custom instead as the storm raged around them the grizzled old warrior and the bearded upstart forth for life and kingdom in the end foggy luck got his wish he died sword in hand as word of argyll ax death spread his lords and knights threw down their swords and fled horace and his vanguard rode to storms end to claim our deluxe castle for Aegon only to find the gates barred and the walls man argue lacks daughter had assumed his crown and the new storm queen was as fond of yielding as her father she declared that Oris would win only bones blood and ashes here but her men were weaker than her and that night orys found our Galax daughter delivered gagged chained and naked to his camp argilac had refused to give orders her hand now or as could have any part of her he wished but or his son chained the girl wrapped his cloak around her and poured her a glass of wine he told her he would take the arms banner and words of house Dehradun to honor her father's courage in the last storm conveniently Horace had none of his own to discard for the crowned stag became the sigil of house Baratheon and storms end their seat are Galax daughter would even remain in her home though as a lady instead of the princess the Stormlands were now a guns and as tribute a gun demanded the swords of the men or as had defeated for what purpose aris didn't know you hey gun now ruled two of the Seven Kingdoms but he would no longer be able to take the rest piecemeal for the first time in thousands of years the kings put aside their squabbles and joined forces against a common enemy my ancestor King Lauren of House Lannister was head of the wealthiest family in the Seven Kingdoms when King Lauren joined his forces to myrn of house gardener king of the reach they had the mightiest army in history a so-called iron fist to break the would-be Conqueror but while an iron fist can smash a man's face in battle you'd look silly hunting birds of beasts with it and Aegon had a creature that was both the kings had never even seen a dragon let alone fought one they had for each other for thousands of years and victory always went to the large rock surely a force five times that of Aegon's could manage one dragon but Aegon arrived with three still the Lannisters and Gardiner's helped for victory the battlefield they chose was a wide plain but firm ground and clear skies perfect for our chess and mounted cavalry but neither the King spared a thought for why the ground was firm there had been no rain for fortnight which meant all the weed and grass on it were bone dry perfect for dragons at first the Kings looked like they would emerge victorious the horn blew for battle their armies swept around a guns flanks and there are iron fists of mounted Knights smashed through his Center before the Dragons could even enter the fray but then Aegon and his sisters took flight and unleashed their dragons not under soldiers but on the dry fields all around them the iron fists unclasped and became a hand outstretched from us as Aegon promised he had none more than 4,000 men died in the fires another thousand escaping tens of thousands returned homeless monsters burned scarred beyond recognition House Gardner never returned at all field of fire as the singers call it claimed the last of the garden line and house Tyrell rose in their stead as laws of the reach and wardens of the south as for my illustrious ancestor when King Lawrence saw the battle was lost he rode through a wall of flame and smoke to safety or at least to a heroic capture day later when he laid his sword before Aegon and knelt Aegon tutors were had spared him and confirmed House Lannister as Lords of Casterly Rock and warden of the West why wouldn't he a Lannister always pays his debts and now we owed our lives to the crown that was worth centuries of subservience at least besides Aegon had a fetish for collecting swords not heads he added Lawrence to the pile his men had retrieved from the field of fire and sent them back to the egg and Ford you with most of the South in Agins hands the best chance to throw back the conqueror now lay with the north if we cared enough to try unlike our southern rivals the stark kings of winter didn't Forge the north into one Kingdom for glory or gold there is little of Ivor here but to survive alone in Westeros the North remembered when worse than dragon's lair waste her armies thousands of years ago the Sun set on the realms of men and the long night began a new race emerge from the ice and snow the White Walkers they demanded no crown offered no terms spared no life and the dead marched with them with humanity facing the extinction a stark sought out the children of the forest most ancient beings and Westeros and convinced them to ally with the men they once fought together the two races pushed the walkers back into the land of always winter and sealed it off in the Seven Kingdoms with the wall 300 miles of ice stone and earth rising nearly 700 feet tall to guard it they established the Nights Watch a brotherhood sworn to defend the living from the dead whose vows are raised both titles and crimes after the long night the North tried to forget it belonged to a continent perhaps through pride perhaps through sheer ignorance he never can tell with the north but his news of Aegon's dragons spread Turin star the king of winter knew he couldn't forget Westeros any longer and summoned his Lords to Winterfell many fools shrugged off the threat while the rest placed wages on how long the South would take to burn Turin silenced them with a command to assemble their armies and descend from the north in forts as the kings of the rock and the reach burned on the field of fire the greatest northern force since the long night crossed the neck into the Riverland a wanking Turin arrived at the Trident he saw in the opposing riverbank the combined strength of all a Dawn's conquered kingdoms a force larger than torrents owned by half and with three dragons that night king turin called a conference of all his lords and advisors some wanted to fight and trust northern valor to carry the day and burn on the trail the wisest of them wanted to withdraw to moat Cailin the fortress which had thrown back every southern invasion and burn their one suicidal Lord even wanted to ambush Aegon's camp in the dark and kill the dragons as they slept or at the very least their riders in hard to tell what would have been his fate of burning beheading dismemberment perhaps all three my ancestor listened to their counsel and in the morning cross the Trident and er a flag of parlay then king torrent of House Stark laid his ancient crown Aegon's feet and was named Lord of Winterfell and warden of the north and the king who knelt he had no choice and thanks to him our soldiers returned to their homes whole and unharmed the swords that egg on took from them were not twisted burnt Mangal yet the Vale of Arryn was the last of the great kingdoms left old and proud house Aaron did what they always did in times of strife they shut the bloody gate sealing off the Vale then the Queen Regent Shara of house Aaron retreated with her son the boy King Ronal into the Eyrie their family's impregnable fortress from the top of their mountain they could look down on Westeros far below its problems hidden beneath the clouds but one day Queen Sara entered the outer courtyard to find her young son sitting on the knee of visenya targaryen and ogling that dragon Vega beside her just as he'd asked for another cake at dinner beetle king Ronal asked his mother if he could go flying on the nice lady's dragon fazenda smiled and Shara so Shara imagined did Vega remembering her manners Shara asked if she could have Visenya brought some wine or food she must be tired after such a long flight but Visenya demure bored with his mother's pleasantries Ronald demanded an answer poor boy he didn't even understand the question Shara hesitated for a moment then asked for zhenya as a mother if it was safe for the boy Ksenia order it was what choice did Shara have was to son circle the castle she collected his little ringlets her own Regents coronet and the ancient Falcon crown of mountain and Vale which the Ahrens had worn for thousands of years Raoul had taken to the sky as a king but he landed as a lord perhaps he considered his ancient rites a fair trade for a few minutes of flight as a little boy would more likely he didn't even notice the three crowns at the seniors feet or recognize the swords of his garrison beside them you the heads of Westeros to Aegon but its heart still beat free old town the center of the faith of the seven there dwelt the High Septon the father of the faithful who commanded the obedience of all Westeros save the savages of the north and their old gods when Aegon had landed in Westeros the High Septon had locked himself in the starry Sept and fasted for seven days and seven nights one for each of his gods all he received for his trouble was the divine wisdom that of Oldtown took up arms against the dragon the city would burn faithful and faithless alike after the submission of House Stark Aegon marched towards old town stealing himself for another battle but he found the gates open with the High Septon welcoming him the pious fool even had the arrogance to grant what Aegon had already won and anointed the last Valyrian as Aegon of House Targaryen first of his name king of the Andals and the first men lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm as if titles meant anything to a man before whom time itself now bound the maesters would hence divide all history into before and after conquest most expected Aegon to stay and make old town his seat but soon after his coronation Aegon returned to the mouth of the Blackwater River where he had first set foot on Westeros a small town had since sprouted around his primitive fault to honor their new master the locals dubbed it King's Landing they looked more fit for a hedge Knight with wooden Palisades muddy streets and piles of mangled swords carted in from every corner of the conquest but when Aegon made it his court wood became stone black mud was buried beneath the Red Keep and the collected swords of Aegon's foes were blasted by dragon fire and became a seat fit for the Conqueror and the greatest dynasty this world has ever known House Targaryen my family my throne [Music] also it should have been but while Aegon titled himself Lord of the Seven Kingdoms in reality he held only six the seventh dawn had never knelt Visenya had flown into the Vale and returned with its crown mimicking her sister her Rhaenys had flown over the enemy force holding the passes into dawn and landed in the castle of its ruling lady Princess Marya of house Martell Maria was 80 years old fat bald and blind behind her back many sniggered at her as the yellow toad of dawn the beautiful renews probably thought as much when they met she demanded Princess Mary an eel to her brother Aegon there she allowed that um account of Maria's age and health the simple vow of submission would do that the princess told the Queen that the Targaryen weren't wanted in dawn and no Martell would ever bow bend or break no matter how badly they burned release could have mounted her dragon right then and roasted merrier in the castle as her brother had done at Harrenhal but whatever she saw in Mary's eyes scared him right back to King's Landing with a dragon's tail between its legs after Aegon's coronation reign he's returned to door with Aegon and Visenya and their dragons but now armies met them in the field and no lords defied them in their castles as the Dragons approached thorne simply emptied house Martell had learned from Harrenhal and the field of fire the dragons were unbeatable in battle that wars were more than battles unopposed Aegon claimed to own for his own but as soon as he returned to King's Landing his castles were hurled off towers and his Royal garrison vanished in the desert never to be seen again except perhaps when the wings changed in the sands cough up old bones and armor release returned on their axis intent on revenge' herself against Marian Martell but dawn was no longer empty the Dornish kept Marius promise and fought even while burning under dragon flame and they won one day above his the eye of Myr axes and knocked the dragon out of the sky house Martell remained unbroken unlike the unfortunate Rangers in their wrath Aegon and Visenya said flame to every castle and city but Sunspear trying to turn the people against house Martell but the Dornish stayed loyal and when Aegon returned to King's Landing he found assassins waiting for him in the streets of his own capital if not for Visenya the Conqueror would not have enjoyed his conquest for very long from then on the king and his family would be guarded by the seven greatest nights in the realm the Kingsguard when mariya died in his sleep a weak and tired son sued for peace but old Maria had exhausted egg on as well and he granted the request the Targaryen still wanted dawn and eventually they would have it but not at the point of a sword they would buy it the same way great Lords buy anything with a daughter when men looked up they saw Dragons Nobles learn to keep their eyes down but the gods weren't used to sharing the heavens when Aegon died the High Septon led to the faith and its army in revolt claiming that the Valyrian tradition of wedding brother to sister was an abomination in the eyes of the 7 though no one could explain where the divine mother and father had come from my ancestor make all the wise who make all the cruel as men slander him put a bounty on the head of every militant priest and miraculously the faith soon returned to the sex with Dorne in the fold and the faith could in its place none in Westeros were left to oppose my family so we started opposing each other in a dance of dragons a Targaryen princess tried to steal her brother's throne thanks to her stupidity most of our dragons died though one thankfully ate her before it did but even without our dragons we were still the blood of old Valyria which proved just as dangerous one of my foolish ancestors didn't see what separated his bastards from our family proper and legitimized them all on his deathbed adopting the name Blackfyre the bastards proved their nature and tried to seize their father's kingdom when they failed their sons tried when the sons failed their grandsons tried until finally sir Barristan the bold knight of the Kingsguard slew Malee's the monstrous in the war of the ninepenny kings ending the last of the Blackfyre line ultimately without our dragons and without blood diluted by commoners we fail to see the greatest threat growing under our noses as the saying goes every time a Targaryen is born the gods flip a coin they must have dropped the one for King Aerys but first he seemed to have dodged the family madness Braz he grew older he began to see conspirators everywhere and where there were none he worked to create them as one of his Kingsguard I saw firsthand that a king who couldn't rule his own mind couldn't rule Seven Kingdoms we endured his reign because we hoped his son Rhaegar would ride the rail when he ascended to the throne but then Rhaegar proved this matter his father and snatched Lyanna stark daughter of the warden of the north and betrothed to Robert Baratheon Lord of the Stormlands Willey Ana's father and eldest brother demanded justice the Mad King obliged lovely as a dispenser unsatisfied with only two murders the Mad King then ordered Jon Arryn lord of the Vale to execute his two wards Robert Baratheon and Eddard Stark instead Jon Arryn raised the Vale in revolt Ned Stark slipped past loyalists sentries and raised the north and Robert won three battles in a single day to unite the Stormlands behind him only to be defeated by a royalist army and forced to flee leaving his home of storms and besieged the hand of the king finally cornered Robert in the town of the Stoney Sept and sent his soldiers door-to-door searching for the rebel leader but the villagers hated the Mad King and loved Robert and kept in one step ahead of the soldiers until only one refuge remained as the soldiers closed in all the town bells rang out hearing of Robert's plight our Father and Jon Arryn had rushed to the Riverland and enlisted our grandfather 'hasta Tully to help them together they routed the Hands army and rescued Robert to celebrate and cement the Tully alliance our Father Wed our mother Catelyn and Jon Arryn took our aunt Lysa only a fortnight later both men rushed back into the field with a dragon that was finally woken well my father's servants were losing my father's kingdoms my brother Rhaegar had been cooped up with his mistress [ __ ] whatever else I'd call her a distraction but now Rhaegar came to his senses and returned to King's Landing he persuaded our Father to summon his estranged friend Lord Tywin Lannister the richest and most powerful Lord in the realm Rhaegar himself would lead the royal army against the usurper Robert on the banks of the Trident my brother fought the man whose wife he'd stolen and who fought to steal his birthright in return in the end Robert wanted it more his hammer shattered my brother's armor and it's rubies fell into the river like raindrops vanishing in the current with regards defeat nothing stood between Robert and King's Landing imagine the King's surprise a fortnight later when he saw not stags but Lions outside his gates his former hand Tywin Lannister had come to the capital with a force even Robin couldn't match claiming to be loyal to the king trusting what he wanted to believe Aerys ordered the gates opened and a Lannister forces dutifully began to rape pillage and murder the King's actual loyal subjects when Eddard Stark finally arrived at the capital with Roberts army he found Lannister banners hanging over the sacked city Targaryen corpses littering its streets and said Jaime Lannister sitting on the Iron Throne below him the Mad King Aerys whom sir Jaime had sworn to guard lay in a pool of his own blood from a sword thrust through his back Lord added might have thanked sir Jamie for doing the realm of favor but honourable as he was Lord added condemned sir Jamie as a Kingslayer a name he would never escape unlike Lord Eddard Robert appreciated my contribution to his glorious victory he pardoned me for my crime and even kept me on his Kingsguard besides sir Barristan Selmy had been wounded at the Trident fighting for Aegon true both of us had failed to protect our two garyun charges but perhaps that's what Robert liked most about us when my father presented Robert with the bodies of Rao's wife and two children Ned Stark hiked up his skirts and demanded Robert sent their killer to dawn and me to the wall but I saw what Ned couldn't Robert was ashamed of the bodies and more ashamed of his relief he knew that reyga's heirs had to die or his throne would never be safe but glorious heroes didn't kill children they simply didn't punish their murderers no doubt I would have suffered a similar fate but my father had wisely sent me in my pregnant mother to Dragonstone when the user / heroic Lee sent men to kill me and my newborn sister to protect his stolen throne a loyal Knight smuggled us across the Narrow Sea to Essos and so the last dragons of Valyria heirs to the greatest dynasty from the greatest civilization this world has ever known slept in sewers and foraged for scraps in alleyways one step ahead of the usurpers knives and one step behind the whispers of his spy master Varys but we won't run forever one day I'll return to my kingdoms with an army take back my throne and repay all traitors with the only coin my family knows fire and blood [Music] you
