 this is a book of imaginary history chronicling the Targaryen kings of Westeros it provides a context and a background for everything that happens in a song of ice and fire and it's not actually written by me it's written by archmaester Gill Dayne of the Citadel of Old Town who's a very distinguished scholar but also a somewhat idiosyncratic and crotchety old man who has strong opinions on the historical figures he's writing about so some of his views may creep into the text I don't doubt for its authenticity the targaryen were people they were good ones that were bad ones some of them were mad they were all the product of generations of incest you get people of extraordinary ability and extraordinary physical beauty which is a Targaryen hallmark they had certain physical attributes like purple eyes and silver gold hair that was much prized and was considered you know more beautiful than the run of normal men but you also get mad men or people who are troubled in one way another they were not gods they were they were people but they were people with a very particular heritage and very particular about and very bad plus it has dragons as a lot of dragons at least up through Aegon the third
