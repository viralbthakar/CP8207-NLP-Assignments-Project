 chapter 12 fire and blood heirs of the dragon a question of succession the seeds of war off planted during times of peace so it has been in westeros the bloody struggle for the iron throne known as the dance of the dragons fought from 129 to 131 ac had its roots half a century earlier during the longest and most peaceful reign that any of the conquerors descendants ever enjoyed that of jiharish the first targaryen the conciliator the old king and good queen alisain ruled together until her death in 100 ac aside from two periods of estrangement known as the first and second quarrels and produced thirteen children four of them two sons and two daughters grew to maturity married and produced children of their own never before or since had the seven kingdoms been blessed or cursed in the view of some with so many targaryen princelings from the loins of the old king and his beloved queen sprang such a confusion of claims and claimants that many maesters believe the dance of dragons or a similar struggle was inevitable this was not apparent in the early years of jaehaerys's reign for in prince eamonn and prince balon his grace had the proverbial heir and despair and seldom has the realm been blessed with two more able princes in 62ac at the age of seven eamonn was formally anointed prince of dragonstone an heir to the iron throne knighted at 17 a 20 champion at 20 he became his father's justice r and master of laws at 6 and 20. though he never served his father as hand of the king that was only because that office was occupied by septon barth the old king's most trusted friend and companion of my labors nor was balon targaryen any less accomplished the younger prince earned his knighthood at 16 and was wed at 18. though he and eamonn enjoyed a healthy rivalry no man doubted the love that bound them the succession appeared solid as stone but the stone began to crack in 92 ac when eamonn prince of dragonstone was slain on tarth by a mirish crossbow bolt loosed at the man beside him the king and the queen mourned his loss and the realm with them but no man was more bereft than prince balon who went at once the tarth and avenged his brother by driving the merman back into the sea on his return to king's landing balon was hailed as a hero by cheering throngs and embraced by his father the king who named him prince of dragonstone an heir to the iron throne it was a popular decree the small folk loved balon the brave and the lords of the realm saw him as his brother's obvious successor but prince aemon had a child his daughter rhaenys born in 74 ac had grown into a clever capable and beautiful young woman in 90 ac at the age of 17 she had wed the king's admiral and master of ships corliss of house velaryon lord of the tides known as the sea snake after the most famous of his many ships moreover princess rhaenys was with child when her father died by granting dragonstone to prince balon king jiharis was not only passing over rhaenys but also possibly her unborn son the king's decision was in accord with well-established practice aegon the conqueror had been the first lord of the seven kingdoms not his sister visenya two years his elder jiharis himself had followed his usurping uncle maegor on the iron throne though had the order of births alone ruled his sister reina had a better claim jaehaerus did not make his decision lightly he is known to have discussed the matter with his small council undoubtedly he consulted septon barth as he did on all important matters and the views of grand maester elsar were given much weight all were in accord baylon a seasoned knight of 35 was better suited for rule than 18 year old princess rainey's or her unborn babe who might or might not be a boy whereas prince balon had already sired two healthy sons viserys and damon the love of the commons for balon the brave was also cited some dissented rhaenys herself was the first to raise objection you would rob my son of his birthright she told the king with a hand upon her swollen belly her husband cordless velaryon was so roth that he gave up his admiralty and his place on the small council and took his wife back to driftmark lady jocelyn of house baratheon rainey's mother was also angered as was her formidable brother bormand lord of storm's end the most prominent dissenter was good queen alsain who had helped her husband rule the seven kingdoms for many years and now saw her son's daughter being passed over because of her sex a ruler needs a good head and a true heart she famously told the king a is not essential if your grace truly believes that women lack the wit to rule plainly you have no further need of me and thus queen alsane departed king's landing and flew to dragonstone on her dragon silver wing she and king jiharis remained apart for two years the period of estrangement recorded in the histories as the second quarrel the old king and the good queen were again reconciled in 94 ac by the good offices of their daughter septimigal but never reached the accord on the succession the queen died of a wasting illness in 100 ac at the age of 4 and 60 still insisting that her granddaughter rhaenys and her children had been unfairly cheated of their rights the boy in the belly the unborn child who had been the subject of so much debate proved to be a girl when born in 93 ac her mother named her elena the next year rhaenys gave her a brother lenore prince balon was firmly as sconced as heir apparent by then yet has valerian and house baratheon clung to the belief that young lenore had a better claim to the iron throne and some few even argued for the rights of the elder sister lena and their mother rhaenys in the last years of her life the gods dealt queen alisaine many cruel blows as previously had been recounted her grace knew joys as well as sorrows during the same years however chief amongst them her grandchildren there were weddings as well in 93 ac she attended the wedding of prince baelon's eldest son viserys to lady emma of house aaron the 11 year old child of the late princess dialla their marriage was not consummated until the bride had flowered two years later in 97 the good queen saw balon's second son damon take to wife lady rhea of house royce heir to the ancient castle of runestone in the vale the great tourney held at king's landing in 98 ac to celebrate the 50th year of king jaharis's reign surely gladdened the queen's heart as well for most of her surviving children grandchildren and great-grandchildren returned to share in the feasts and celebrations not since the doom of valyria had so many dragons been seen in one place at a time it was truly said the final tilt wherein the kingsguard members sarim redwine and sir clement krabb broke 30 lances against each other before king jaharis proclaimed them co-champions was declared to be the finest display of jousting ever seen in westeros a fortnight after the tourney's end however the king's old friend septon barth died peacefully in his sleep after serving abele as hand of the king for 41 years jiharis chose the lord commander of his kingsguard to take his place but sir ryan redwine was no sept in barth and his undoubted prowess with a lance proved little use to him as hand some problems cannot be solved by hitting them with a stick grand maester alar famously observed his grace had no choice but to remove sir ryam after only a year in office he turned to his son balon to replace him and in 99 ac the prince of dragonstone became the king's hand as well he performed his duties admirably though less scholarly than septon barth the prince proved a good judge of men and surrounded himself with loyal subordinates and counselors the realm would be well ruled when balon targaryen sat the iron throne lords and common folk agreed it was not to be in 101 ac prince balon complained of a snitch in his side whilst hunting in the king's wood the pain worsened when he returned to the city his belly swelled and hearted and the pain grew so severe it left him bedridden runciter the new grand maester only recently arrived from the citadel after alar was felled by a stroke was able to bring the prince's fever down somewhat and give him some relief from the acne with milk of the poppy but his condition continued to worsen on the fifth day of his illness prince balon died in his bed chamber in the tower of the hand with his father sitting beside him holding his hand after opening the corpse grand maester runciter put down the cause of death as a burst belly all the seven kingdoms wept for brave balon and none more so than jiharis this time when he lit his son's funeral pyre he did not even have the comfort of his beloved wife beside him the old king had never been so alone and now again his grace faced a nettlesome dilemma for once more the succession was in doubt with both of the heirs apparent dead and burned there was no longer a clear successor to the iron throne but that was not to say there was any lack of claimants balon had sired three sons by his sister alyssa two viserys and damon still lived had baylon ever taken the iron throne viserys would have followed him without question but the crown prince's tragic death at the age of 4 and 40 muddied the succession the claims of princess rainey's and her daughter laina velaryon were put forward once again and even if they were to be passed over on account of their sex rainey's son lenore faced no such impediment laenor velaryon was male and could claim dissent from jaehaerys's elder son whilst baylon's boys were descended from the younger moreover king jiharis still had one surviving son vegon an archmaester at the citadel holder of the ring and rod and mask of yellow gold known to history as vegon the dragonless his very existence had been largely forgotten by most of the seven kingdoms though only 40 years of age wagon was pale and frail a bookish man devoted to alchemy astronomy mathematics and other arcane arts even as a boy he had never been well liked few considered him a viable choice to sit the iron throne and yet it was to arch mr vagon that the old king turned now summoning his last son to king's landing what passed between them remains a matter of dispute some say the king offered vegan the throne and was refused others assert that he only sought his counsel reports had reached the court that corless valerion was massing ships and men on driftmark to defend the rights of his son lenore whilst damon targaryen a hot-tempered and quarrelsome young man of 20 had gathered his own band of sworn swords in support of his brother viserys a violent struggle for succession was likely no matter who the old king named to succeed him no doubt that was why his grace seized eagerly on the solution offered by archmaester vegan king jiharist announced his intent to convene a great council to discuss debate and ultimately decide the matter of succession all the great and lesser lords of westeros would be invited to attend together with maesters from the citadel of old town and septa and septons to speak for the faith let the claimants make their case before the assembled lords his grace decreed he would abide by the council's decision whomever they might choose it was decided that the council would be held at harrenhal the largest castle in the realm no one knew how many lords would come since no such council had ever been held before but it was thought prudent to have room for at least 500 lords and their tales more than a thousand lords attended it took half a year to assemble them a few arrived even as the council was breaking up even haurenhall could not contain such multitudes for each lord was accompanied by a retinue of knights squires grooms cooks and serving men time in lannister lord of casterly rock brought 300 men with him not to be outdone lord mathos tyrell of highgarden brought 500 lords came from every corner of the realm from the dornish marches to the shadow of the wall from the three sisters to the iron islands the even star of tarth was there and the lord of the lonely light from winterfell came lord ellard stark from riverrun lord grover tully from the vale yorbert royce regent and protector for the young jane aaron lady of the eerie even the dornish men were represented the prince of dorne sent his daughter and 20 dornishmen to harrenhal as observers the high septon came from old town to bless the assembly merchants and tradesmen descended upon harrenhal by the hundreds hedge knights and free riders came in hopes of finding work for their swords cut purses came seeking after coin old women and young girls came seeking after husbands thieves and washer women and camp followers singers and mummers they came from east and west and north and south a city of tents sprang up outside the walls of harrenhal and along the lakeshore for leagues in each direction for a time harrington was the fourth city in the realm only old town king's landing and lannisport were larger no fewer than 14 claims were duly examined and considered by the lords assembled from essos came three rival competitors grandsons of king jiharis through his daughter sarah each sired by a different father one was said to be the very image of his grandsire in his youth another a bastard born to a triarch of old volantis arrived with bags of gold and a dwarf elephant the lavish gifts he distributed amongst the poor lords undoubtedly helped his claim the elephant proved less useful princess sarah herself was still alive and well in volantis in only 34 years of age her own claim was clearly superior to those of any of her bastard sons but she did not choose to press it i have my own kingdom here she said when asked if she meant to return to westeros another contestant produced sheafs of parchment that demonstrated his descent from game in the glorious the greatest of the targaryen lords of dragonstone before the conquest by way of a younger daughter and the petty lord she had married and on for seven further generations there was a well-strapping red-haired man at arms who claimed to be a bastard son of megor the cruel by way of proof he brought his mother an aged innkeeper's daughter who had said that she had once been raped by maegor the lords were prepared to believe the fact of rape but not that the act had gotten her with a child the great council deliberated for 13 days the tenuous claims of nine lesser competitors were considered and discarded one such a hedge knight who put himself forward as a natural son of king jeharis himself was seized and imprisoned when the king exposed him as a liar archmister vegan was ruled out on a count of his vows and princess rhaenys and her daughter on account of their sex leaving the two claimants with the most support viceros targaryen eldest son of prince balon and princess alissa and lenore velaryon the son of princess rainey's and grandson of prince aemon viserys was the old king's grandson lenore his great-grandson the principle of primogeniture favored lenore the principle of proximity viserys viserys had also been the last targaryen to ride belarion though after the death of the black dread in 94 ac he never mounted in another dragon whereas the boy laner had yet to take his first flight upon his young dragon a splendid gray and white beast named sea smoke but facers claim derived from his father lanors from his mother and most lords felt that the male line must take precedence over the female moreover viserys was a man of 24 lanor a boy of seven for all of these reasons lenore's claim was generally regarded as the weaker but the boy's mother and father were such powerful and influential figures that it could not be dismissed entirely mayhaps this would be a good place to add a few additional words about his sire corliss of house valerion lord of the tides and master of driftmark renowned in a song and story as the sea snake and surely one of the most extraordinary figures of the age a noble house with a storied valyrian lineage the velaryons had come to westeros even before the targaryens if their family histories can be believed settling in the gullet on the low-lying and fertile island of driftmark so named for the driftwood that the tides brought daily to its shores rather than its stony smoking neighbor dragonstone though never dragon riders the valerians had for centuries remain the oldest and closest allies of the targaryens the sea was their element not the sky during the conquest it was valyrian ships that carried aegon's soldiers across blackwater bay and later formed the greater part of the royal fleet throughout the first century of targaryen rule so many lords of the tides served on the small council as master of ships that the office was widely seen as almost hereditary yet even with such forebears corliss valerion was a man apart a man as brilliant as he was restless as adventurous as he was ambitious it was traditional for the sons of the seahorse the sigil of house valerion to be given a taste of a seafarer's life when young but no velaryon before or since ever took the shipboard life as eagerly as the boy who'd become the sea snake he first crossed the narrow sea the age of six sailing to pentos with an uncle thereafter corliss made such voyages every year nor did he travel as a passenger he climbed mass tied knots scrubbed decks pulled oars caulked leaks raised and lowered sails manned the crow's nest learned to navigate and steer his captain said they had never seen such a natural sailor at age 16 he became a captain himself taking a fishing boat called the cod queen from driftmark to dragonstone and back in the years that followed his ships grew larger and swifter his voyages longer and even more dangerous he took ships from around the bottom of westeros to visit old town lannisport and lordsport on pike he sailed to lis tyrosh pentos and mir he took the summer maid to volantis and the summer isles and the ice wolf north to braavos east watch by the sea and hardhome before turning into the shivering sea for lorath and the port of eben on a later voyage he and the ice wolf headed north once more searching for a rumored passage around the top of westeros but finding only frozen seas and icebergs big as mountains his most famous voyages were those where he made on the ship that he designed and built himself the sea snake traders from old town and the arbor off sailed as far as qarth in search of spice silk and other treasures but cordless valerian and the sea snake were the first to go beyond passing through the jade gates to yiti and the isle of lange returning with such a load of silk and spice that he doubled his wealth of house velaryon in a stroke on his second voyage in the sea snake he sailed even farther to asshai by the shadow on his third he tried the shivering sea instead becoming the first westerosi to navigate the thousand islands and visit the bleak cold shores of nagai and masavi in the end the sea snake made nine voyages on the ninth sir corliss took her back to qarth laden with enough gold to buy 20 more ships and load them all with saffron pepper nutmeg elephants and bolts of the finest silk only 14 of the fleet arrived safely at driftmark and all the elephants died at sea yet even so the profits from the voyage were so vast that the valyrians became the wealthiest house in the seven kingdoms eclipsing even the hightowers and lannisters albeit briefly this wealth circles put to good use when his aged grandsire died at the age of eight and eighty and the sea snake became lord of the tide the seat of house valerian was castle driftmark a dark grim place always damp and often flooded lord corliss raised a newcastle on the far side of the island high tide was built of the same pale stone as the eerie its slender towers crowned with roofs of beaten silver that flashed in the sun when the morning and evening tides rolled in the castle was surrounded by the sea connected to driftmark proper only by a causeway to this new castle lord corliss moved the ancient driftwood throne a gift from the merlin king according to legend the sea snake built ships as well the royal fleet tripled in size during the years he served the old king as master of ships even after giving up that office he continued to build turning out merchantmen and trading galleys in place of warships beneath the dark salt stained walls of castle driftmark three modest fishing villages grew together in a thriving town called hull for the rows of ship hulls that could always be seen below the castle across the island near high tide another village was transformed into spice town its wharves and peers crowded with ships from the free cities and beyond sitting a thwart the gullet driftmark was closer to the narrow sea than duskendale or king's landing so spicetown soon began to usurp much of the shipping that would elsewise have made for those parts and house valarion grew even richer and more powerful lord corliss was an ambitious man during his nine voyages on the sea snake he was forever wanting to press onward to go where none had gone before and see what lay beyond the maps though he had accomplished much and more in life he was seldom satisfied the men who knew him best would say in rainey's targaryen daughter of the old king's eldest son and heir he had found his perfect match a woman as spirited and beautiful and proud as any in the realm and a dragon rider as well his sons and daughters would soar through the skies lord corliss expected and one day one of them would sit the iron throne unsurprisingly the sea snake was bitterly disappointed when prince eamonn died and king jeharis bypassed eamon's daughter rhaenys in favor of his brother baylon the spring prince but now it seemed the wheel had turned again and the wrong could be righted thus did lord corliss and his wife the princess rhaenys arrive at harrenhal in high state using the wealth and influence of house velaryon to persuade the lords assembled that their son lenore should be recognized as heir to the iron throne in these efforts they were joined by the lord of storm's end borman baratheon great uncle to rhaenys and great great uncle to the boy lanor by lord stark of winterfell lord manderly of white harbor lord dustin of baroton lord blackwood of raventree lured barr emin of sharppoint lord keltegar of claw isle and more they were nowhere near enough though lord and lady valerion were eloquent and open-handed in their efforts on behalf of their son the decision of the great council was never truly in doubt by a lopsided margin the lords assembled chose viserys targaryen as the rightful heir to the iron throne though the maesters who tally the votes never revealed the actual numbers it was said afterward that the vote had been more than twenty to one king jeharis had not attended the council but when word of their verdict reached him his grace thanked the lords for their service and gratefully conferred the style prince of dragonstone upon his grandson viserys storm's end and driftmark accepted the decision if grudgingly the vote had been so overwhelming that even laenor's father and mother saw that they could not hope to prevail in the eyes of many the great council of 101ac thereby established an iron precedent on matters of succession regardless of seniority the iron throne of westeros could not pass to a woman nor through a woman to her male descendants of the last years in the reign of king jiharis little and less need be said prince balon had served his father as hand of the king as well as prince of dragonstone but after his death his grace elected to divide those honors as his new hand he called upon sir otto hightower younger brother to lord hightower of old town sir otto brought his wife and children to court with him and served king jiharis faithfully for the years remaining to him as the old king's strength and wits began to fail he was off confined to his bed sir otto's precocious 15 year old daughter alison became his constant companion fetching his grace his meals reading to him helping him to bathe and dress himself the old king sometimes mistook her for one of his daughters calling her by their names near the end he grew certain she was his daughter sarah returned to him from beyond the narrow sea in the year 103 ac king jeharsh the first targaryen died in his bed as lady allison was reading to him from septon barth's unnatural history his grace was 9 and 60 years of age and had reigned over the seven kingdoms since coming to the iron throne at the age of fourteen his remains were buried in the dragon pit his ashes interred with good queen alisanes on dragonstone all of westeros mourned even in dorne where his writ had not extended men wept and women tore their garments in accordance with his own wishes and the decision of the great council of 101 his grandson visera succeeded him mounting the iron throne as king viserys the first targaryen at the time of his ascent king viserys was 26 years old he had been married for a decade to a cousin lady emma of house aaron herself a granddaughter of the old king and good queen alisain through her mother the late princess daela lady ema had suffered several miscarriages and the death of one son in the cradle over the course of her marriage some maesters felt she had been married and bedded too young but she had also given birth to a healthy daughter renera born 97 ac the new king and his queen both doted on the girl their only living child many consider the reign of king viserys the first to represent the apex of targaryen power in westeros beyond a doubt there were more lords and princes claiming the blood of the dragon than at any period before or since though the targaryens had continued their traditional practice of marrying brother to sister uncle denise and cousin a cousin wherever possible there had also been important matches outside of the royal family the fruit of which would play important roles in the war to come there were more dragons than ever before as well and several of the she-dragons were regularly producing clutches of eggs not all of the dragon eggs hatched but many did and it became customary for the fathers and mothers of newborn princelings to place a dragon's egg in their cradles following the tradition of princess reyna had begun many years before the children so blessed invariably bonded with the hatchlings to become dragon riders viserys the first targaryen had a generous amiable nature and was well loved by his lords and small folk alike the young king as the commons called him upon his ascent was peaceful and prosperous his grace's open-handedness was legendary and the red key became a place of song and splendor king viserys and queen emma hosted many a feast in tourney and lavish gold offices and honors on their favorites at the center of the merriment cherished and adored by all was their only surviving child princess rhaenyra the little girl at court singers dubbed the realms delight though only six when her father came to the iron throne rhaenyra targaryen was a precocious child bright and bold and beautiful as only one of dragon's blood can be beautiful at seven she became a dragon rider taking to the sky on the young dragon she named cerax after a goddess of old valyria at eight the princess was placed into service as a cupbearer but for her own father the king at table at tourney and at court king viserys thereafter was seldom seen without his daughter by his side meanwhile the tedium of rule was left largely to the king's small council and his hand sir otto hightower had continued in that office serving the grandson as he had the grandsire an evil man all agreed though many found him proud brusk and haughty the longer he served the more imperious sir otto became it was said and many great lords and princes came to resent his manner and envy him his access to the iron throne the greatest of his rivals was daemon targaryen the king's ambitious impetuous moody younger brother as charming as he was hot-tempered prince damon had earned his night's spurs at 6 and 10 and had been given dark sister by the old king himself in recognition of his prowess though he had wed the lady of runestone in 97ac during the old king's reign the marriage had not been a success prince damon found the veil of aaron boring in the veil of aaron the men sheep he wrote you cannot fault them their sheep are prettier than the women and soon developed a mislike of his lady wife whom he called my bronze after the runic bronze armor worn by the lords of house royce upon the accession of his brother to the iron throne the prince petitioned to have his marriage set aside viserys denied the request but did allow damon to return to court where he sat on the small council serving as master of coin from 103 to 104 and master of laws for half a year in 104. governance bored this warrior prince however he did better when king viserys made him commander of the city watch finding the watchmen ill-armed and clad in ottomans and rags damon equipped each man with dirk short sword and cudgel armored them in black ring mail with breast plates for the officers and gave them long golden cloaks that they might wear with pride ever since the men of the city watch have been known as gold cloaks prince damon took eagerly to the work of the gold cloaks and off-prowled the alleys of king's landing with his men that he made the city more orderly no man could doubt but his discipline was a brutal one he delighted in cutting off the hands of pickpockets gelding rapists and slitting the noses of thieves and slew three men in street brawls during his first year as commander before long the prince was well known in all the low places of king's landing he became a familiar site in wine sinks where he drank for free and gambling pits where he always left with more coin than he entered though he sampled countless in the city's brothels and was said to have in a special fondness for deflowering maidens a certain lyceni dancing girl soon became his favorite mysaria was the name she went by though her rivals and enemies called her misery the white worm as king viserys had no living son damon regarded himself as the rightful heir to the iron throne and coveted the title of prince of dragonstone which his grace refused to grant him but by the end of the year 185 ac he was known to his friends as the prince of the city and to the small folk as lord flea bottom though the king did not wish damon to succeed him he remained fond of his younger brother and was quick to forgive his many offences princess rhaenyra was also enamored of her uncle for damon was ever attentive to her whenever he crossed the narrow sea upon his dragon he brought her some exotic gift on his return the king had grown soft and plump over the years viserys never claimed another dragon after belirion's death nor did he have much taste for the joust the hunt or swordplay whereas prince damon excelled in these fears and seemed all that his brother was not lean and hard a renowned warrior dashing daring more than a little dangerous and here we must digress to say a word about our sources for much of what happened in the years that followed behind closed doors in the privacy of stairwells council rooms and bed chambers and the full truth of it will likely never be known we have of course the chronicles laid down by grand maester runcider and his successors but many a court document as well all the royal decrees and proclamations but these only tell a small part of the story for the rest we must look to accounts written decades later by the children and grandchildren of those caught up in the events of these times lords and knights reporting events witnessed by their forebears third-hand recollections of aged serving men relating the scandals of their youth whilst these are undoubtedly of use so much time passed between the events and the recording that many confusions and contradictions have inevitably crept in nor do these remembrances always agree unfortunately this is also true of the two accounts by first-hand observers that have come down to us septon eustis who served in the royal sept in the red keep during much of this time and later rose to the ranks of the most devout set down the most detailed history of this period as a confidant and confessor to king viserys and his queens eustis was well placed to know much and more of what went on nor was he reticent about recording even the most shocking and salacious rumors and accusations though the bulk of the reign of king viserys first of his name the dance of the dragons that came after remains a sober and somewhat ponderous history to balance eustis we have the testimony of mushroom based upon the verbal account of the court fool set down by a scribe who failed to append his name who at various times capered for the amusement of king viserys prince rhaenyra and both aegons the second and third a three foot tall dwarf possessed of an enormous head and he of errors an even more enormous member mushroom was thought feeble-minded so kings and lords and princes did not scruple to hide their secrets from him whereas septon eustis records the secrets of bedchamber and brothel and hushed condemnatory tones mushroom delights in the same and his testimony consists of little but rival tales and gossip piling stabbings poisonings betrayals seductions and debaucheries one atop the other how much of this can be believed as a question the honest historian cannot hope to answer but it is worth noting that king balor the blessed decreed that every copy of mushroom's chronicle should be burned fortunately for us a few escaped his fires septon eustis and mushroom do not always agree upon particulars and at times their accounts are considerably at variance with one another and with the court records and the chronicles of grand maester runciter and his successors yet their tales do explain much and more that might otherwise seem puzzling and later accounts confirm enough of their stories to suggest that they contain at least some portion of truth the question of what to believe and what to doubt remains for each student to decide on one point mushroom septon eustis grand maester runciter and all our other sources concur sir otto hightower the king's hand took a great dislike to the king's brother it was sir otto who convinced viserys to remove prince damon as master of coin and then as master of laws actions the hands soon came to regret as commander of the city watch with two thousand men under his command damon waxed more powerful than ever on no account can prince damon be allowed to ascend to the iron throne the hand wrote his brother lord of old town he would be a second maegor the cruel or worse it was sir otto's wish then that princess rhaenyra succeeded her father better the realms delight then lord flee bottom he wrote nor was he alone in his opinion yet his party faced a formidable hurdle if the precedent set by the great council of 101 was followed a male claimant must prevail over a female in the absence of a true born son the king's brother would come before the king's daughter as balon had come before rhaenys in 92 ac as for the king's own views all the chronicles agree that king viserys hated dissension though far from blind to his brother's flaws he cherished his memories of the free-spirited adventurous boy that damon had been his daughter was his life's great joy he often said but a brother is a brother time and time again he strove to make peace between prince damon and sir otto but the enmity between the two men roiled endlessly beneath the false smiles they wore at court when pressed upon the matter king viserys would only say that he was certain his queen would soon present him with a son and at 105 ac he announced to the court and small council that queen emma was once again with child during that same fateful year sir christian cole was appointed to the kingsguard to fill the place created by the death of the legendary sariaum redwine born the son of a steward in service to lord dondarian of blackhaven so christian was a calmly young knight of three and twenty years he first came to the attention of the court when he won the melee held at maidenpool in honor of king viserys's ascension in the final moments of the fight sir christian knocked dark sister from prince damian's hand with his morning star to the delight of his grace and the fury of the prince afterward he gave the seven-year-old princess rhaenyra the victor's laurel and begged for her favor to wear in the joust in the lists he defeated prince damon once again and unhorsed both of the celebrated cargill twins sir eric and sir eric of the kingsguard before falling to lord lymon mallister with his pale green eyes cold black hair and easy charm cole soon became a favorite of all the ladies at court not the least amongst them rhaenyra targaryen herself so smitten was she by the charms of a man she called my white knight that rhaenyra begged her father to name sir christian cole her own personal shield and protector his grace indulged her in this as in so much else thereafter sir christian always wore her favor in the lists and became a fixture at her side during feasts and frolics not long after sir christian donned his white cloak king viserys invited lionel strong lord of harrenhal to join the small council as master of laws a big man burly and balding lord strong enjoyed a formidable reputation as a battler those who did not know him off took him for a brood mistaking his silences and slowness of speech for stupidity this was far from the truth lord lionel had studied at the citadel as a youth earning six links of his chain before deciding that a maester's life was not for him he was literate and learned his knowledge of the laws of the seven kingdoms exhaustive thrice wed and thrice a widower the lord of harrenhal brought two maiden daughters and two sons to court with him the girls became handmaids to princess rhaenyra whilst their elder brother sir harwin strong called break bones was made a captain in the gold cloaks the younger boy larys the clubfoot joined the king's confessors thus did matters stand in king's landing late in the year 105 ac when queen ema was brought to bed in maegor's holdfast and died whilst giving birth to the son that viserys targaryen had desired for so long the boy named balon after the king's father survived her only by a day leaving king and court bereft save perhaps for prince damon who was observed in a brothel on the street of silk making drunken japes with his highborne cronies about their effort a day when word of this got back to the king legend says that it was the horse sitting in damon's lap who informed on him but evidence suggests it was actually one of his drinking companions a captain in the gold cloaks eager for advancement viserys became livid his grace had finally had a surfeit of his ungrateful brother and his ambitions once his mourning for his wife and son had run its course the king moved swiftly to resolve the long siberian issue of succession disregarding the precedent set by king jiharis in 92 in the great council in 101 viserys declared his daughter rhaenyra to be the rightful heir and named her princess of dragonstone in a lavish ceremony at king's landing hundreds of lords did obeisance to the realm's delight as she sat at her father's feet at the base of the iron throne swearing to honor and defend her right of succession prince damon was not amongst them however furious at the king's decree the prince quit king's landing resigning from the city watch he went first to dragonstone taking his paramour mysaria with him upon the back of his dragon caraxies the lean red beast the small folk called the blood worm there he remained for half a year during which time he got myseria with child when he learned that his concubine was pregnant prince damon presented her with the dragon's egg but in this he again went too far and woke his brother's wrath king viserys commanded him to return the egg send his away and return to his lawful wife or else be attained as a traitor the prince obeyed though with ill grace dispatching mysaria eggless back to lease whilst he himself flew to runestone in the veil and the unwelcome company of his bron but maiseria lost her child during a storm on the narrow sea when word reached prince damon he spoke no syllable of grief but his heart hardened against the king his brother thereafter he spoke of king viserys only with disdain and began to brood day and night on the succession though princess rhaenyra had been proclaimed her father's successor there were many in the realm at court and beyond it who still hoped that viserys might father a male heir for the young king was not yet 30. grand maester runcider was the first to urge his grace to remarry even suggesting a suitable choice the lady lena valerion who had just turned 12. a fiery young maiden freshly flowered lady elena had inherited the beauty of a true targaryen from her mother rhaenys and a bold adventure spirit from her father the sea snake as lord corliss loved to sail laina loved to fly and had claimed for her own no less amount than mighty veigar the oldest and largest of the targaryen dragons since the passing of the black dread in 94 ac by taking the girl to wife the king could heal the rift that had grown up between the iron throne and driftmark runciter pointed out and laina would surely make a splendid queen viserys the first targaryen was not the strongest world of kings it must be said always amiable and anxious to please he relied greatly on the council of the men around him and did as they bade more often not in this instance however his grace had his own notion and no amount of argument would sway him from his course he would marry again yes but not to a 12 year old girl and not for reasons of state another woman had caught his eye he announced his intentions to wed lady alicent of house hightower the clever and lovely 18 year old daughter of the king's hand the girl who had read to king jiharis as he lay dying the high towers of old town were an ancient and noble family of impeccable lineage there could be no possible objection to the king's choice of bride even so there were those who murmured that the hand had risen above himself and that he had brought his daughter to court with this in mind a few even cast doubt on lady allison's virtue suggesting she had welcomed king viserys into her bed even before queen ama's death these calmness were never proved though mushroom repeats them in his testimony and goes as far as to claim that reading was not the only service lady allison performed for the old king in his bedchamber in the veil prince damon reportedly whipped the serving man who brought the news to him with an inch of his life nor was the sea snake pleased when word reached driftmark house valerian had been passed over once again his daughter elena scorned just as his son lenore had been scorned by the great council and his wife by the old king back in 92 ac only lady lana herself seemed untroubled her lady ship shows far more interest in flying than in boys the maester at high tide wrote to the citadel when king viserys took allison hightower to wife in 106 ac house velaryon was notable for its absence princess rhaenyra poured for her stepmother at the feast and queen allison kissed her and named her daughter the princess was amongst the women who disrobed the king and delivered him to the bedchamber of his bride laughter and love ruled the red keep that night whilst across the blackwater bay lord corliss the sea snake welcomed the king's brother prince damon to a war council the prince had suffered all he could stand to the veil of aaron runestone and his lady wife dark's sister was made for noble attacks then slaughtering sheep he is reported to have told the lord of the tides she has thirst for blood but it was not rebellion that the prince had in mind he saw another path to power the stepstones the chain of rocky islands between dorne and the disputed lands of essos had long been a haunt of outlaws exiles wreckers and pirates of themselves the isles were of little worth but placed as they were they controlled the sea lanes to and from the narrow sea and merchant ships passing through those waters were often preyed on by their inhabitants still for centuries such depredations had remained no more than a nuisance ten years earlier however the free cities of lis mir and tyrosh had put aside their ancient enmities to make common cause in a war against volantis after defeating the valentines in the battle of the borderlands the three victorious cities had entered into an internal alliance and formed a strong new power the triarchy better known in westeros as the kingdom of the three daughters as each of the free cities considered itself a daughter of valyria of old or more rudely the kingdom of the three though this kingdom was without a king being governed by a council of 38 manchesters once volantis sued for peace and withdrew from the disputed lands the three daughters had turned their gaze westward sweeping over the stepstones with their combined armies and fleets under the command of the mirsh prince admiral cragus drachar who earned the super k kragus crab feeder when he staked out hundreds of captured pirates on the wet sands to drown beneath the rising tide the conquest and annexation of the stepstones by the kingdom of the three daughters at first met with only approval from the lords of westeros order had replaced chaos and if the three daughters demanded a toll of any ship passing through their waters that deemed a small price to pay to be rid of the pirates the avarice of cragus crabfeeder and his partners in conquest soon turned feelings against them however the toll was raised again and yet again soon becoming so ruinous that merchants who had once paid gladly now sought to slip past the galleys of the triarchy as once they had as pirates drahar and his lycenia and tairoshi co-admirals seemed to be vying with each other to see who was the greediest men complained the lycini became especially loathed for they claimed more than coin from passing ships taking off women girls and comely young boys to serve in their pleasure gardens and pillow houses amongst those thus enslaved was lady johanna swann a 15-year-old niece of the lord of stonehelm when her infamously negardly uncle refused to pay the ransom she was sold to a pillow house where she rose to become the celebrated courtesan known as the black swan and ruler of elise in all but name alas her tale however fascinating has no bearing upon our present history of all the lords of westeros none suffered so much from these practices as corliss velaryon lord of the tides whose fleets had made him a wealthy and powerful as any man in the seven kingdoms the sea snake was determined to put an end to the triarchy's rule over the stepstones and in damon targaryen he found a willing partner eager for the gold and glory that victory and war would bring him shunning the king's wedding they laid their plans in high tide on the isle driftmark lord valerion would command the fleet prince damon the army they would be greatly outnumbered by the forces of the three daughters but the prince would also bring to battle the fires of his dragon karaxis the blood worm it is not our purpose here to recount the details of the private ward damon targaryen and corliss velaryon waged on the stepstones suffice it to say that the fighting began in 106 ac prince damon had little difficulty assembling an army of landless adventurers and second sons and won many victories during the first two years of the conflict in 108 ac when at least he came face to face with cragus crab feeder he slew him single-handed and cut off his head with dark sister king viserys doubtless pleased to be rid of his troublesome brother supported his efforts with regular infusions of gold and by 109 ac damon targaryen and his army of cell swords and cutthroats controlled all but two of the islands and the sea snake's fleets had taken firm control of the waters between during this brief moment of victory prince damon declared himself king of the stepstones in the narrow sea and lord corliss placed a crown upon his head but their kingdom was far from secure the next year the kingdom of the three daughters dispatched a fresh invasion force under the command of a devious tairoshi captain named ricalio rendun surely one of the most curious and flamboyant rogues in the annals of history and dorne joined the war in alliance with the triarchy fighting resumed though the stepstones were engulfed in blood and fire king viserys in his court remained unperturbed let daemon play at war his grace is reported to have said it keeps him out of trouble viserys was a man of peace and during these years king's landing was an endless round of feasts balls and tourneys where mummers and singers heralded the birth of each new targaryen princeling queen nelson had soon proved to be as fertile as she was pretty in 107 ac she bore the king a healthy son naming him aegon after the conqueror two years later she produced a daughter for the king helena in 110 ac she bore him a second son eamond who is said to be half the size of his elder brother but twice as fierce yet princess rhaenyra continued to sit at the foot of the iron throne when her father held court and his grace began bringing her to meetings of the small council as well though many lords and knights sought her favor the princess had eyes only vs christian cole the young champion of the kingsguard and her constant companion so christian protects the princess from her enemies but who protects the princess from so christian queen allison asked one day a court the aminy between her grace and her stepdaughter had proved short-lived for both rhaenyra and alison aspired to be the first lady of the realm and though the queen had given the king not one but two male heirs viserys had done nothing to change the order of succession the princess of dragonstone remained his acknowledged heir with half the lords of westeros sworn to defend her rights those who asked what of the ruling of the great council of 101 found the words falling on deaf ears the matter had been decided so as far as king viserys was concerned it was not an issue his grace care to revisit still questions persisted not the least from queen ellison herself loudest amongst her supporters was her father sir otto hightower hand of the king pushed too far on the matter in 109 hc viserys stripped sir otto of his chain of office and named in his place the taxitarian lord of harrenhal lionel strong this hand will not hector me his grace proclaimed even after sir otto had returned to old town a queen's party still existed at court a group of powerful lords friendly to queen alison's and supportive of the rights of her sons against them was pitted the party of the princess king viserys loved both his wife and daughter and hated conflict and contention he strove all his days to keep the peace between his women and to please both with gifts and gold and honors so as long as he lived and ruled and kept the balance the feasts and tourneys continued as before and peace prevailed throughout the realm though there were some sharp-eyed who observed the dragons of one party snapping and spitting flame at the dragons of the other party whenever they chance to pass near each other in 111ac a great tourney was held at king's landing on the 5th anniversary of the king's marriage to queen alcent at the opening feast the queen wore a green gown whilst the princess dressed dramatically in targaryen red and black note was taken and thereafter it became custom to refer to greens and blacks when talking of the queen's party and the party of the princess respectively in the tourney itself the blacks had a much better of it when sir christian cole wearing princess rainier's favor unhorsed all of the queen's champions including two of her cousins and her youngest brother sir wayne hightower yet there was one there who wore neither green nor black but rather gold and silver prince damon had at last returned to court wearing a crown and styling himself the king of the narrow sea he appeared unannounced in the skies above king's landing on his dragon circling there above the turny grounds but when at last he came to earth he knelt before his brother and offered up his crown as a token of his love and fealty becerrus returned the crown and kissed damon on both cheeks welcoming him home and the lords and commons set up a thunderous cheer as the sons of the spring prince were reconciled amongst those cheering loudest was princess rhaenyra who was thrilled at the return of her favorite uncle and begged him to stay a while this much is known as to what happened afterward here we must look at our more dubious chroniclers prince damon did remain at king's landing for half a year that is beyond dispute he even resumed his seat on the small council according to grand maester munster but neither age nor exile had changed his nature damon soon took up again with old companions from the gold cloaks and returned to the establishments along the street of silk where he had been such a valued patron though he treated queen alicent with all the courtesy to her station there was no warmth between them and men said that the prince was notably cool towards her children especially his nephews again and eamond whose birth had pushed him still lower in the order of succession princess rhaenyra was a different matter damon spent long hours in her company enthralling her with tales of his journeys and battles he gave her pearls and silks and books and a jade tiara said once to have belonged to the empress of lange read poems to her dined with her hawked with her sailed with her entertained her by making mock of the greens at court the lick spittles fawning over queen allison and her children he praised her beauty declaring her to be the fairest maid in all the seven kingdoms uncle and niece began to fly together almost daily racing syrax against kraxis to dragonstone and back here is where our sources diverge grand maester runcider says only that the brothers quarreled again and prince damon departed king's landing to return to the stepstones and his wars of the cause of the quarrel he does not speak others assert that it was at queen allison's urging that viserys sent damon away but septon eustis and mushroom tell another tale or rather two such tales each different from the other eustis the less salacious of the two writes that prince damon seduced his niece the princess and claimed her maidenhood when the lovers were discovered a bed together by sir eric cargill of the kingsguard and brought before the king rhaenyra insisted she was in love with her uncle and pleaded with her father for leave to marry him king viserys would not hear of it however and reminded his daughter that prince damon already had a wife in his wrath he confined his daughter to her chambers told his brother to depart and commanded both of them never to speak of what had happened the tale as told by mushroom is far more depraved as is off the case with his testimony according to the dwarf it was sir christian cole that the princess yearned for not prince damon but sir christian was a true knight noble and chaste and mindful of his vows and though he was in her company day and night he had never so much as kissed her nor made any declaration of his love when he looks at you he sees the little girl you were not the woman you've become damian told his niece but i can teach you how to make him see you as a woman he began by giving her kissing lessons if mushroom can be believed from there the prince went on to show his niece how to best touch a man to bring him to pleasure an exercise that sometimes involved mushroom himself and his alleged enormous member damon taught the girl to disrobe enticingly suckled at her teats to make them larger and more sensitive and flew with her on dragon back to lonely rocks in blackwater bay where they could disport naked all day unobserved and the princess could practice the art of pleasuring a man with her mouth at night he would smuggle her from her rooms dressed as a page boy and take her secretly to brothels on the street of silk where the princess could observe men and women in the act of love and learn more of these womanly arts from the harlots of king's landing just how long these lessons continued mushroom does not say but unlike septon eustis he insists that the princess rhaenyra remained a maiden for she wished to preserve her innocence as a gift for her beloved but when at last she approached her white knight using all she had learned so christian was horrified and spurned her the whole tale soon came out in no small part thanks to mushroom himself king viserys at first refused to believe a word of it until prince damon confirmed the tale was true give the girl to me to wife he purportedly told his brother who else would take a now instead king viserys sent him into exile never to return to the seven kingdoms on pain of death lord strong the king's hand argued that the prince should be put to death immediately as a traitor but septon eustis reminded his grace that no man is as accursed as the kinslayer of the aftermath these things are certain damon targaryen returned to the stepstones and resumed his struggle for those barren storm-swept rocks grand maester runciter and sir harold westerling both died in 112 ac so christian cole was named the lord commander of the kingsguard in sir harold's place and the archmaesters of the citadel sent maester melos to the red keep to take up the grand maester's chain and duties elsewise king's landing returned to its customary tranquility for the best part of two years until 113 ac when princess rhaenyra turned 16 took possession of dragonstone as her own seat and married long before any man had reason to doubt her innocence the question of selecting a suitable consort for rhaenyra had been of concern to king viserys and his council great lords and dashing knights fluttered around her like moths around a flame vying for her favor when rhaenyra visited the trident in 112 the sons of lord bracken and lord blackwood fought a duel over her and a younger son of house frey made so bold as to ask openly for her hand full fray he was called there after in the west sir jason lannister and his twin sir thailand vied for her during a feast and casterly rock the sons of lord tully of riverrun lord tyrell of highgarden and lord oakheart of old oak and lord tarly of horn hill paid court to the princess as did the hand's eldest son sir harwin strong break bones as he was called was heir to harrenhal and said to be the strongest man in the seven kingdoms viserys even talked of wedding rhaenyra to the prince of dorne as a way of bringing the dornish into the realm queen allison had her own candidate her eldest son prince hagin renera's half-brother but aegon was a boy and the princess 10 years as elder moreover the two half-siblings had never got on well all the more reason to bind them together in marriage the queen argued viserys did not agree the boy is alison's own blood he told lord strong she wants him on the throne the best choice king and small council finally agreed would be rhaenyra's cousin lanor velaryon though the great council of 101 had ruled against his claim the valerian boy remained a grandson of prince aemon targaryen of hallowed memory a great grandson of the old king himself such a match would unite and strengthen the royal bloodline and regain the iron throne the friendship of the sea snake with his powerful fleet one objection was raised laenor velaryon was now 19 years of age yet had never shown any interest in women instead he surrounded himself with handsome squires of his own age and was said to prefer their company but grandmaster melos dismissed this concern out of hand what of it he said i do not like the taste of fish but when fish is served i eat it thus the match was decided king and council had neglected to consult the princess however and rhaenyra proved to be very much her father's daughter with her own notions about whom she wished to wed the princess knew much and more about lenore velaryon and had no wish to be his bride my half-brothers would be more to his taste she told the king the princess always took care to refer to queen allison's sons as half-brothers never as brothers and though his grace reasoned with her pleaded with her shouted at her and called her an ungrateful daughter no words of his could budge her until the king brought up the question of succession what a king had done a king could undo viserys pointed out she would wed as he commanded or he would make her half-brother aegen his heir in place of her at this the princess's will gave away septon eustis says she fell at her father's knees and begged for his forgiveness mushroom that she spat in her father's face but both agree in the end that she consented to be married and here again our sources differ that night septon eustis reports sir christian cole slipped into the princess's bedchamber to confess his love for her he told rainier that he had a ship waiting on the bay and begged her to flee with him across the narrow sea they would be wed in tyrosh or old volantis where her father's writ did not run and no one would care that's a christian had betrayed his vows as a member of the kingsguard his prowess with the sword and morningstar was such that he did not doubt he could find some merchant prince to take him into service but rhaenyra refused him she was blood of the dragon she reminded him and meant for more than to live out her life as the wife of a common sell sword and if he could set aside his kingsguard vows why would marriage vows mean any more to him mushroom tells a very different tale in his version it was princess rhaenyra who went as a christian not him to her she found him alone in white sword tower barred the door and slipped off her cloak to reveal her nakedness underneath i saved my maidenhead for you she told him take it now as proof of my love it will mean little and less to my betrothed and perhaps when he learns that i am not chaste he will refuse me yet for all her beauty her entries fell on deaf ears for sir christian cole was a man of honor and true to his vows even when rhaenyra used the arts she had learned from her uncle damon cole would not be swayed scorned and furious the princess dawned her cloak again and swept out into the night where she chanced to encounter sir harwin strong returning from a night of revelry in the stews of the city break bones had long desired the princess and lacks are christian scruples it was he who took rhaenyra's innocence shedding her maiden's blood upon the sword of his manhood according to mushroom who claims to have found them in bed at break of day however it happened whether the princess scorned the night or he her but from that day forward the love that sir christian cole had formally born for rhaenyra targaryen turned to loathing and disdain and the man who had hitherto been the princess's constant companion and champion became the most bitter of her foes not long thereafter rhaenyra set sail for driftmark on the sea snake accompanied by her handmaids two of them the daughters of the hand and sisters to sir harwin the full mushroom and her new champion none other than brick bones himself in 114 ac rhaenyra targaryen princess of dragonstone took to husband sir lenore velaryon knighted a fortnight before the wedding since it was deemed necessary the prince consort be a knight the bride was 17 years old the groom 20 and all agreed that they made a handsome couple the wedding was celebrated with seven days of feasts and jousting the greatest journey in many a year amongst the competitors were queen allison's siblings five sworn brothers of the kingsguard brickbones and the groom's favorite sir joffrey lawnmouth known as the knight of kisses when rhaenyra bestowed her garter on sir harwin her new husband laughed and gave one of his own to sir joffrey denied rhaenyra's favor christian cole turned on queen alicent instead wearing your token the young lord commander of the kingsguard defeated all challengers fighting in a black fury he left break bones with a broken collarbone and a shattered elbow prompting mushroom to name him broken bones thereafter but it was the knight of kisses who felt the fullest measure of his wrath cole's favorite weapon was the morning star and the blows he ringed down on sir laynor's champion cracked his helm and left him senseless in the mud born bloody from the field sir joffrey died without recovering consciousness six days later mushroom tells us that sir lanor spent every hour of those days at his bedside and wept bitterly when the stranger claimed him king viserys was most roth as well a joyous celebration had become the occasion of grief and recrimination it was said that queen allison did not share his displeasure however soon after she asked that sir christian cole be made her personal protector the coolness between the king's wife and the king's daughter was plain for all to see even envoys from the free cities made note of it in letters sent back to pentos braavos and old volantis sir laynor returned to driftmark thereafter leaving many to wonder if his marriage had ever been consummated the princess remained at court surrounded by her friends and admirers so christian cole was not amongst them having gone over entirely to the queen's party the greens but the massive and redoubtable break bones or broken bones as mushroom had it filled his place becoming the foremost of the blacks ever at rhaenyra's side at feast and ball and hunt her husband raised no objections sir layner preferred the comforts of high tide where he soon found a new favorite in a household night named sir carl corrie thereafter though he joined his wife for important court events where his presence was expected sir laner spent most of his days apart from the princess septon eustis says they shared a bed no more than a dozen times mushroom concurs but adds that carl corey oft shared that bet as well it allows the princess to watch the men disboarding with one another he tells us and from time to time the two would include her in their pleasures yet mushroom contradicts himself for elsewhere in his testimony he claims that the princess will leave her husband with his lover on such nights and seek her own solace in the arms of harwin strong whatever the truth was of these tales it was soon announced that the princess was with child born in the waning days of 114 ac the boy was a large strapping lad with brown hair brown eyes and a pug nose sir lenore had the aqualine nose silver white hair and purple eyes that bespoke his valyrian blood lenore's wish to name the child joffrey was overruled by his father lord corliss instead the child was given a traditional valerian name jacaris friends and brothers would call him jace the court was still rejoicing over the birth of the princess's child when her stepmother queen allison also went into labor delivering viserys his third son darren whose coloring unlike that of jace testified to his dragonblood by royal command the infants jacaris velaryon and darren targaryen shared a wet nurse until weaned it was said that the king hoped to prevent any enmity between the two boys by raising them as milk brothers if so his hopes proved to be sadly forlorn a year later in 115 ac there came a tragic mishap of the sort that shapes the destiny of kingdoms the bronze of runestone lady rhea royce fell from her horse whilst hawking and cracked her skull upon a stone she lingered for nine days before finally feeling well enough to leave her bed only to collapse and die within an hour of rising a raven was duly sent to storm's end and lord baratheon dispatched a messenger by ship to bloodstone where prince damon was still struggling to defend his meager kingdom against the men of the triarchy and their dornish allies damon flew it once for the veil to put my wife to rest he said though more like it was in the hopes of laying claim to her lands castles and incomes in that he failed runestone passed instead to lady ria's nephew and when damon made appeal to the eerie not only was his claim dismissed but lady jane warned him that his presence in the vale was unwelcome flying back to the stepstones afterward prince damon landed at driftmark to make a courtesy call upon his erstwhile partnering conquest the sea snake and his wife the princess rhaenys high tide was one of the few places in the seven kingdoms where the king's brother could be confident he would not be turned away there his eye fell upon lord corliss's daughter laina a maid of two and twenty tall slender and surpassingly lovely even mushroom was taken with her beauty writing that she was almost as pretty as her brother with a great mane of silver gold ringlets that fell down past her waist lana had been betrothed from the age of 12 to a son of the sea lord of braavos but the father had died before they could wed and the son soon proved to be a wastrel and a fool squandering his family's wealth and power before turning up on driftmark lacking a graceful means to rid himself of the embarrassment but unwilling to proceed with the marriage lord corliss had repeatedly postponed the wedding prince damon fell in love with lena the singers would have us believe men of a more cynical bent believe the prince saw her as a way to check his own descent once seen as his brother's heir he had fallen far down the line in succession and neither the greens nor the blacks had a place for him but house valerion was powerful enough to defy both parties with impunity weary of the stepstones and free at last of his bronze damon targaryen asked lord corliss for his daughter's hand in marriage the exiled bravosi betrothed remained an impediment but not for long damon mocked him to his face so savagely the boy had no choice but to call him to defend his words with steel armed with dark sister the prince made short work of his rival and wed lady laina velaryon a fortnight later abandoning his hard-scrabble kingdom on the stepstones five other men followed him as kings of the narrow sea until the brief and bloody history of that savage sell sword kingdom ended for good and all prince damon knew that his brother would not be pleased when he heard of his marriage prudently the prince and his new bride took themselves far from westeros soon after the wedding crossing the narrow sea on their dragons some said they flew to valyria in defiance of the curse that hung over the smoking wasteland to search out the secrets of the dragonlords of the old freehold mushroom himself reports this fact in his testimony but we have abundant evidence that the truth was less romantic prince damon and lady elena flew first to pentos where they were feded by the city's prince the pentoshi feared the growing power of the triarchy to the south and saw damon as a valuable ally against the three daughters from there they crossed the disputed lands to old volantis where they enjoyed a similar warm welcome then they flew up the royne to visit cohor and norvos in those cities far removed from the woes of westeros and the power of the triarchy their welcome was less rapturous everywhere they went however huge crowds turned out for a glimpse of veigar and karaxis the dragon riders were once again in pentos when lady laina learned she was with child asking further flight prince damon and his wife settled in a mance outside the city walls as a guest of a pentoshi magister until such time as the babe was born meanwhile back in westeros princess rhaenyra had given birth to a second son late in the year 115 ac the child was named lukaris luke for short septon eustis tells us that both sir lenore and sir harwin were at rainier's bedside for his birth like his brother jace luke had brown eyes and a healthy head of brown hair rather than the silver guilt hair of targaryen princelings but he was a large and lusty lad king viserys was delighted with him when the child was presented at court these feelings were not shared by his queen do keep trying queen allison told sir lanor according to mushroom soon or late you may get one who looks like you and the rivalry between the greens and blacks grew deeper finally reaching the point where the queen and the princess could scarce suffer each other's presence thereafter queen allison kept to the red keep whilst the princess spent her days on dragonstone attended by her ladies mushroom and her champion sir harwin strong her husband sir lenore was said to visit frequently in 116 ac in the free city of pentos lady laina gave birth to twin daughters prince damon's first true born child prince damon named the girls bayla after his father and reina after his mother the babes were small and sickly alas but both had fine features silver white hair and purple eyes when they were half a year old and stronger the girls and their mother sailed to driftmark whilst damon flew ahead with both dragons from high tide he sent a raven to his brother in king's landing informing his grace of the birth of his nieces and begging leave to present the girls at court to receive his royal blessing though his hand and small council argued heatedly against it viserys consented for the king still loved the brother who had been the companion of his youth damon is a father now he told grand maester melos he will have changed thus were the sons of balon targaryen reconciled for the second time in 117 ac on dragonstone princess rhaenyra for yet another son sir lenore was at last permitted to name a child after his fallen friend sir joffrey lonmouth joffrey velaryon was as big and red-faced and healthy as his brothers but like them he had brown eyes brown hair and features that summit court called common the whispering began again amongst the greens it was an article of faith that the father vineera's sons were not her husband lenore but her champion harwin strong mushroom says as much in his testimony and grand mr mellows hints at it while septon eustis raises the rumors only to dismiss them whatever the truth is of these allegations there was never any doubt that king viserys still meant for his daughter to follow him upon the iron throne and her sons to follow her in turn by royal decree each of the valerian boys was presented with a dragon's egg whilst in the cradle those who doubted the paternity of rhaenyra's sons whispered that the eggs would never hatch but the birth in turn of three young dragons gave the lie to the words the hatchlings were named vermax arax and tyraxes and septon eustace tells us that his grace sat jace upon his knee atop the iron throne as he was holding court and was heard to say one day this will be your seat lad childbirth exacted a toll on the princess the weight that rhaenyra gained during her pregnancies never entirely left her and by the time her youngest boy was born she had grown stout and thick of waist the beauty of her girlhood a fading memory though she was but 20 years of age according to mushroom this only served to deepen her resentment of her stepmother queen allison who remains slender and graceful at half again her age the sins of the fathers are oft visited on the sons wise men have said and so it is for the sons of mothers as well the enemy between queen alicent and princess rhaenyra was passed on to their sons and the queen's three boys the princes aegon ayment and darren grew to be bitter rivals of their valerian nephews resentful of them for having stolen what they regarded as their birthright the iron throne itself though all six boys attended the same feasts balls and revels and sometimes trained together in the yard under the same master at arms and studied under the same maesters this enforced closeness only served to feed their mutual mislike rather than binding them together as brothers whilst princess rhaenyra misliked her stepmother queen allison she became fond and more than fond of her good sister lady laina with driftmark and dragonstone so close damon and elena oft visited with the princes and her with them many a time they flew together on their dragons and the princesses she dragon xerax produced several clutches of eggs in 118 ac with the blessing of king viserys rhaenyra announced the betrothal of her two eldest sons to the daughters of prince damon and lady lena jacarys was four and lucaris three the girls two and in 119 ac when lena found she was with child again rainer flew to driftmark to attend her during the birth and so it was that the princess was at her good sister's side on the third day of that accursed year in 120 ac the year of the red spring a day in a night of labor left laina velaryon pale and weak but finally she gave birth to the son prince damon had so long desired but the babe was twisted and malformed and died within the hour nor did his mother long survive him her grueling labor had drained all of lady elena's strength and grief weakened her still further making her helpless before the onset of childbed fever as her condition steadily worsened despite the best efforts of driftmark's young maester prince damon flew to dragonstone and brought back princess rhaenyra's own maester an older and more experienced man renowned for his skills as a healer sadly maester gerardis came too late after three days of delirium lady lena passed from this mortal coil she was but 27. during her final hour it is said ladylina rose from her bed pushed away the septus pring over her and made her way from the room intent on reaching vegar that she might fly one last time before she died her strength failed her on the tower's steps however and it was there she collapsed and died her husband prince damon carried her back to her bed afterward mushroom tells us princess rhaenyra sat vigil with him over lady elena's corpse and comforted him in his grief lady lena's death was the first tragedy of 120 ac but it would not be the last for this was to be a year when many of the long simmering tensions and jealousies that had plagued the seven kingdoms finally came to a boil a year when many and more would have reason to wail and grieve and rend their garments though none more than the sea snake lord cordless valerian and his noble wife princess rhaenys she who might have been a queen the lord of the tides and his lady were still in mourning for their beloved daughter when the stranger came again to carry off their son sir laynor velaryon husband to the princess rhaenyra and the putative father of her children was slain whilst attending a fair and spice town stabbed to death by his friend and companion sir carl corey the two men had been quarreling loudly before blades were drawn merchants at the fair told lord valerian when he came to collect his son's body corey had fled by then wounding several men who tried to hinder him some claimed a ship had been waiting for him off shore he was never seen again the circumstances of the murder remain a mystery to this day grand maester melis writes only that sir lenore was killed by one of his own household knights after a quarrel septon eustis provides us with the killer's name and declares jealousy the motive for the slaying lenore velaryon had grown weary of sir carl's companionship and had grown enamored of a new favorite a handsome young squire of six and ten mushroom as always favors the most sinister theory suggesting that prince damon paid carl corey to dispose of princess raniere's husband arranged for a ship to carry him away and then cut his throat and fed him to the sea a household night of relatively low birth corey was known to have a lord's tastes and a peasant's purse and was given to extravagant wagering besides which lends a certain credence to the fool's versions of events yet there was no shard of proof then or now though the sea snake offered a reward of ten thousand golden dragons for any man who could lead him to sir carl corrie or deliver the killer to a father's vengeance even this was not the end of the tragedies that would mark this dreadful year the next occurred at high tide after selenor's funeral when king in court made the journey to driftmark to bear witness at his pyre many on the backs of the dragons so many dragons were present that septon eustis wrote that driftmark had become the new valyria the cruelty of children is known to all prince aegin was 13 princess helena 11 prince eamonn 10 and prince darren six both aegin and helena were dragon riders helena now flew dream fire the she-dragon who had once carried reyna maker the cruel's black bride whilst her brother aegin's young sunfire was said to be the most beautiful dragon ever seen upon the earth even prince darren had a dragon a lovely blue she dragon named tesarion though he had yet to ride only the middle son prince aemond remained dragonless but his grace had hopes of rectifying that and put forward the notion that perhaps the court might suggern at dragonstone after the funeral a wealth of dragon's eggs could be found beneath the dragon mont and several young hatchlings as well prince aemon could have his choice if the lad is bold enough even at 10 eamon targaryen did not lag for boldness the king's guide stung and he resolved not to wait for dragonstone what did he want with some puny hatchling or some stupid egg right there at high tide was a dragon worthy of him vegar the oldest largest and most terrible dragon in the world even for a son of house targaryen there are always dangers in approaching a dragon particularly an old bad tempered dragon who has recently lost her rider his father and mother would never allow him to go near veigar eamon knew much less try to ride her so he made certain they did not know sliding from his bed at dawn whilst they still slept and stealing down to the outer yard where vegar and the other dragons were fed and stabled the prince had hoped to mount vegar in secrecy but as he crept up to the dragon a boy's voice rung out you stay away from her the voice belonged to the youngest of his half-nephews joffrey valerion a boy of three always an early riser joff had sneaked down from his bed to see his own young dragon tyraxes afraid that the boy would raise the alarm prince eamon shouted at him to be quiet then he shoved him backward into a pile of dragon droppings as joff began a ball eamonn raced to vegar and clambered up her back later he would say that he was so afraid of being caught that he forgot to be frightened of being burned to death and eaten call it boldness call it madness called fortune or the will of the gods or the caprice of dragons who can know the mind of such a beast we do know this veigar roared lurched to her feet shook violently and then snapped her chains and flew and the boy prince aemon targaryen became a dragon rider circling twice around the towers of high tide before coming down again but when he landed rhaenyra's sons were waiting for him joffrey had run to get his brothers when eamonn took to the sky and both jace and luke had come to his call the valerian princelings were younger than aymond jace was six luke five joff only three but there were three of them and they had armed themselves with wooden swords from the training yard now they fell on him with a fury eamonn fought back breaking luke's nose with a punch then wrenching the sword from joffrey's hands and cracking it across the back of jace's head driving him to his knees as the younger boys scrambled back away from him bloody and bruised the prince began to mock them laughing and calling them the strongs jace at least was old enough to grasp the insult he flew at aymond once again but the older boy began pummeling him savagely until luke coming to the rescue of his brother drew his dagger and slashed eamonn across the face taking out his right eye by the time the stable boys finally arrived to pull apart the combatants the prince was writhing on the ground howling in pain and veigar was roaring as well afterward king viserys tried to make a piece requiring each of the boys to tender an apology to his rivals on the other side but these courtesies did not appease their vengeful mothers queen allison demanded that one of lucerus valerion's eyes should be put out for the eye he had cost eamonn's princess rhaenyra would have none of that but insisted that prince aemon should be questioned sharply until he revealed where he had heard her sons called strong's to so name them was tantamount to saying they were bastards with no rights to succession and that she herself was guilty of high treason when pressed by the king prince eamonn said it was his brother aegon who had told him they were strongs and prince aegon said only everyone knows just look at them king viserys finally put an end to the questioning declaring he would hear no more no eyes would be put out he decreed but should anyone man woman or child noble or common or royal mock his grandsons as strong's again their tongues will be pulled out with hot pincers his grace further commanded his wife and daughter to kiss and exchange vows of love and affection but their false smiles and empty words deceived no one but the king as for the boys prince aemon said later that he lost an eye and gained a dragon that day and counted it as a fair exchange to prevent further conflict and put an end to these vile rumors and base calumnies king viserys further decreed that queen alcent and her sons would return with him to court whilst princess rhaenyra can find herself to dragonstone with her sons henceforth sir eric cargill of the kingsguard would serve as their sworn shield whilst breakbones return to hiran harrenhal these rulings please no one septon eustis writes mushroom dimers one man at least was thrilled by the decrees for dragonstone and driftmark lay quite close to one another and this proximity would allow daemon targaryen ample opportunity to comfort his niece princess rhaenyra unbeknownst to the king though viserys the first would reign for nine more years the bloody seeds of the dance of the dragons had already been planted and 120 ac was the year when they began to sprout the next to parish were the elder strongs lionel strong lord of harrenhal and hand of the king accompanied by his son and heir sir harwin on his return to the great half ruined castle on the lakeshore shortly after their arrival a fire broke out in the tower where they were sleeping and both father and son were killed along with three of their retainers and a dozen servants the cause of the fire was never determined some put it down as simple miss chance whilst others muttered that black heron's seat was cursed and brought only doom to any man who held it many suspected the blaze was set intentionally mushrooms suggest that the sea snake was behind it as an act of vengeance against the man who had cuckolded his son septon eustis more plausibly suspects prince damon removing a rival for princess rainier's affections others have put forth the notion that larry's clubfoot might have been responsible with his father and elder brother dead larry strong became the lord of harrenhal the most disturbing possibility was advanced by none other than grand maester melos who muses that the king himself might have given the command if viserys had come to accept that the rumors about the parentage of rhaenyra's children were true he might as well have wished to remove the man who had dishonored his daughter lest he somehow reveal the bastardy of her sons word that so lionel strong's death was an unfortunate accident for his lordship's decision to see his son back to harrenhal had been unforeseen lord strong had been the king's hand and viserys had come to rely upon his strength and counsel his grace had reached the age of 3 and 40 and had grown quite stout he no longer had the young man's vigor and was afflicted by gouts aching joints back pain and tightness in the chest that came and went off left him red-faced and short of breath the governance of the realm was a daunting task the king needed a strong capable hand to shoulder some of his burdens briefly he considered sending for princess rhaenyra who better to rule with him than the daughter he meant to succeed him on the iron throne but that would have meant bringing the princess and her sons back to king's landing where more conflict with the queen and her own brood would have been inevitable he considered his brother as well until he recalled prince damon's previous stints on the small council grand maester mello suggested bring in some younger man and put forward several names but his grace chose familiarity and recalled to court sir otto hightower the queen's father who had filled the office before for both viserys and the old king yet hardly had sir otto arrived at the red keep to take up the handship then word reached court that princess rhaenyra had remarried taking to husband her uncle damon targaryen the princess was 23 prince damon 39 king court and commons were all outraged by the news neither damon's wife nor rhaenyra's husband had been dead even half a year to what again so soon was an insult to their memories his grace declared angrily the marriage had been performed on dragonstone suddenly and secretly septon used his claims that rhaenyra knew her father would never approve of the match so she wed in haste to make certain he could not prevent the marriage mushroom puts forward a different reason the princess was once again with child and did not wish to birth a bastard and thus that dreadful year 120 ac ended as it begun with a woman laboring in childbirth princess rhaenyra's pregnancy had a happier outcome than lady lena's had as the year waned she brought forth a small but robust sun a pale princeling with dark purple eyes and pale silvery hair she named him again prince damon had at last a living son of his own blood and this new prince unlike his three half brothers was plainly a targaryen in king's landing however queen allison grew most roth when she learned that babe had been named aegen taking that first sleight against her own son again which according to the testimony of mushroom it most certainly was important footnote by george rr martin hereafter to avoid confusing the two princes we will refer to queen allison's son as aegen the elder and princess rhaenyra's son as agent the younger by all rights the year 122 ac should have been a joyous one for house targaryen princess rhaenyra took to the birthing bed once more and gave her uncle damon a second son named viserys after his grandsire the child was smaller and less robust than his brother aegin and his valerian half-brothers but proved to be a most precocious child though somewhat ominously the dragon's egg placed in his cradle never hatched the greens took that for a nil omen and were not shy about saying as much later that same year king's landing celebrated a wedding as well following the ancient tradition of house targaryen king viserys wed his son egan the elder to his daughter helena the groom was 15 years of age a lazy and somewhat silky boy septoneusis tells us but possessed of more than healthy appetites a glutton at the table given to swilling ale and strong wine and pinching and fondling any serving girl who strayed within his reach the bride his sister was but 13. though plumper and less striking than most targaryens helena was a pleasant happy girl and all agreed she would make a fine mother and so she did and quickly barely a year later in 123 ac the 14 year old princess gave birth to two twins a boy she named jiharis and a girl she named jahera prince aegon had heirs of his own now the greens at court proclaimed happily a dragon's egg was placed in the cradle of each child and two hatchlings soon came forth yet all was not well with these new twins jahira was tiny and slow to grow she did not cry and she did not smile and she did none of the things a babe was meant to do her brother whilst larger and more robust was also less than perfect than expected of a targaryen princeling boasting six fingers on his left hand and six toes upon each foot a wife and children did little to curb the carnal appetites of prince egg and the elder if mushroom is to be believed he fathered two bastard children the same year as the twins a boy on a girl whose maidenhood he won at auction on the street of silk and a girl by one of his mother's maidservants and in 127 ac princess helena gave birth to a second son who was given a dragon's egg and the name maelor quinalson's other sons had been growing older as well prince eamonn despite the loss of his eye had become a proficient and dangerous swordsman under the tutelage of sir christian cole but remained a wild and willful child hot-tempered and unforgiving his little brother prince darren was most popular of the queen's sons as clever as he was courteous and most comely as well when he turned 12 and 1-26 ac darren was sent to old town to observe as cupbearer and squire to lord hightower that same year across blackwater bay the sea snake was stricken by a sudden fever as he took to his bed surrounded by maesters the issue arose as to who would succeed him as lord of the tides and master of driftmarks should the sickness claim him with both his true born children dead by law his lands and titles should pass to the eldest grandson jacaris but since jace was presumably to ascend the iron throne after his mother princess rhaenyra urged her good father to name instead her second son lucaris lord corliss also had half a dozen nephews however and the eldest of them surveymen velaryon protested that the inheritance by right should pass to him on the grounds that rhaenyra's sons were bastards sired by harwin strong the princess was not slow in answering this charge she dispatched prince damon to see surveillance had his head removed and fed his carcass toward dragon cerax even this did not end the matter however sir vaymen's younger cousins fled to king's landing with his wife and sons there to cry for justice and place their claims before the king and queen king viserys had grown extremely fat and read a face and scarce had the strength to mount the steps to the iron throne his grace heard them out in a stony silence then ordered their tongues removed every one you were warned he declared as they were being dragged away i will hear no more of these lies yet as he was descending his grace stumbled and reached out to right himself and sliced his left hand open to the bone on a jagged blade protruding from the throne the grand maester melos washed the cut out with boiled wine and bound up the hands with strips of linen soaked in healing ointments fever soon followed and many feared the king might die only the arrival of princess rhaenyra from dragonstone turned the tide for with her came her own healer maester gerardus who acted swiftly to remove two fingers from his grace's hand to save his life though much weakened by his ordeal king viserys soon resumed the rule to celebrate his recovery a feast was held on the first day of 127 ac the princess and the queen were both commanded to attend with all their children in a show of enmity each woman wore the other's color and many declarations of love were made to the king's great pleasure prince damon raised a cup to sir otto hightower and thanked him for his legal service as hand sir otto in turn spoke of the prince's courage whilst allison's children and rhaenyras greeted one another with kisses and broke bread together at table or so the court chronicles record yet late in the evening after king viserys had departed for his grace still tired easily mushroom tells us that eamonn's one eye rose to toast his valyrian nephews speaking in mock admiration of their brown's hair brown eyes and strength i've never known anyone so strong as my sweet nephews he ended so let us drain our cuffs to the three strong boys still later the full reports again the elder took offense when jakaris asked his wife helena for a dance angry words were exchanged and the two princes might have come to blows if not for the intervention of the kingsguard whether king viserys was ever informed of these incidents we do not know but princess rhaenyra and her sons returned to their own seat on dragonstone the next morning after the loss of his fingers viserys the first never sat upon the iron throne again thereafter he shunned the throne room preferring to hold court in his solar and later in his bed chamber surrounded by maesters septons and his faithful full mushroom the only man who could still make him laugh says mushroom death visited the court again a short time later when grand mr mellows collapsed one night while he was climbing the serpentine steps his had always been a moderating voice in the council forever urging calm and compromise whenever issues arose between the blacks and the greens to the king's distress however the passing of the man he called my trusted friend only served to provoke a fresh dispute between the factions princess rhaenyra wanted maester garridus who had long served her on dragonstone elevated to replace melos it was only his healing skills that had saved the king's life when viserys cut his hand on the throne she claimed queen allison however insisted that the princess and her maester had mutilated his grace unnecessarily had they not meddled she claimed grand maester melis would surely have saved the king's fingers as well of his life she urged the appointment of one maester alphador presently in service at the hightower viserys beset from both sides chose neither reminding both the princess and the queen that the choice was not his to make the citadel of old town chose the grand maester not the crown in due time the conclave bestowed the chain of office upon archmaester orwell one of their own king viserys did seem to recover some of his old vigor once he knew the grand maester had arrived at court septon eustis tells us that this was the result of prayer but most believe that orwell's potions and tinctures were more efficacious than the leechings mellows had preferred but such recoveries proved short-lived and gout chest pains and shortness of breath continued to trouble the king in the final years of his reign as his health failed viserys left ever more of the governance of the realm to his hand and small council per force we ought to look at the members of that small council on the eve of the great events of 129 ac for they were to play a large role in all that followed the king's hand remains sir otto hightower father of the queen and uncle to the lord of old town grand maester orwell was the newest member of the council and was thought to favor neither blacks nor greens the lord commander of the kingsguard remains to christian call however and in him rhaenyra had a bitter foe the aged lord lyman beesberry was master of coin in which capacity he had served almost uninterrupted since the old king's day the youngest conciliars were the lord admiral and master of ships sir tylen lannister brother to the lord of casterly rock and the lord confessor and master of whisperers larry strong lord of harrenhal lord jasper wilde master of laws known amongst the small folk as iron rod completed the council lord wilde's unbending attitudes on matters of law earned him this subraquette septon eustace says but mushroom declares that ironrod was named for the stiffness of his member having sired 29 children on four wives before the last died of exhaustion as the seven kingdoms welcomed the 129th year after aegon's conquest with bonfires feasts and bacchanals king viserys the first targaryen was growing ever weaker his chest pains had grown so severe that he could no longer climb a flight of steps and had to be carried about the red keep in a chair by the second moon of the year his grace had lost all appetite and was ruling the realm from his bed when he felt strong enough to rule it all most days he preferred to leave matters of state to his hand sir otto hightower on dragonstone meanwhile princess rhaenyra was once again with child she too took to her bed on the third day of the third moon of 129 ac princess helena brought her three children to visit with the king in his chambers the twins jaharis and jahara were six years old their brother maelor only two his grace gave the babe a pearl ring off his finger to play with and told the twins the story of how their great great grandsire and namesake jiharis had flown his dragons north to the wall to defeat a vast horde of wildlings giants and wargs though the children had heard the story a dozen times before they listened attentively afterward the king sent them away pleading weariness and a tightness in his chest then viserys of house targaryen the first of his name king of the andals the ruiner and the first men lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the realm closed his eyes and went to sleep he never woke he was 52 years old and had reigned over most of westeros for 26 years then the storm broke and the dragons danced fire and blood chapter 12 george r r martin you
