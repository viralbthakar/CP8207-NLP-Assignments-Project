 fire and blood the sons of the dragon king aegon the first targaryen took both of his sisters to wife rhaenys and vicenja were dragon riders with the silver gold hair purple eyes and beauty of true targaryens elsewise the two queens were as unlike each other as any two women could be save in one other respect each of them gave the king a son aenes came first born in 7ac to aegon's younger wife rhaenys the boy was small at birth and sickly he cried all the time and it was said that his limbs were spindly his eyes small and watery and that the king's masers feared for his survival he would spit out the nipples of his wet nurse and give suck only at his mother's breasts and rumors claimed that he screamed for a fortnight when he was weaned so unlike king aegon was he that a few even dared to suggest that his grace was not the boy's true sire that annie's was some bastard born of one of queen rainey's many handsome favorites the son of a singer or a mummer or a mime and the prince was slow to grow as well not until he was given the young dragon quicksilver a hatchling born that same year on dragonstone did any targaryen begin to thrive prince aenes was three when his mother queen rhaenys and her dragon meraxies were slain in dorne her death left the boy prince inconsolable he stopped eating and even began to crawl as he had when he was one as if he had forgotten how to walk his father despaired of him and rumors flew about the court that king aegon might take another wife as rhaenys was dead and visenya childless and perhaps barren the king kept his own counsel on these matters so no man could say what thoughts he might have entertained but many great lords and noble knights appeared at court with their maiden daughters each more calmly than the last all such speculation ended in 11ac when queen visenya suddenly announced that she was carrying the king's child a son she proclaimed confidently and so he proved to be the prince came squalling into the world in 12ac no newborn was ever more robust than megar targaryen maestro's him and wives agreed his weight at birth was almost twice that of his elder brother the half-brothers were never close prince aenes was the heir apparent and king aegon kept him close by his side as the king moved about the realm from castle to castle so did the prince prince maegor remained with his mother sitting by her side when she held court queen visenya and king aegon were off to part in those years when he was not on a royal progress aegon would return to king's landing and the aegon fort whilst visenya and her son remained on dragonstone for this reason lords and commons alike began to refer to maegar as the prince of dragonstone queen vicenia put a sword into her son's hand when he was three supposedly the first thing he did with the blade was butcher one of the castle cats men said though more like this tale was a calumny devised by his enemies many years later that the prince took swordplay at once cannot be denied however for his first master at arms his mother chose sir and corbrey as deadlied as he could be found in all seven kingdoms prince aenes was so often in his sire's company that his own instruction in the chivalric arts came largely from the knights of aegon's kingsguard and sometimes the king himself the boy was diligent his instructors agreed and did not want for courage but he lacked his sire size and strength and was never more than adequate as a fighter even when the king pressed blackfyre into his hands as he did from time to time aenes would not disgrace himself in battle his tutors told one another but no songs would ever be sung about his prowess such gifts as this prince possessed lay elsewhere aenes was a fine singer himself as it happened with a strong sweet voice he was courteous and charming clever without being bookish he made friends easily and young girls seem to dote on him be they highborn or low amy's loved to ride as well his father gave him coursers palfreys and destreers but his favorite mount was his dragon quicksilver prince maegor wrote as well but showed no great love for horses dogs or any animal when he was eight a palfrey kicked him in the stables maegor stabbed the horse to death and slashed half the face off the stable boy who came running at the beast's screams the prince of dragonstone had many companions through the years but no true friends he was a quarrelsome boy quick to take offense slow to forgive fearsome in his wrath his skill with weapons was unmatched however esquire at eight he was on horsing boys four and five years as elder in the list by the time he was 12 and battering seasoned men at arms into submission in the castle yard on his 13th name day in 25 ac his mother queen visenya bestowed her own valyrian steel blade dark sister upon him half a year before his marriage the tradition among the targaryens had always been to marry kin to kin wedding brother to sister was thought to be ideal failing that a girl might wed an uncle a cousin or a nephew a boy a cousin aunt or niece this practice went back to old valyria where it was common amongst many of the ancient families particularly those who bred and rode dragons the blood of the dragon must remain pure the wisdom went some of the sorcerer princes also took more than one wife when it pleased them though this was less common than incestuous marriage in valyria before the doom wise men wrote a thousand gods were honored but none were feared so few dare to speak against these customs this was not true in westeros where the power of the faith went unquestioned the old gods were still worshiped in the north and the drowned god in the iron islands but in the rest of the realm there was a single god with seven faces and his voice upon the earth was the high septon of old town and the doctrines of the faith handed down through centuries from andalos itself condemned the valyrian marriage customs as practiced by the targaryens incest was denounced as vile sin whether between father and daughter mother and son or brother and sister and the fruits of such unions were considered abominations in the sight of gods and men with hindsight it can be seen that the conflict between the faith and house targaryen was inevitable indeed many amongst the most devout had expected the high septon to speak out against aegon and his sisters during the conquest and were most displeased when the father of the faithful instead counseled lord hightower against opposing the dragon and even blessed and anointed him at his second coronation familiarity is the father of acceptance it is said the high septon who had crowned aegon the conqueror remained the shepherd of the faithful until his death in 11ac with which time the realm had grown accustomed to the notion of a king with two queens who were both wives and sisters king aegon always took care to honor the faith confirming its traditional rights and privileges exempting its wealth and property from taxation and affirming that septons septas and the other servants of the seven accused of wrongdoing could only be tried by the faith's own courts the accord between the faith and the iron throne continued all through the reign of aegon the first from 11ac to 37ac six high septons wore the crystal crown his grace remained on good terms with each of them calling at the starry sept each time he came to old town yet the question of incestuous marriage remained simmering below the courtesies like poison whilst the high septons of king aegon's reign never spoke out against the king's marriages to his sisters neither did they declare to be lawful the humbler members of the faith village septons holy sisters begging brothers poor fellows still believed it's sinful for brother to lie with sister or for a man to take two wives aegon the conqueror had fathered no daughters however so these matters did not come to a head at once the sons of the dragon had no sisters to marry so each of them was forced to seek elsewhere for a bride prince aenes was the first to marry in 22ac he wed the lady alyssa the maiden daughter of the lord of the tides ethan velaryon king aegon's lord admiral and master of ships she was 15 the same age as the prince and shared his silvery hair and purple eyes as well for the velaryons where an ancient family descended from valyrian stock king aegon's own mother had been a valerion so the marriage was reckoned one of cousin to cousin it soon proved both happy and fruitful the following year alyssa gave birth to a daughter prince aenes named her reina in honor of his mother like her father the girl was small at birth but unlike him she proved to be a happy healthy child with lively lilac eyes and hair that shone like beaten silver it was written that king aegon himself wept the first time his granddaughter was placed in his arms and thereafter doted upon the child mayhaps in some part because she reminded him of his lost queen rhaenys in whose memory she had been named as the glad tidings of reina's birth spread across the land the realm rejoiced save perhaps queen visenya prince aenes was the unquestioned heir to the iron throne all agreed but now an issue arose as to whether prince maegor remains second in line of succession or should be considered to have fallen to third behind the newborn princess queen vicenia proposed to settle the matter by betrothing the infant reina to maegor who had just turned eleven aenes and alyssa spoke against the match however and when word reached the starry sept the high septon sent a raven warning the king that such a marriage would not be looked upon with favor by the faith his high holiness proposed a different bride for maegor his own niece cerise hightower maiden daughter to the lord of old town manfred hightower not to be confused with his grandsire of the same name king aegon mindful of the advantages of closer ties with old town and its ruling house saw wisdom in the choice and agreed to the match thus it came to pass that in 25 ac maegor targaryen prince of dragonstone wed lady cyrese hightower in the starry sept of old town with a high septon himself performing the nuptials maegor was 13 the bride 10 years as senior but the lords who bore witness to the betting all agreed that the prince made a lusty husband and maegor himself boasted that he had consummated the marriage a dozen times i made a son for harsh targaryen that night he proclaimed as he broke fast the son came the next year but the boy named aegon after his grandsire was born to lady alyssa and fathered by prince aenes once again celebrations swept the seven kingdoms the little prince was robust and fierce and had a warrior's look about him declared his grandsire aegon the dragon himself while many still debated whether prince maegor or his niece reina should have precedence in order of succession it seemed beyond question that aegon would follow his father aenes just as anes followed aegon in the years that followed other children came one after another to house targaryen to the delight of king aegon if not necessarily that of queen vicenja in 29ac prince aegon acquired a baby brother when alyssa gave prince aenies a second son viceros in 34ac she gave birth to jiharis her fourth child and third son in 36 ac came another daughter alisaine princess reyna was 13 when her little sister was born but grand maester gowan observed that the girl delighted so much in the babe that one might think she was the mother herself the eldest daughter of aenes and alyssa was a shy dreamy child who seemed to be more comfortable with animals than other people as a little girl she often hid behind her mother's skirt or clung to her father's leg in the presence of strangers but she loved to feed the castle cats and always had a puppy or two in the bed though her mother provided her with a succession of suitable companions the daughters of lords of great and small reina never seemed to warm to any of them preferring the company of a book at the age of nine however reyna was presented with a hatchling from the pits of dragonstone and she and the young dragon named dreamfire bonded instantly with her dragon beside her the princess slowly began to grow out of her shyness at the age of 12 she took to the skies for the first time and thereafter though she remained a quiet girl no one dared to call her timid not long after rayna made her first true friend in the person of her cousin larissa velaryon for a time the two girls were inseparable until larissa was suddenly recalled to driftmark to be wed to the second son of the even star of tarth the young are nothing if not resilient however and the princess soon found a new companion in the hand's daughter samantha stokeworth it was princess rayna legend says who put a dragon's egg in princess elisande's cradle just as she had for prince jiharis two years earlier if those tales be true from those eggs came the dragons silver wing and vermithor whose names would be writ so large in the annals of the years to come princess rayna's love for his siblings and the realms joy at each new targaryen princeling was not shared by prince maegor or his mother queen vicenja for each new son born to aines pushed maegor further down the line of succession and there were still those who claimed he stood behind annie's daughters too and all the while maegor himself remained childless for lady cyrese did not quicken in the years that followed their marriage on tourney ground in battlefield however prince maegor's accomplishments far exceeded those of his brother in the great tourney at river run in 28ac maegor unhorsed three knights of the kingsguard in successive tilts before falling to the eventual champion in the melee no man could stand before him afterward he was knighted on the field by his father who dubbed him with no less a blade than black fire at 10 and 6 maegor became the youngest knight in the seven kingdoms other feats followed in 29ac and again in 30ac maegor accompanied osman strong and ethan velaryon to the stepstones to root out the lysine pirate king sargoso san and fought in several bloody afrais showing himself to be both fearless and deadly in 31ac he hunted down and slew a notorious robber knight in the riverlands the so-called giant of the trident maegor was not yet a dragon rider however though a dozen hatchlings had been born amidst the fires of dragonstone in the later years of aegon's reign and were offered to the prince he'd refused them all when his young niece reina in only her 12th year took to the sky a stride dream fire maegor's failure became the talk of king's landing lady alyssa teased him about it one day in court wondering aloud whether my good brother is afraid of the dragons prince maegor darkened in rage at the jape then replied coolly that there was only one dragon worthy of him the last seven years of the reign of igon the conqueror were peaceful ones after the frustrations of his dornish war the king accepted the continued independence of dorne and flew to sunspear on belirion on the 10th anniversary of the peace accords to celebrate a feast of friendship with daria martell the reigning princess of dorne prince aenes accompanied him on quicksilver maegor remained on dragonstone aegon had made the seven kingdoms one with fire and blood but after celebrating his 16th name day in 33 ac he turned instead to brick and mortar half of every year was still given over to royal progress but now it was prince aenes and his wife lady alissa who journeyed from castle to castle whilst the aging king remained at home dividing his days between dragonstone and king's landing the fishing village where aegon had first landed had grown into a sprawling stinking city of a hundred thousand souls by that time only old town and lannisport were larger yet in many ways king's landing was still little more than an army camp that had swollen to grotesque size dirty wreaking unplanned impermanent and the aegon fort which had spread halfway down aegon's high hill by that time was as ugly a castle as any in the seven kingdoms a great confusion of wood in earth and brick that had long outgrown the old log palisades that were its only walls it was certainly no fit abode for a great king in 35 ac aegon moved with all his court back to dragonstone and gave orders that the egan fort be torn down so that a newcastle might be raised in its place this time he decreed he would build in stone to oversee the design and construction of the new castle he named the king's hand lord alan stokeworth sir osmond strong had died in the previous year and queen visenya a jape went about the court that king aegon had given visenya charge of the building the red keep so he would not endure her presence on dragonstone aegon the conqueror died of a stroke on dragonstone in his 37th year after conquest his grandsons aegon and viserys were with him at his death in the chamber of the painted table the king was showing them the details of his conquests prince maegor in residence at dragonstone at the time spoke the eulogy as his father's body was laid upon a funeral pyre in the castle yard the king was clad in battle armor his mailed hands folded over the hilt of blackfire since the days of old valyria it had ever been the custom of house targaryen to burn their dead rather than consigning their remains to the ground vegar supplied the flames to light the fire blackfyre was burned with the king but retrieved by maegor afterward its blade darker but elsewise unharmed no common fire can damage valyrian steel the dragon was survived by his sister visenya his sons aines and maegor and five grandchildren prince aenes was 30 years of age at his father's death prince maegor 5 and 20. amy's had been at highgarden on his progress when his father died but quicksilver returned him to dragonstone for the funeral afterward he donned his father's iron and ruby crown and grand maester gowen proclaimed him aenes of house targaryen the first of his name king of the andals and the ruiner and the first man lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the realm the lords who had come to dragonstone to bid their king farewell knelt and bowed their heads when prince maegor's turn came aines drew him back to his feet kissed his cheek and said brother you need never kneel to me again we shall rule this realm together you and i then the king presented his father's sword blackfyre to his brother saying you are more fit to bear this blade than me wielded in my service and i shall be content this bequest would prove to be most unwise as later events would demonstrate since queen visenya had previously gifted her son with dark sister prince maegor now possessed both of the ancestral valyrian steel swords of house targaryen from this date forward however he would wield only blackfyre whilst dark sister hung on the walls of his chamber on dragonstone after the funeral rites had been completed the new king and his entourage sailed to king's landing where the iron throne still stood amidst mounds of rubble and mud the old aegon fort had been torn down and pits and tunnels pockmarked the hill where the cellars and foundations of the red keep were being dug but the new castle had not yet begun to rise nonetheless thousands came to cheer king aenes as he claimed his father's seat for his own thereafter his grace set out for old town to receive the blessing of the high septon though he could have made the journey in a few short days on quicksilver aines preferred to travel by land accompanied by 300 mountain knights and their retinues queen elissa rode beside him together with their three eldest children princess reyna was 14 years of age a beautiful young girl who stole the heart of every knight who saw her prince aegon was eleven prince of sarah's eight their younger siblings jiharis and alisaine were deemed too young for such an arduous journey and remained on dragonstone after setting out from king's landing the king's party made its way south to storm's end then west across the dornish marches to old town guesting at each castle along the way his return would be by the way of highgarden lannisport and riverrun it was decreed all along the route the small folk appeared by the hundreds and thousands to hail their new king and queen and cheer the young princes and princess but whilst aegon and viserys relished in the cheers of the crowds and the feast and frolics put on at every castle to entertain the new monarch and his family prince raina reverted to her former shyness at storm's end horus baratheon's maester went so far as to write the princess did not seem to want to be there nor did she approve of anything she saw or heard she scours seemed to eat would not hunt or hawk when she pressed to sing for she is said to have a lovely voice she refused rudely and returned to her chambers the princess had been most loathed to be parted from her dragon dreamfire and her latest favorite melanie piper a red-haired maiden from the riverlands it was only when her mother queen alyssa sent for lady melanie to join them on the progress that rayna finally put aside her sullenness to join the celebrations at the starry sept the high septon anointed aenese targaryen as his predecessor had once anointed his father and presented him with the crown of yellow gold with the faces of the seven in laden jade and pearl yet even as aenes was receiving the blessing of the father of the faithful others were casting doubt on his fitness to sit on the iron throne westeros required a warrior they whispered to one another and maegor was plainly the stronger of the dragon's two sons foremost among the whispers was the dowager queen vicenja targaryen the truth is plain enough she is reported to have said even a knee sees it why else would he have given blackfyre to my son he knows that only maegor has the strength to rule the new king's medal would be tested sooner than anyone could have imagined the wars of conquest had left scars throughout the realm sons now come of age dreamed of avenging long long-dead fathers knights remember the days when a man with a sword and a horse and a sort of armor could slash his way into riches and glory lords recalled a time when they did not need a king's leave to tax their small folk or kill their enemies the chains the dragon forged can yet be broken the discontented told one another we can win our freedoms back and now is the time to strike for this new king is weak the first stirrings of revolt were in the riverlands amidst the colossal ruins of harrenhal aegon had granted the castle to sir quentin cohorus his old master at arms when lord kojoris died in a fall from his horse in 9ac his title passed to his grandson gargan a fat and foolish man with an unseemly appetite for young girls who became known as gargan the guest lord gargan soon became infamous for turning up at every wedding celebrated within his domains so that he might enjoy the lord's right of the first night a more unwelcome wedding guest can scarce be imagined he also made free with the wives and daughters of his own servants king aines was still on his progress guesting with lord tully of river run on his way back to king's landing when the father of a maid whom lord kaharis had honored opened a postern gate at harrenhal to an outlaw who styled himself hair in the red and claimed to be a grandson of heron the black the brigands pulled his lordship from his bed and dragged him to the castle godswood where herons sliced off his genitals and fed them to a dog a few legal men at arms were killed the rest agreed to join heron who declared himself lord of harrenhal and king of the rivers not being ironborn he did not claim the islands when word reached riverrun lord tully urged the king to mount quicksilver and descend on harrenhal as his father had but his grace perhaps mindful of his mother's death in dorne instead commanded tully to summon his banners and lingered at riverrun as they gathered only when a thousand men were assembled did amy's march but when his men reached harrenhal they found it empty but for corpses haron the red had put lord gargan's sermons to the sword and taken his band into the woods by the time annie's returned to king's landing the news had grown even worse in the veil lord ronald aaron's younger brother janos had deposed and imprisoned his loyal sibling and declared himself king of the mountain and vale in the iron islands another priest king had walked out of the sea announcing himself to be lodos the twice drowned the son of the drowned god returned at last from visiting his father and high in the red mountains of dorne a pretender called the vulture king appeared and called on all true dornishmen to avenge the evils visited on dorne by the targaryens though princess daria denounced him swearing that she and all lil dornishmen wanted only peace thousands flocked to his banners swarming down from the hills and up out of the sands through goat tracks and the mountains into the reach this vulture king is half mad and his followers are a rabble undisciplined and unwashed lord harmon donderian wrote to the king we can smell them coming 50 leagues away not long after the selfsame rabble stormed and seized his castle of blackhaven the vulture king personally sliced off dundarian's nose before putting blackhaven to the torch and marching away king aenes knew these rebels had to be put down but seemed unable to decide where to begin grand maester gowan wrote that the king could not comprehend why this was happening the small folk loved him did they not jono's aaron this new lodos the vulture king had he wronged them if they had grievances why not bring them to him i would have heard them out his grace spoke of sending messengers to the rebels to learn the reasons for their actions fearing that king's landing might not be safe with herron the red alive and near he sent queen elissa and their younger children to dragonstone he commanded his hand lord alan stokeworth to take a fleet and army to the vale to put down jonas aaron and restore his brother ronald to lordship but when the ships were about to sail he countermanded the order fearing that stokworth's departure would leave king's landing undefended instead he sent the hand with but a few hundred men to hunt down hare in the red and decided he would summon a great council to discuss how best to put down the other rebels whilst the king prevaricated his lords took to the field some acted on their own authority others in concert with the dowager queen in the veil lord allard royce of runestone assembled two-score loyal bannermen and march against the eerie easily defeating supporters of the self-styled king of mountain and vale but when they demanded the release of the rightful lord jonas aaron sent his brother to them through the moon door such was the sad end of ronald aaron who had flown thrice about the giants lance on dragon back the eerie was impregnable to any conventional assault so king jonos and his die-hard followers spat down defiance at the loyalists and settled in for a siege until prince maegor appeared in the sky above astride balerion the conqueror's younger son had claimed a dragon at last none other than the black dread the greatest of them all rather than face valyrian's fires the eeries garrison seized the pretender and delivered him to lord royce opening the moon door once again and serving jonos the kingslayer as he had served his brother surrender saved the pretenders followers from burning but not from death after taking possession of the erie prince maegor executed them to a man even the highest born amongst them were denied the honor of dying by the sword traitors deserved only a rope maegor decreed so the captured knights were hanged naked from the walls of the eerie kicking as they strangled slowly hubert aaron a cousin to the dead brothers was installed as lord of the vale as he had already sired six sons by his wife a royce of runestone the errant succession was seen to be secure in the iron islands goran greyjoy lord reaper of the pike brought king lodos second of that name to a similar swift end marshaling a hundred longships to descend on old wick and greatwick where the pretenders followers were most numerous and putting thousands of them to the sword afterward he had the head of the priest king pickled in brine and sent to king's landing king aenes was so pleased by the gift that he offered greyjoy any boon he might desire this proved unwise lord goran wishing to prove himself a true son of the drowned god asked the king for the right to expel all the septons and septas who had come to the iron islands after the conquest to convert the ironborn to the worship of the seven king aines had no choice but to agree the largest and most threatening rebellion remained that of the vulture king along the dornish marches though princess daria continued to issue denunciations from sunspear there were many who suspected that she was playing a double game for she did not take the field against the rebels and was rumored to be sending the men money and supplies whether that was true or not hundreds of dornish knights and several thousand seasoned spearmen had joined the vulture king's rabble and the rabble itself had swelled enormously to more than thirty thousand men so large had his host become that the vulture king made an ill-considered decision and defied his strength whilst he marched west against knight song and horn hill with half of the dornish power the other half went east to bestowage stonehelm seat of house swan under the command of lord walter will the son of the widow lover both hosts met with disaster orcs baratheon known now as orris one hand rode fourth from storm's end one last time to smash the dornish beneath the walls of stonehelm when walter will was delivered into his hands wounded but alive lord orris said your father took my hand i claim yours as repayment so saying he hacked off lord walter's sword hand then he took his other hand and both his feet as well calling them his you're siri strange to say lord baratheon died on the march back the storm's end of the wounds he himself had taken during the battle but his son davos always said he died content smiling at the rotting hands and feet that dangled in his tent like a string of onions the vulture king himself fared little better unable to capture night song he abandoned the siege and marched west only to have lady karen sally forth behind him to join up with the strong force of marchers led by harman dondarrion the mutilated lord of blackhaven meanwhile lord samwell tarly of hornhill suddenly appeared a fort the dornish line of march with several thousand knights and archers savage sam that lord was called and so he proved in the bloody battle that ensued cutting down dozens of dornishmen with his great valyrian steel blade heartsbane the vulture king had twice as many men as his three foes combined but most were untrained and undisciplined and when faced with arbor knights at front and rear the ranks shattered throwing down their spears and shields the dornish broken ran making for the distant mountains but the marcher lords rode after them and cut them down in what became known as the vulture hunt as for the rebel king himself the man who called himself the vulture king was taken alive and tied naked between two posts by savage sam tarly the singers like to say that he was torn to pieces by the very vultures from whom he took his style but in truth he perished of thirst and exposure and the birds did not descend on him until well after he was dead in later years several other men would take the title vulture king but whether they were of the same blood as the first no man can say his death is generally accounted as the end of the second dornish war though that is somewhat of a misnomer since no dornish lords ever took the field and princess daria continued to vilify the vulture king until his end and took no part in his campaigns the first of the rebels proved to be the last as well but herron the red was at last brought to bay in a village west of the god's eye the outlaw king did not die meekly in his last fight he slew the king's hand lord alan stokeworth before being cut down by stoke-worth squire bernard brune a grateful king aenes confirmed knighthood on brune and rewarded davos baratheon samwell tarly no-nose dondarrion ellen karen allard royce and goran greyjoy with gold offices and honors the greatest plaudits he bestowed on his own brother on his return to king's landing prince maegor was hailed as a hero king aines embraced him before a cheering throng and named him hand of the king and when two young dragons hatched amidst the fire pits of dragonstone at the end of the year it was taken for a sign but the amity between the dragon's sons did not long endure it may be that conflict was inevitable for the two brothers had very different natures king aines loved his wife children and his people and wished only to be loved in turn sword and lance had lost whatever appeal they had for him instead his grace dabbled in alchemy astronomy and astrology delighted in music and dance were the finest silks somites velvets and enjoyed the company of maesters septons and wits his brother maegor taller broader and fearsomely strong had no patience for any of that but lived for war tornies and battle he was rightly regarded as one of the finest knights in westeros though his savagery in the field and his harshness toward defeated foes was oft remarked upon as well king aines sought always to please when faced with difficulties he would answer with soft words whereas maegor's reply was ever steel and fire grand maester gowan wrote that aines trusted everyone maegor no one the king was easily influenced gowan observed swaying this way and that like a reed in the wind like as not to heed whichever counselor last had his ear prince maegor on the other hand was rigid as iron rod unyielding unbending despite such differences the sons of the dragon continued to rule together amicably for the best part of two years but in 39 ac queen alyssa gave king aenes yet another heir a girl she named via who sadly died in the cradle not long after perhaps it was this continued proof of the queen's fertility that drove prince maegor to do what he did whatever the reason the prince shocked the realm and the king both when he suddenly announced that lady cerese was barren and he had therefore taken a second wife in alice haraway daughter of the new lord of harrenhal the wedding was performed on dragonstone under the aegis of dowager queen visenya as the castle septon refused to officiate maegor and his new bride were joined in a valyrian rite wed by blood and fire the marriage took place without the leave knowledge or presence of king aenes when he became known the two half-brothers quarreled bitterly nor was his grace alone in his wrath manfred hightower father of lady cerese made protests to the king demanding that lady alice be put aside and in the star-cepted old town the high septon went even further denouncing maegor's marriage as sin and fornication and calling the prince's new bride the [ __ ] of howard no true son or daughter of the seven would ever bow to such he thundered prince maegor remained defiant his father had taken both of his sisters to life he pointed out the strictures of the faith might rule lesser men but not the blood of the dragon no words of king aenes could heal the wounds of his brother's words thus opened and many pious lords throughout the seven kingdoms condemned the marriage and began to speak openly of maegor's [ __ ] vexed and angry king aenese gave his brother a choice put alice haraway aside and return to lady cerise or suffer five years of exile prince maegor chose exile in 40 ac he departed for pentos taking lady alice valerian his dragon and the sword blackfyre with him it is said that aenes requested that his brother return blackfyre to which prince makeover replied your grace is welcome to try and take her from me lady cerese was left abandoned in king's landing to replace his brother's hand king aines turned to septin murmison a pious cleric said to be able to heal the sick by laying on of the hands the king had him lay hands on lady cyrese's belly every night in the hopes that his brother might repent his folly if the lawful wife could be made fertile but the lady soon grew weary of the nightly ritual and departed king's landing for old town where she rejoined her father in the hightower no doubt his grace the king hoped the choice would appease the faith if so he was wrong septon murmursing could no more heal the realm then he could make series hightower feckened the high septon continued to thunder and all through the realm the lords in their halls spoke of the king's weakness how could they rule the seven kingdoms when he cannot rule even his brother they said the king remained oblivious to the discontent in his realm peace had returned his troublesome brother was across the narrow sea and a great new castle had begun to rise atop aegon's high hill built all in pale red stone the king's new seat would be larger and more lavish than dragonstone with massive walls and barbicans and towers capable of withstanding any enemy the red keat the people of king's landing named it its building had become the king's obsession my descendants shall rule from here for a thousand years his grace declared perhaps thinking of those descendants in 41ac aeneas targaryen made a disastrous blunder and announced his intention to give the hand of his daughter reina in marriage to her brother aegon heir to the iron throne the princess was 18 the prince 15. they had been close since childhood playmates when young though aegon had never claimed a dragon of his own he had ascended into the skies more than once with his sister on dream fire lean and handsome and growing taller every year aegon was said by many to be the very image of his grandsire at the same age three years of service as a squire had sharpened his prowess with sword and axe and he was widely regarded as the best young lance in all the realm of late many a young maiden had cast her eye upon the prince and aegon was not indifferent to their charms if the prince is not weird grand maester gowan wrote the citadel his grace may soon have a bastard grandchild to contend with princess raina had many a suitor as well but unlike her brother she gave encouragement to none of them she preferred to spend her days with her siblings her dogs and her cats and her newest favorite elaine royce daughter to the lord of runestone a plump and holy girl but so cherished that reina sometimes took her flying on the back of dream fire just as she did her brother aegon more often though reyna took to the skies by herself after her 16th name day the princess declared herself a woman grown free to fly where i will and fly she did dream fire was seen as far away as harrenhal tarth runestone gull town it was whispered though never proved that on one of these flights reina surrendered the flower of her maidenhead to a low-born lover a hedge knight one story had it others named him a singer a blacksmith's son a village septon in the light of these tales some have suggested that aenes might have felt a need to see his daughter wed as soon as possible regardless of the truth that surmised at 18 reyna was certainly of an age to marry three years older than her mother and father had been when they were wed given the traditions and practices of house targaryen a match between his two eldest children must have seemed the obvious course to king aenese the affection between reina and aegon was well known and neither raised any objection to the marriage indeed there is much to suggest that both had been anticipating just such a partnership since they had first played together in the nurseries of dragonstone and the aegon for it the storm that greeted the king's announcement took them all by surprise though the warning signs had been plain enough for those with the wit to read them the faith i condoned or at the very least ignored the marriage of the conqueror and his sisters but it was not willing to do the same for the grandchildren from the starry sept came a blistering condemnation denouncing the marriage of brother the sister as an obscenity any children born of such a union would be abominations in the sights of god and men the father of the faithful proclaimed in a declaration that was read by ten thousand septons throughout the seven kingdoms amy's targaryen was infamous for his indecision yet here faced with the fury of the faith he stiffened and grew stubborn the dowager queen visenya advised him that he had but two choices he must abandon the marriage and find new matches for his son and daughter or mount his dragon quicksilver to fly to old town to burn the starry sep down around the high septon's head king aines didn't either instead he simply persisted on the day of the wedding the streets outside the sept of remembrance built atop the hill of rhaenys and named in honor of the dragon's fallen queen were lined with warrior sons in gleaming silver armor making note of each of the wedding guests as they passed by a foot a horse or in litters the wiser lords perhaps expecting that had stayed away those who did come to bear witness saw more than a wedding at the feast afterward king aenes compounded his misjudgment by granting the title of prince of dragonstone to his presumptive heir prince aegon a hush fell over the hall at those words for all the present knew that the title hitherto belonged to prince maegor at the high table queen visenya rose and stalked from the hall without the king's leave that night she mounted vegar and returned to dragonstone and it is written that when her dragon passed before the moon that orb turned as red as blood aenes targaryen did not seem to comprehend the extent to which he had roused the realm against him eager to win back the favor of the small folk he decreed that the prince and princess would make a royal progress throughout the realm no doubt thinking of the cheers that had greeted him everywhere when he went on his own progress wiser than perhaps her father princess rayna asked his leave to bring her dragon dream fire with them but aenes forbade it as prince aegon had not yet ridden a dragon the king feared that the lords and commons might think his son unmanly if they saw his wife on dragon back and him upon a palfrey the king had grossly misjudged the temper of the kingdom the piety of his people and the power of the high septon's words from the first day they set out aegon and reina and their escort were jeered by crowds of the faithful wherever they went at maidenpool not a single septon could be found to pronounce a blessing at the feast lord mutin threw in their honor when they reached harrenhal lord lucas haraway refused to admit them to his castle unless they agreed to acknowledge his daughter alice as their uncle's true and lawful wife the refusal won them no love from the pious only a cold wet night in tenths beneath the towering walls of black heron's mighty castle at one village in the riverlands several poor fellows went so far as to pelt the royal couple with clods of dirt prince aegon drew his sword to chastise them and had to be restrained by his own knights for the prince's party was greatly outnumbered yet that did not stop princess reyna from writing up to them to say well you're very fearless when facing a girl on a horse i see the next time i come i will come on a dragon third door to me then i pray you elsewhere in the realm matters went from bad to worse septon murmison the king's hand was expelled from the faith in punishment for performing the forbidden nuptials whereupon anes himself took quill in hand to write to the high septon asking that his high holiness restore my good momosen and explaining the long history of brother sister marriages in old valyria the high septon's reply was so venomous that his grace went pale when he read it far from relenting the shepherd of the faithful addressed aines as king abomination declaring him a pretender and a tyrant with no right to rule the seven kingdoms the faithful were listening less than a fortnight later as septon murmison was crossing the city in his litter a group of poor fellows came swarming from an alley and hacked him to pieces with their axes the warrior's sons began to fortify the hill of rhaenys turning the sept of remembrance into their citadel with the red keep still years away from completion the king decided that his mance atop vicenia's hill was too vulnerable and made plans to remove himself to dragonstone with queen elissa and their younger children three days before they were to sail two poor fellows scalded the mance's walls and broke into the king's bedchamber only the timely intervention of the kingsguard saved aenes from an ignoble death his grace was trading vicenia's hill for visenya herself on dragonstone the queen dowager famously greeted him with you are a fool and a weakling nephew do you think any man would ever have dad speak so to your father you have a dragon use him fly to old town and make this starry sept another harrenhal what give me leave and let me roast this pious fool for you aines would not hear of it instead he sent the queen dowager to her chambers in the sea dragon tower and ordered her to remain there by the end of 41ac much of the realm was deep in the throes of a full-fledged rebellion against house targaryen the four false kings who had arisen on the death of aegon the conqueror now seemed like so many posturing fools against the threat posed by this new rising for these rebels believe themselves soldiers of the seven fighting a holy war against godless tyranny dozens of pious lords throughout the seven kingdoms took up the cry pulling down the king's banners and declaring for the starry sept the warrior's son seized the gates of king's landing giving them control over whoever might enter and leave the city and drove the workmen from the unfinished red key thousands of poor fellows took to the roads forcing travelers to declare whether they stood with the gods or the abomination and remonstrating outside castle gates until their lords came forth to denounce the targaryen king in the westerlands prince aegon and princess reyna were forced to abandon their progress and take shelter in krakow castle an envoy from the iron bank of braavos sent to old town to treat with martin hightower the new lord of hightower and voice of old town his father lord manfred having died a few moons earlier wrote home to say that the high septon was the true king of westeros in all but name the coming of the new year found king aine still on dragonstone sick with fear and indecision his grace was but 35 years of age but it was said that he looked like a man of 60 and grand maester gowan reported that he off took to his bed with loose bowels and stomach cramps when none of the grand maestro's curious proved efficacious the dowriger queen took charge of the king's care and amy seemed to improve for a time only to suffer a sudden collapse when the word reached to him that thousands of poor fellows had surrounded krakow where his son and daughter were reluctant guests three days later the king was dead like his father amy targaryen the first of his name was given over to the flames in the yard at dragonstone his funeral was attended by sons of ceres and jiharis twelve and seven years of age respectively and his daughter alisaine five his widow queen elissa sang a dirge for him and his own beloved quicksilver set his pyre a light though it was recorded that the dragons vermithor and silverwing added their own fire to hers queen visenya was not present within an hour of the king's death she had mounted veigar and flown east across the narrow sea when she returned prince maegor was with her on valerian maegor descended on dragonstone only long enough to claim the crown not the ornate golden crown aeneas had favored with its images of the seven but the iron crown of their fathers set with its blood-red rubies his mother placed it on his head and the lords and knights gathered their knelt as he proclaimed himself maegor of house targaryen first of his name king of the andals the ruiner and the first men lord of the seven kingdoms and the protector of the realm only grand maester gowan dared object by all the laws of inheritance laws that the conqueror himself had reaffirmed after the conquest the iron throne should pass to king aene's son aegon the aged maester said the iron throne will go to the man who has the strength to seize it maegor replied whereupon he decreed the immediate execution of the grand maester taking off gowin's old grey head himself with a single swing of blackfyre queen alyssa and her children were not on hand to witness king maegor's coronation she had taken them to dragonstone within hours of her husband's funeral crossing to her lord father's castle on nearby driftmark when told maegor gave a shrug then he retired to the chamber of the painted table with a maester to dictate letters to lords great and small throughout the realm a hundred ravens flew within the day the next day maegor flew as well mounting balerion he crossed blackwater bay to king's landing accompanied by the dowager queen of essegna upon vegar the return of the dragon set off riots in the city as hundreds tried to flee only to find the gates closed and barred the warrior's sons held the city walls the pits and piles of what would be the red keep and the hill of rhaenys where they had made the sept of remembrance their own fortress the targaryens raised their standards atop the visenya's hill and called for leel men to gather to them thousands did vicinia targaryen proclaimed that her son maegor had come to be their king a true king blood of aegon the conqueror who was my brother my husband and my love if any man questions my son's right to the iron throne let him prove his claim with his body the warrior's sons were not slow to accept our challenge down from the hill of rhaenys they rode 700 knights in silvered steel led by their great captain sir damon morrigan called damon the devout let us not be bandy words maegor told him swords will decide this matter so damon agreed the gods would grant victory to the man whose cause was just he said let each side have seven champions as it was done in andalo savold can you find six men to stand by you for aenes had taken the king's guard to dragonstone and maegor stood alone the king turned to the crowd who will come and stand beside his king he called many turned away in fear or pretended that they did not hear for the prowess of the warrior's sons was known to all but at last one man offered himself no knight but a simple man at arms who called himself dick bean i've been a kings man since i was a boy he said i mean to die a king's man only then did the first night step forward this bean shames us all he shouted are there no true knights here no legal men the speaker was bernard brune the squire who had slain hair on the red and been knighted by king aedes himself the names of the four maegor shows are writ large in the history of westeros sir bram of black hole a hedge knight sir rayford rosby sir guy loveston called guy the glutton and sir lucifer massey lord of stone dance the name of the seven warrior sons have likewise come down to us they were sir damon morrigan called damon the devout grand captain of the warriors sons so lyle bracken sir harris horp called death's head harry sir aegon ambrose sir dick on flowers the bastard of beesberry sir william the wanderer and sir garibald of the seven stars the septon knight it is written that damon the devout led a prayer beseeching the warrior to grant strength to their arms afterward the queen dowager gave the command to begin and the issue was joined dickbean died first cut down by lyle bracken mere instance after the combat began thereafter accounts differ markedly one chronicler says that when the hugely fat cirgita glutton was cut open the remains of 40 half-digested pies spilled out another claim sir guarable to the seven stars sang a pin as he fought several tells that lord massey hacked off the arm of harry horp in one account death's head harry tossed his battle axe into the other hand and buried it between lord massey's eyes other chroniclers suggest that sarhara simply died some say the fight went on for hours others that most of the combatants were down and dying in mere moments all agree that the great deeds were done and mighty blows exchanged until the end found maegor targaryen standing alone against damon the devout and william the wanderer both of the warrior sons were badly wounded and his grace had blackfyre in his hand but even so it was a near thing even as he fell sir william dealt the king a terrible blow to the head that cracked his helm and left him insensate many thought maego were dead until his mother removed the broken helm the king breathes she said the king lives the victory was his seven of the mightiest of the warrior sons were dead including their commander but more than 700 remained armed and armored and gathered about the crown of the hill queen visenya commanded her son to be taken to the maesters as the litter-bearers bore him down the hill the swords of the faith dropped to their knees in submission the dowager queen ordered them to return their fortified sept atop the hill of rhaenys for 27 days maegor targaryen lingered at the point of death whilst maesters treated him with potions and poultices and septons prayed above his bed in the sept of remembrance the warrior sons prayed as well and argued about their course some felt the order had no choice but to accept maegor as king since the gods had blessed him with victory others insisted that they were bound by oath to obey the high sept and fight on the king's guard arrived from dragonstone in the nonce at the behest of the dowager queen they took command of the thousands of targaryen loyalists in the city and surrounded the hill of rhaenys on driftmark the widowed queen elissa proclaimed her own son aegon the true king but few heeded her call the young prince just shy of manhood remained at crack hall half a realm away trapped in a castle surrounded by poor fellows and pious peasants most of whom considered him an abomination in the citadel of old town the archmaesters met in conclave to debate the succession and choose a new grand maester thousands of poor fellows streamed toward king's landing those from the west followed the hedge knight sir horus hill those from the south a gigantic axeman called watt the hewer when the ragged bands encamped about krakow left to join their fellows on the march prince aegon and princess reyna were finally able to depart abandoning their royal progress they made their way to casterly rock where lord lyman lannister offered them his protection it was his wife lady jocasta who first discerned that princess reyna was with child lord lymon's maester tells us on the 28th day of the trial of the seven a ship arrived from pentos upon the evening tide carrying two women and 600 sellswords alice of house harroway maegor targaryen's second wife had returned to westeros but not alone with her sailed another woman a pale raven-haired beauty known only as tyanna of the tower some said the woman was maegor's concubine others named her lady alice's paramour the natural daughter of a pentoshi magister tayana was a tavern dancer who had risen to be a courtesan she was rumored to be a poisoner and sorceress as well many queer tales were told about her yet as soon as she arrived queen visenya dismissed her son's maesters and septons and gave maegor over to tiana's care the next morning the king awoke rising with the sun when maegor appeared on the walls of the red keep standing between alice haraway and tyanna of pentos the crowds cheered wildly and the city erupted in celebration but the rebels died away when maegor mounted valerion and descended upon the hill of rhaenys where 700 of the warrior sons were at their morning prayers in the fortified sept as dragon fire set the building aflame archers and spearmen waited outside for those who came bursting through the doors it was said the screams of the burning men could be heard throughout the city and a pawl of smoke lingered over king's landing for days thus did the cream of the warrior's sons meet their fiery end though other chapters remained in old town lannisport goldtown and the stony sept the order would never again approach its former strength king maegor's war against the faith militant had just begun however it would continue for the remainder of his reign the king's first act upon ascending the iron throne was to command the poor fellows swarming toward the city to lay down their weapons under penalty of prescription and death when his decree had no effect his grace commanded allele lords to take to the field and disperse the faith's ragged hordes by force in response the high septon in old town called upon true and pious children of the gods to take up arms in defense of the faith and put an end to the reign of dragons and monsters and abominations battle was joined first in the reach at the town of stonebridge there nine thousand poor fellows under watt the huer found themselves caught between six lordly hosts as they attempted to cross the mandar with half his men north of the river and half on the south what's army was cut to pieces his untrained and undisciplined followers clad in boiled leather rough spun and scraps of rusted steel and armed largely with woodsman's axes sharpened sticks and farm implements proved utterly unable to stand against the charge of armored knights on heavy horses so grievous was the slaughter that the mandar ran red for 20 leagues and thereafter the town and castle where the battle had been fought became known as bitterbridge watt himself was taken alive though not before slaying half a dozen knights amongst them lord meadows of grassy vale commander of the king's host the giant was delivered to king's landing and chains by then saw horace hill had reached the great fork of the black water with an even larger host close on 13 000 poor fellows the ranks stiffened by the addition of 200 mounted warriors knights from the stony sept and the household knights and feudal levees of a dozen rebel lords from the westerlands and the riverlands lord rupert falwell famed as the fighting fool led the ranks of the pious who had answered the high septon's call with him rode sir lionel lorch sir alan tarik lord christopher wayne lord john lychester and many other presidents knights the army of the faithful numbered twenty thousand men king maegor's army was of like size however and his grace had almost twice as much armored horse as well as a large contingent of long bowmen and the king himself riding belierion even so the battle proved a savage struggle the fighting full slew two knights of the kingsguard before he himself was cut down by the lord of maidenpool big john hogg fighting for the king was blinded by a sword slash early in the battle yet rallied his men and led a charge that broke through the lines of the faithful and put the poor fellows to flight a rainstorm dampened valyrian's fires but could not quench them entirely and amidst smoke and screams king maegor descended again and again to serve his foes with flame by nightfall victory was his as the remaining poor fellows threw down their axes and streamed away in all directions triumphant maegor returned to king's landing to seed himself once more upon the iron throne when what the hewer was delivered to him chained yet still defiant maegor took off his limbs with the giant's own axe but commanded his maceras to keep the man alive so he might attend my wedding then his grace announced his intent to take tyanna of pentos as his third wife though it was whispered that his mother the queen dowager had no love for the pentoshi sorceress only grand maester miros dared to speak against her openly your one true life awaits you in the high tower miro said the king heard him out in silence then descended from the throne drew blackfire and slew him where he stood maegor targaryen and tyanna of the tower were wed atop the hill of rhaenys amidst the ash and bones of the warrior's sons who had died there it was said that maegor had to put a dozen septance to death before he found one willing to perform the ceremony what the hewer limbless was kept alive to witness the marriage king annie's widow queen elissa was present as well with her younger sons viserys and jiharis and her daughter alisain a visit from the dallagar queen and vegar had persuaded her to leave her sanctuary on driftmark and return to court where alyssa and her brothers and cousins of house velaryon did homage to maegor as the true king the widowed queen was even compelled to join the other ladies of the court in disrobing his grace and escorting him to the nuptial chamber to consummate his marriage a betting ceremony presided over by the king's second wife alice haraway that task done alyssa and the other ladies took their leave of the royal bedchamber but aus remained joining the king and his newest wife in a night of carnal lust across the realm in old town the high septon was loud in his denunciations of the abomination and his [ __ ] whilst the king's first wife series of house hightower continued to insist that she was maegor's only lawful queen and in the westerlands aegon targaryen prince of dragonstone and his wife princess reyna remained defiant as well all through the turmoil of maegor's ascension king amy's son and the princess his wife had remained a casterly rock where reina grew great with child most of the knights and young lordlings who had set out with them on their ill-fated progress had abandoned them rushing off to king's landing to bend their knees to maegor even reina's handmaids and companions had found excuses to absent themselves save for her friend elena royce and a former favorite melanie piper who arrived at lannisport with her brothers to swear loyalty to their house all his life prince aegon had been considered the heir presumptive to the iron throne but now suddenly he found himself reviled by the pious and abandoned by many he had thought to be his real friends maegor's supporters who seemed more numerous every day were not shy in saying that aegon was his father's son suggesting that they saw him in the same weakness that had brought down king aenes aegon had never ridden a dragon they pointed out whereas maegor had claimed valerion and the prince's own bride princess raina had been flying dream fires since the age of 12. queen eliza's attendance at maegor's wedding was trumpeted as proof that aegon's own mother had abandoned his cause though lyman lannister lord of casterly rock stood firm when maegor demanded that aegon and his sister be returned to king's landing in chains if need be even he would not go as far to pledge a sword to the youth who now found himself being called the pretender and aegon the uncrowned and thus it was there at casually rock that princess rayna gave birth to aegon's daughters twins they named era and raela from the starry sept came another blistering proclamation these children too were abominations the high septim proclaimed fruits of lust and incest accursed of the gods the mastery of casually rock who helped deliver the children tells us that afterward princess raina begged the prince her husband to take them all across the narrow sea to tyrosh or mir or volantis anywhere beyond their uncle's reach for i would godly give up my own life to make you king but i will not put out girls at risk but her words fell on stony ears and her tears were shed in vain for prince aegon was determined to claim his birthright the dawn of the year 43ac found king maegor in king's landing where he had taken personal charge of the construction of the red keep much of the finished work was now undone or changed new builders and workmen were brought in and secret passages and tunnels crept through the depths of aegon's high hill as the redstone towers rose the king commanded the building of a castle within the castle a fortified redoubt surrounded by a dry moat that would soon be known as maegor's holdfast in that same year maegor made lord lucas haraway father of his wife queen alice his new hands but it was not the hand who had been the king's ear his grace might rule the seven kingdoms men whispered but he himself was ruled by three queens his mother queen visenya his paramour queen alice and the pentoshi witch queen tayana the mistress of whispers tyanna was called and the king's raven for her black hair she spoke with rats and spiders it was said and all the vermin of king's landing came to her by night to tell tales of any fool rash enough to speak against the king thousands of poor fellows still haunted the roads and wild places of the reach the trident and the vale though they would never again assemble in large numbers to face the king in open battle the stars fought on in smaller ways falling upon travelers and swarming over towns villages and poorly defended castles slaying the king's loyalists wherever they found them sir horus hill had escaped the battle at great fork but defeat and flight had tarnished him and his followers were few the new leaders of the poor fellows were men like ragged silas septon moon and dennis the lame hardly distinguishable from outlaws one of their most vicious captains was a woman named poxy jane poore whose savage followers made the woods between king's landing and storm's end all but impassable to honest travelers meanwhile the warriors sons had chosen a new grand captain in the person of sir joffrey doggett the red dog of the hills who was determined to restore order to its former glory when sir joffrey set out from lannisport to seek the blessing of the high septon a hundred men rode with him by the time he arrived in old town so many knights and squires and free riders had joined him that his numbers had swollen to two thousand elsewhere in the realm other restless lords and men of faith were gathering men as well and plotting ways to bring the dragons down none of this had gone unnoticed ravens flew to every corner of the realm summoning lords and landed knights of doubtful loyalty to king's landing to bend the knee swear homage and deliver a son or daughter as hostage for their obedience the stars and swords were outlawed membership in either order would henceforth be punishable by death the high septon was commanded to deliver himself to the red keep to stand trial for high treason his high holiness responded from the star except commanding the king to present himself in old town to beg the forgiveness of the gods for his sins and cruelties many of the faithful echoed his defiance some pious lords did travel to king's landing to do homage and present hostages but more did not trusting to their numbers and the strength of their castles to keep them safe king maegor let the poisons fester for almost half a year so engrossed was he in the building of his red keep it was his mother who struck first the dowager queen mounted veigar and brought fire and blood to the riverlands as she once did to dorne in a single night the seats of house blanetree house tarik house deadings house lychester and house wayne were set aflame then maegor himself took wing flying belarion to the westerlands where he burned the castles of the brooms the falwells the lorches and the other pious lords who had defied his summons lastly he descended upon the seat of house doggett reducing it to ash the fires claimed the lives of sir joffrey's father mother and younger sister along with their sworn swords serving men and chateau as pillars of smoke rose all through the westerlands and the riverlands vegar and valerion turned south another lord hightower councilled by another high septon had opened the gates of old town during the conquest but now it seemed as if the greatest and most populous city in westeros must surely burn thousands fled old town that night streaming from the city gates or taking ship for distant ports thousands more took to the streets in drunken revelry this is a night for song and sing and drink men told one another for now come the morrow the virtuous and the vile burn together others gathered in seps and temples and ancient woods to pray they might be spared in the starry sept the high septon railed and thundered calling down the wrath of the gods upon the targaryens the archmaesters of the citadel met in conclave the men of the city watch filled sacks with sand and pails with water to fight the fires they knew were coming along the city walls crossbows scorpions spitfires and spear throwers were hoisted onto the battlements in hopes of bringing down the dragons when they appeared led by sir morgan hightower a younger brother of the lord of old town 200 warrior sons spilled forth from their chapter house to defend his high holiness surrounding the starry sept with a ring of steel atop the hightower the great beacon fire turned a baleful green as lord martin hightower called his banners oldtown waited for the dawn and the coming of the dragons and the dragons came vegar first as the sun was rising then balerion just before midday but they found the gates of the city open the battlements unmanned and the banners of house targaryen house tyrell and house hightower flying side by side atop the city walls the dowager queen visenya was the first to learn the news sometime during the blackest hours of that long and dreadful night the high septon had died a man of three and fifty as tireless as he was fearless and to all appearances in robust good health this high septon had been renowned for his strength more than once he had preached day and night without taking sleep or nourishment his sudden death shocked the city and dismayed his followers its causes are debated to this day some say that his high holiness took his own life in what was either the act of a craven afraid to face the wrath of king maegor or a noble sacrifice to spare the good folk of old town from dragonfire others claim the seven struck him down for the sin of pride for heresy treason and arrogance many and more remain certain he was murdered but by whom sir morgan hightower did the deed at the command of his lord brother some say and sir morgan was seen entering and leaving the high septon's privy chambers that night others point to the lady patrice hightower lord martin's maiden aunt and reputed witch who did indeed seek an audience with his high holiness at dusk though he was alive when she departed the archmages of the citadel are also suspected though whether they made use of the dark arts an assassin or a poison scroll is still a matter of some debate messages went back and forth between the citadel and the starry sept all night and there are still others who hold them all blameless and lay the high septon's death at the door of another rumored sorceress the dowager queen visenya targaryen the truth will never likely be known but the swift reaction of lord martin when word reached him at the hightower is beyond dispute at once he dispatched his own knights to disarm and arrest the warrior's sons amongst them his own brother the city gates were opened and targaryen banners raised along the walls even before vegard's wings were sighted lord hightower's men were rousting the most devout from their beds and marching them to the starry sept at spear point to choose a new high septon it required but its single ballot almost as one the wise men and women of the faith turn to a certain septon paider 90 years old blind stooped and feeble but famously amiable the new hyseptin almost collapsed beneath the weight of the crystal crown when it was placed upon his head but when maegor targaryen appeared before him in the starry sept he was only too pleased to bless him as king and anoint his head with holy oils even if he did forget the words of the blessing queen vicenja soon returned to dragonstone with vegar but king maegor remained in old town for almost half the year holding court and presiding over trials to the captive swords of the warrior sons a choice was given those who announced their allegiance to the order would be permitted to travel to the wall and live out their days as brothers of the night's watch those who refuse could die as martyrs to their faith three quarters of the captives chose to take the black the remainder died seven of their number famous knights and the sons of the lords were given the honor of having king maegor himself remove their heads with blackfyre the rest of the condemned were beheaded by their former brothers in arms of all their number only one man received a full royal pardon sir morgan hightower the new high septon formally dissolved both the warriors sons and the poor fellows commanding the remaining members to lay down their arms in the name of the gods the seven had no more need of warriors proclaimed the high holiness henceforth the iron throne would protect and defend the faith king maegor granted the surviving members of the faith militant until year's end to surrender their weapons and give up the rebellious ways after that those who remain defiant would find a bounty on their heads a gold dragon for the head of any unrepentant warrior's son a silver stag for the lice-ridden scalp of a poor fellow the new high septon did not dimur nor did the most devout during his time at old town the king was also reconciled with his first wife queen cerese the sister of his host lord hightower her grace agreed to accept the king's otherwise to treat them with respect and honor and speak no further ill against them whilst maegor swore to restore cerise all rights incomes and privileges due to her as wedded wife and queen a great feast was held at hightower to celebrate their reconciliation the revels included a betting and a second consummation so all men would know this to be a true and loving union how long king maegor might have lingered at old town cannot be known for in the latter part of 43ac another challenge to his throne arose his grace's long absence from king's landing had not gone unnoticed by his nephew and prince aegon was quick to seize the chance emerging at last from casterly rock aegon the uncrowned and his wife reina raced across the riverlands with a handful of companions and entered the city concealed beneath sacks of corn with so few followers aegon dared not to seat himself upon the iron throne for he knew he could not hold it they were there for reina's dream fire and so the prince might claim his father's dragon quicksilver in this bold endeavor they were aided by friends in maegor's own court who had grown weary of the king's cruelties the prince and princess entered king's landing in a wagon pulled by mules but when they made their departure it was on dragon back flying side by side from there aegon and reyna returned to the westerlands to assemble an army as the lannisters of casterly rock were still reluctant to openly espouse prince aegon's cause his adherents gathered at pink maiden's castle seat of house piper john piper lord of pink maiden had pledged this sword to the prince but it was wildly believed that it was his fiery sister melanie reina's girlhood friend who won him to the cause it was there at pink maiden that aegon targaryen mounted on quicksilver descended from the sky to denounce his uncle as a tyrant and usurper and call upon all honest men to rally his banners the lords and knights who came were largely western men and riverlords the lords tarback root vance charlton frey paige perrin farman and westerling were amongst them together with lord corbrey of the vale the bastard of baroton and the fourth son of the lord of griffin's roost from lannisport came 500 men under the banner of a bastard son of lyman lannister sir tyler hill by which ploy the cunning lord of castley rock lent supporters to the young prince while still keeping his own hands clean should maegor prevail the piper levees were led not by lord john or his brothers but by their sister melanie who donned man's mail and took up a spear fifteen thousand men had joined the rebellion as aegon the uncrowned began his march across the riverlands to stake his claim to the iron throne led by the prince himself on king amy's beloved dragon quicksilver though their ranks included season commanders and precent knights no great lords had rallied to prince aegon's cause but queen tyanna mistress of whispers wrote to warn maegor that storm's end the eerie winterfell and casually rock had all been in secret communication with his brother's widowed queen alyssa before declaring for the prince of dragonstone they wished to be convinced he might prevail prince aegon required a victory maegor denied him that from harrenhal came forth lord haraway from riverrun lord tully sir davos darklin of the kingsguard marshaled five thousand swords in king's landing and struck out west to meet the rebels up from the reach came lord peak lord meriwether lord caswell and their levees prince aegon's slow moving host found armies closing from all sides each smaller than their own force but so many that the young prince still bit 17 did not know where to turn lord corbray advised him to engage each foe separately before they could join their powers but aegon was loath to divide his strength instead he chose to march on towards king's landing just south of the god's eye he found davos darklin's kingslanders a fort his path sitting on high ground behind a wall of spears even as scouts reported lords meriwether and caswell advancing from the south and lords tully and haraway from the north prince aegon commanded a charge hoping to break through the king's landers before the other loyalists fell upon his flanks and mounted quicksilver to lead the attack himself but scarce he had taken wing when he heard shouts and saw his men below pointing to where valerion the black dread had appeared in the southern sky king maegor had come for the first time since the doom of valyria dragon contended with dragon in the sky even as battle was joined below quicksilver a quarter the size of balerion was no match for the older fiercer dragon and her pale white fireballs were engulfed and washed away in great gouts of black flame then the black dread fell upon her from above his jaws closing around her neck as he ripped one wing from her body screaming and smoking the young dragon plunged through the earth and prince aegon with her the battle below was a nigh as brief if bloodier once aegon fell the rebels saw their cause was doomed and ran discarding arms and armor as they fled but the loyalist armies were all around them and there was no escape by day's end two thousand of aegon's men had died against a hundred of the kings amongst the dead were lord alan tarback dennis snow the bastard of barrowton lord ronald vance sir william whistler melanie piper and three of her brothers and the prince of dragonstone aegon the uncrowned of house targaryen the only notable loss amongst the loyalists was sir davis darklin of the kingsguard slain at the hands of lord corbray with lady forlorn half a year of trials and executions followed queen visenya persuaded her son to spare some of the rebellious lords but even those who kept their lives lost lands and titles and were forced to give up hostages one notable name could be found neither amongst the dead nor captive reina targaryen sister and wife to prince aegon had not joined the host whether that was by his command or her own choice is still debated to this day all that is known for certain is that reyna remained at pink maiden castle with her daughters when aegon marched and with her dream fire would the addition of a second dragon to the prince's host have made a difference when battle was joined we shall never know though it has been pointed out and rightly that princess reyna was no warrior and dreamfire was younger and smaller than quicksilver and certainly no true threat to valerie in the black dread when word of the battle reached the west and princess reyna learned that both her husband and her friend lady melanie had fallen it is said she heard the news in a stoney silence will you not weep she was asked to wish she replied i do not have time for tears whereupon fearing her uncle's wrath she gathered up her daughters arya and raela and fled farther first atlanta's port and then across the sea to faire isle where the new lord mark farman whose father and elder brother had both perished in the battle fighting for prince aegon gave her sanctuary and swore no harm would come to her beneath his roof for the best part of a year the people of fair isle watched the eastern dread fearing the sight of balerion's dark wings but maegor never came instead the victorious king returned to the red keep where he grimly set about getting himself an heir the 44th year after the conquest was a peaceful one compared to what had gone on before but the maesters who chronicled those times wrote that the smell of blood and fire still hung heavy in the air maegor the first targaryen sat on the iron throne as his red keep rose around him but court was grim and cheerless despite the presence of his three queens or perhaps because of it each night he summoned one of his wives to his bed yet he still remained childless with no heir but for the sons and daughters of his brother aines maegor the cruel he was called and kinslayer as well though was death to say either in his hearing in old town the ancient high septon died and another was raised up in his place though he spoke no word against the king or his queens the enmity between king maegor and the faith endured hundreds of poor fellows had been hunted down in slain their scalps delivered to the king's men for the bounty but thousands more still roamed in the woods and hedges and wild places of the seven kingdoms cursing the targaryens with their every breath one band even crowned their own high septon in the person of a bearded brute named septon moon and if you were your son still endured led by sir joffrey doggett the red dog of the hills outlawed and condemned the order no longer had the strength to meet the king's men in open battle so the red dog sent them out in the guise of hedge knights to hunt and slay targaryen loyalists and traitors to the faith the first victim was sir morgan hightower late of their order cut down and butchered on the road to honey hole old lord meriwether was the next to die followed by lord pique's son and heir davos darklin's age father even blind john hogg though the bounty for the head of a warrior's son was a golden dragon the small folk and peasants of the realm hid and protected them remembering what they had been on dragonstone the dowager queen visenya had grown thin and haggard the flesh melting from her bones queen also remained on the island as well with her son jaharis and her daughter alisaine prisoners in all but name prince viserys the eldest surviving son of aenes and alyssa was summoned to court by his grace a promising lad of 15 years beloved of the commons viserys was made squire to the king with a kingsguard knight for a shadow to keep him well away from plots and treasons for a brief while in 44ac it seemed as if the king might soon have that son he desired so desperately queen alice announced she was with child and the court rejoiced grand maester desmond confined her grace to her bed as she grew great with child and took charge of her care assisted by two septas a midwife and the queen's sisters jane and hannah maegor insisted that the other wives serve his pregnant queen as well during the third moon of her confinement however lady alice began to bleed heavily from the womb and lost the child when king maegor came to see the stillbirth he was horrified to find the boy a monster with twisted limbs a huge head and no eyes this cannot be my son he roared in anguish his grief turned to fury and he ordered the immediate execution of the midwife and septus who in charge of the queen's care and grand maester desmond as well sparing only alice's sisters it is said that maegor was seated on the iron throne with the head of the grand maester in his hands when queen tyanna came to tell him he had been deceived the child was not his seed seeing queen cerise returned to court old and bitter and childless alice haraway had begun to fear that the same fate awaited her unless she gave the king a son so she had turned her lord father the hand of the king on the nights when the king was sharing a bed with queen cerise or queen tayana lucas haraway sent men to his daughter's bed to get her with child maegor refused to believe he told tayana she was jealous witch and baron throwing the grandmaster's head at her spiders do not lie the mistress of the whispers replied she handed the king a list written there were the names of 20 men alleged to have given their seed to queen alice old men and young handsome men and homely ones knights and squires lords and servants even grooms and smiths and singers the king's hand had cast a wide net it seemed the men had only one thing in common all were men of proven potency known to have fathered healthy children under torture all but two confessed one a father of 12 still had the gold paid to him by lord haraway for his services the questioning was carried out swiftly and secretly so lord haraway and queen owls had no inkling of the king's suspicions until the kingsguard burst in on them dragged from her bed queen alice saw her sisters killed before her eyes as they tried to protect her her father inspecting the tower of the hand was flung from its roof to smash upon the stones below haraway's sons brothers and nephews were taken as well thrown onto the spikes that lined the dry moat around maegor's holdfast some took hours to die the simple-minded horus haraway lingered for days the 20 names on queen tiana's list soon joined them and then another dozen men named by the first 20. the worst death was reserved for queen alice herself who was given over to her sister wife tyanna for torment of her death we will not speak for some things are best buried and forgotten suffice it to say that her dying took the best part of a fortnight and that maegor himself was present for all of it a witness to her agony after her death the queen's body was cut into seven parts and her pieces mounted on spikes above the seven gates of the city where they've remained until they rotted king maegor himself departed king's landing assembling a strong force of knights and men at arms and marching on harrenhal to complete the destruction of house haraway the great castle of the gods eye was lightly held and its castilian a nephew of lord lucas and cousin to the late queen opened his gates at the king's approach surrender did not save him his grace put the entire garrison to the sword along with every man woman and child he found to have any drop of haraway blood then he marched to lord haraway's town on the trident and did the same there in the aftermath of the bloodletting men began to say that harrenhal was cursed for every lordly house to hold it had come to a bad and bloody end nonetheless many ambitious king's men covered black heron's mighty seat with its broad and fertile lands so many that king maegor grew weary of their entries and decreed that harrenhal should go to the strongest of them thus did 23 knights of the king's household fight with sword and mace and lance amidst the blood-soaked streets of lord haraway's town sir walton towers emerged victorious and maegor himself made him lord of harrenhal but the melee had been a savage afraid and sir walton did not live long enough to enjoy his lordship dying of his wounds within the fortnight harrenhal passed to his eldest son though its domains were much diminished as the king granted lord haraway's town to lord alton butterwell and the rest of haraway holdings to lord darnold derry when at last maegor returned to king's landing to seed himself again upon the iron throne he was greeted with news that his mother queen vicenja had died moreover in the confusion that followed the death of the queen dowager queen alyssa and her children had made their escape from dragonstone with the dragon's vermithor and silverwing to where no man could say they had gone even as far to steal dark sister as they fled his grace ordered his mother's body burned her bones and ashes interred beside those of the conqueror then he sent his kingsguard to seize the squire prince viserys train him in a black cell and question him sharply maegor commanded ask him where his mother has gone he may not know protested sir owen bush a night of maegor's kingsguard then let him die the king answered famously perhaps the [ __ ] will turn up for his funeral prince vasaris did not know where his mother had gone not even when tiana pentos plied him with her dark arts after nine days of questioning he died his body was left out in the ward of the red key for a fortnight at the king's command let his mother come claim him maegor said the queen elisa never appeared and at last his grace consigned his nephew to the fire the prince was 15 years old when he was killed and had been much loved by small folk and lords alike the realm wept for him in 45 ac construction finally came to an end on the red keep king maegor celebrated its completion by feasting the builders and workmen who had labored on the castle sending them wagon loads of strong wine and sweet meats and horse from the city's finest brothels the revels lasted for three days afterward the kings and knights moved in and put all the workmen to the sword to prevent them from ever revealing the red keeps secrets their bones were interred beneath the castle that they had built not long after the completion of the castle queen cerise was stricken with a sudden illness and passed away a rumor went around the court that her grace had given a fence to the king with a shrewish remark so he had commended sir owen to remove her tongue as the tail went the queen had struggled sir owen's knife had slipped and the queen's throat had been slit though never proven the story was widely believed at the time today however most masters believe it to be a slander concocted by the king's enemies to further blacken his repute whatever the truth the death of his first wife left maegor with but a single queen the black-haired black-hearted pentoshi woman tyanna mistress of the spiders who was hated and feared by all hardly had the last stone been sent on the red keep when maegor commanded that the ruins of the sept of remembrance be cleared from the top of rainey's hill and with them the bones and ashes of the warrior sons who had perished there in their place he decreed a great stone stable for dragons would be erected a layer worthy of belereon vegar and their get thus commenced the building of the dragon pit perhaps unsurprisingly it proved difficult to find builders stone masons and laborers to work on the project so many men ran off that the king was finally forced to use prisoners from the city's dungeons as his workforce under the supervision of builders brought in from mir and volantis late in the year 45 ac king maegor took the field once again to continue his war against the outlawed remnants of the faith militant leaving queen tayana to rule king's landing together with the new hand lord edwell celtigar in the great woods south of the blackwater the king's forces hunted down scores of poor fellows who had taken refuge there sending many to the wall and hanging those who refuse to take the black their leader the woman known as poxy jane poor continued to elude the king until at last she was betrayed by three of her own followers who received pardons and knighthoods as the reward three septons traveling with his grace declared poxyjane a witch and maegor ordered her to be burned alive in a field beside the wind water when the day appointed for her execution came 300 of her followers poor fellows and peasants at all burst from the woods to rescue her the king had anticipated this however and his men were ready for the attack the rescuers were surrounded and slaughtered amongst the last to die was their leader who proved to be sir horus hill the bastard hedge knight who escaped the carnage at the great fork three years earlier this time he proved less fortunate elsewhere in the realm however the tide of the times had begun to turn against the king the small folk and lords alike had come to despise him for his many cruelties and many began to give help and comfort to his enemies septon moon the high septon raised up by the poor fellows against the man in old town they called high lickspittle roam the riverlands and reach at will drawing huge crowds whenever he emerged from the woods to preach against the king the hill country north of the golden tooth was ruled in all but named by the red dog sir joffrey doggett self-proclaimed grand captain of the warriors sons neither castley rock nor riverrun seemed inclined to move against him dennis the lame and ragged silas remained at large and wherever they roamed small folk helped keep them safe knights and men at arms sent out to bring them to justice oft vanished in 46 ac king maegor returned to the red key with 2 000 skulls the fruits of a year of campaigning they were the heads of poor fellows and warrior sons he announced as he dumped them out beneath the iron throne but it was widely believed that many of these grizzly trophies belonged to simple crafters field hands and swine hearts guilty of no crime but faith the coming of the new year found maegor still without a son not even a bastard who might be legitimized nor did it seem likely that queen tyanna would give him the air that he desired while she continued to serve his grace as mistress of whispers the king no longer sought her bed it was past time for him to take up a new wife maegor's counselors agreed but they parted ways on who that wife should be grand maester benifer suggested a match with the proud and lovely lady of starfall clarice stain in hopes of detaching her lands and house from dorne alton butterwell master of coin offered his widowed sister a stout woman with seven children though admittedly no beauty he argued her fertility had been proved beyond a doubt the king's hand lord sultagar had two young maiden daughters 13 and 12 years of age respectively he urged the king to take his pick of them or marry both if you preferred lord velaryon of driftmark advised maegor to send for his niece reina the widow of aegon the uncrowned by taking her to wife maegor could unite their claims prevent any fresh rebellions from gathering around her and acquire a hostage against any plots that her mother queen alyssa might foment king maegor listened to each man in turn though in the end he scorned most of the women they put forward some of the reasons and arguments took root in him he would have a woman of proven fertility he decided though not butterwell's fat and homely sister he would take more than one wife as lord saltikar urged two wives would double his chances of getting a son three wives would triple it and one of those wives should surely be his niece there was wisdom in lord valerion's counsel queen alyssa and her two youngest children remained in hiding it was thought that they had fled across the narrow sea to tyrosh or perhaps volantis but they still represented a threat to maegor's crown and any son he might father taking annie's daughter to wife would weaken any claims put forward by her younger siblings after the death of her husband and her flight to fair isle reina targaryen had acted quickly to protect her daughters if prince aegon had truly been the king by law his eldest daughter aria stood his heir and might therefore claim to be the rightful queen of the seven kingdoms but arya and her sister raela were barely a year old and reyna knew that to trumpet such claims would be tantamount to condemning them to death instead she dyed their hair changed their names and sent them from her entrusting them to certain powerful allies who would see them fostered in good homes by worthy men who would have no inkling of their true identities even their mother must not know where the girls were going the princess insisted what she did not know she could not reveal even under torture no such escape was possible for reina targaryen herself though she could change her name dye her hair and garp herself in a tavern wench's rough spun or the robes of a septa there was no disguising her dragon dreamfire was a slender pale blue she dragon with silvery markings who had already produced two clutches of eggs and rayna had been riding her since the age of 12. dragons are not easily hidden instead the princess took them both as far from maegor as she could to fair isle where mark farman granted her the hospitality of fair castle with its tall white towers rising above the sunset sea and there she rested reading praying wondering how long she'd be given before her uncle sent for her brainerd never doubted that he would she said afterward it was a question of when not if the summons came sooner than she would have liked though not as soon as she might have feared there was no question of defiance that would only bring the king down on fair isle with belirion reyna had grown fond of lord farman and more than fond of his second son andrew she would not repay their kindness with fire and blood she mounted dream fire and flew to the red keep where she learned that she must marry her uncle her husband's killer and there as well rayna met her fellow brides for this was to be a triple wedding lady jane of house westerling had been married to alan tarbeck who had died with prince aegon in the battle beneath the god's eye a few months later she had given her late lord a posthumous son tall and slender with lustrous brown hair lady jane was being courted by a younger son of the lord of casually rock when maegor sent for her but this meant little and less to the king more troubling was the case of lady eleanor of house costain the wife of sir theo bowling a landed knight who had fought for the king in his last campaign against the poor fellows though only 19 lady eleanor had already given bowling three sons when the king's eye fell upon her the youngest boy was still at her breast when sir theo was arrested by the kingsguard and charged with conspiring with queen elissa to murder the king and place the boy jaharis on the iron throne though bowling protested his innocence he was found guilty and beheaded the same day king maegor gave his widow seven days to mourn in honor of the gods then summoned her to tell her they would marry at the town of stoney sept septon moon denounced king maegor's wedding plans and hundreds of town folk cheered wildly but few others dared to raise their voices against his grace the high septon took ship at old town sailing to king's landing to perform the marriage rights on a warm spring day in the 47th year after the conquest maegor targaryen took three wives in the ward of the red key though each of his new queens was garbed and cloaked in the colors of her father's house the people of king's landing called them the black brides for all were widows the presence of lady jane's son and lady eleanor's three boys at the wedding ensured that they would play their parts in the ceremony but there were many who expected some show of defiance from princess rayna such hopes were quelled when queen tyanna appeared escorting two young girls with silver hair and purple eyes clad in the red and black of house targaryen you were foolish to think you could hide them from me tyanna told the princess reina bowed her head and spoke her vows in a voice as cold as ice many queer and contradictory stories are told of the night that followed and with the passage of so many years it is difficult to separate truth from legends did the three black brides share a single bed as some claim it seemed unlikely did his grace visit all three women during the night and consummate all three unions perhaps did princess raina attempt to kill the king with a dagger concealed beneath her pillows as she later claimed did eleanor costain scratch the king's back to bloody ribbons as they coupled did jane westerling drink the fertility potion that queen tyanna supposedly brought her or throw it in the older woman's face was such a potion ever mixed or offered the first account of it does not appear until well into the reign of king jiharis 20 years after both women were dead this we know in the aftermath of the wedding maegor declared reina's daughter arya his lawful heir until such time as the gods grant me a son while sending her twin rhaella to old town to be raised as a scepter his nephew jiharis the rightful heir by all the laws of the seven kingdoms was expressly disinherited in the same decree queen jane's son was confirmed as lord of tarbach hall and sent to casterly rock to be raised as a ward of lyman lannister queen eleanor's elder boys were similarly disposed of one to the eerie one to highgarden the queen's youngest babe was turned over to a wet nurse as the king found the queen's nursing irksome half a year later edwell sultagar the king's hand announced that queen jane was with child hardly had her belly begun to swell when the king himself revealed that queen eleanor was also pregnant maegor showered both women with gifts and honors and granted new lands in offices to their fathers brothers and uncles but his joy proved to be short-lived three moons before she was due queen jane was brought to bed by a sudden onset of labor pains and was delivered of a stillborn child as monstrous as the one alice haraway had birthed a legless and armless creature possessed of both male and female genitalia nor did the mother long survive the child maegor was cursed men said he had slain his nephew made war against the faith in the high septon defied the gods committed murder and incest adultery and rape his privy parts were poisoned his seed full of worms the gods would never grant him a living son or so the whispers ran maegor himself settled on a different explanation and sent sir owen bush and sir maladon moore to seize queen tyanna and deliver her to the dungeons there the pentoshi queen made a full confession even as the king's torturers readied their implements she had poisoned jane westerling's child in the womb just as she had al's hairaways it would be the same with eleanor costain's whelp she promised it is said that the king slew her himself cutting out her heart with blackfyre and feeding it to his dogs but even in death tyanna of the tower had her revenge where it came to pass the as she had promised the moon turned and turned again and in the black of night queen eleanor was too delivered of a malformed and stillborn child an eyeless boy born with rudimentary wings that was the 48th year after the conquest the sixth year of king marygore's reign and the last year of his life no man in the seven kingdoms could doubt that the king was a curse now what followers still remained to him began to melt away evaporating like dew in the morning sun word reached king's landing that sir joffrey doggett had been seen entering river run not as a captive but as a guest of lord tully septon moon appeared once more leading thousands of the faithful on a march across the reach to old town with the announced intent of bearding the lick spittle in the starry sep to demand that he denounce the abomination on the iron throne and lift his ban on military orders when lord oakheart and lord rowan appeared before them with their levees they came not to attack moon but to join him lord celtigar resigned his king's hand and returned to a seat on claw isle reports from the dornish marches suggested that the dornishmen were gathering in the passes preparing to invade the realm the worst blow came from storm's end there on the shores of shipbreaker bay lord rogar baratheon proclaimed young jeharis targaryen to be the true and lawful king of the andals the ruiner and the first men and prince jiharis named lord rogar protector of the realm and hand of the king the prince's mother queen elissa and his sister alisain stood beside him as jiharis unsheathed dark sister and vowed to end the reign of his usurping uncle a hundred banner lords and stormland knights cheered the proclamation prince jaharis was 14 years old when he claimed the throne a handsome youth skilled with lance and longbow and a gifted rider more he wrote a great bronze and tan beast called vermathor and his sister alsane a maid of 12 commanded her own dragon silverwing mego has only one dragon lord vogar told the stormlords a hard prince has two and soon three when word reached the red keep that jaharis was gathering his forces at storm's end reina targaryen mounted dream fire and flew to join him abandoning the uncle that she had been forced to wed she took her daughter aria and blackfire stolen from the king's own scabbard as he slept king maegor's response was sluggish and confused he commanded the grand maester to send forth his ravens summoning all his leel lords and bannermen to gather at king's landing only to find that benefir had taken ships for pentos finding princess arya gone he sent a rider to old town to demand the head of her twin sister raela to punish their mother for her betrayal but lord hightower imprisoned his messenger instead two of his kingsguard vanished one night to go over to jiharis and sir owen bush was found dead outside a brothel his member stuffed into his mouth lord valerion of driftmark was amongst the first to declare for jiharis as the valerions were realms traditional admirals maegor woke to find he had lost the entire royal fleet the tyrells of highgarden followed with all the power of the reach the hightowers of old town the red wines of the arbor the lannisters of casually rock the aarons of the erie the royces of runestone one by one they came out against the king in king's landing a score of lesser lords gathered at maegor's command amongst them lord darkling of duskendale lord massey of stone dance lord towers of harrenhal lord staunton of rook's rest lord bar emmon of sharp point lord buckwell of the antlers the lords rosby stokeworth hayford heart birch rollingford bywater and mallory yet they commanded scarce four thousand men amongst them all and only one in ten of those were knights maegor brought them together in the red keep one night to discuss his plan of battle when they saw how few they were and realized that no great lords were coming to join them many lost heart and lord hayford went so far as to urge his grace to abdicate and take the black his grace ordered hayford beheaded on the spot and continued the war council with his lordship's head mounted on a lance behind the iron throne all day the lords made plans and late into the night it was the hour of the wolf when last maegor allowed them to take their leave the king remained behind brooding on the iron throne as they departed lord towers and lord rosby were the last to see his grace hours later as dawn was breaking the last of maegor's queens came seeking after him queen eleanor found him still upon the iron throne pale and dead his robes soaked with blood his arms had been slashed open from wrist to elbow on jagged barbs and another blade had gone through his neck to emerge beneath his chin many to this day believe it was the iron throne itself that killed him maegor was alive when rosbian towers left the throne room they argue and the guards at the door swore that no one entered afterward until queen eleanor made her discovery some say it was the queen herself who forced him down onto those barbs and blades to avenge the murder of her first husband the kingsguard might have done the deed though that would have required them to act in concert as there were two nights posted at each door it might have also been a person or person's unknown entering and leaving the throne room through some hidden passage the red keep has its secrets known only to the dead it might also be that the king tasted despair in the dark watches of the night and took his own life twisting the blades as needed and opening his veins to spare himself the defeat and disgrace that surely awaited him the reign of king maegor the first targaryen known to history and legend as maegor the cruel lasted six years and 66 days upon his death his corpse was burned in the yard of the red keep his ashes interred afterward on dragonstone beside those of his mother he died childless and left no air of his body you
