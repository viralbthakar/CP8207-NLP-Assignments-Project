 So, my little princess, what is it you want? My birthright-- the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. I fear I'm no better than a servant in this regard. I cannot give you what I do not have. I'm not asking you for the Kingdoms. I'm asking you for ships. I need to cross the Narrow Sea. I need my ships as well. I use them, you see, to bring spices from one port to another. Whatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over when I retake the Iron Throne. Retake? Did you once sit on the Iron Throne? My father sat there before he was murdered. But if you did not sit on it yourself, would it not be correct to say take the Iron Throne? I didn't come here to argue grammar. Of course not. You came to take my ships. So let me explain my position, little princess. Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors. I make my living by trade. And I judge every trade on its merits. You ask for ships. You say I shall be repaid triple. I do not doubt your honesty or your intentions. But before you repay your debts, you must seize the Seven Kingdoms. - Do you have an army? - Not yet. You do not have an army. Do you have powerful allies in Westeros? There are many there that support my claim. When were you there last? I left when I was a baby. So, in truth, you have no allies. The people will rise to fight for their rightful Queen when I return. Ah. Forgive me, little princess, but I cannot make an investment based on wishes and dreams. Now if you'll pardon me. Do you know Illyrio Mopatis, Magister of Pentos? Yes, we've met. A shrewd man. For my wedding he gave me three petrified dragon eggs. He believed-- the world believed-- that the ages had turned them to stone. How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies? But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs into a great fire, they would hatch. When I stepped into the fire, my own people thought I was mad. But when the fire burned out, I was unhurt, the Mother of Dragons. Do you understand? I'm no ordinary woman. My dreams come true. I admire your passion. But in business, I trust in logic, not passion. I'm sorry, little princess. I am not your little princess. I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of old Valyria and I will take what is mine. With fire and blood, I will take it. Yes, My Lady, but not with my ships.
