 well throughout all this we're kind of indirectly indirectly talking about Fire and Blood and there's so much material in this about the targaryens um but could you just introduce introduce the book and and your approach to it it's a it's a history book but there's a lot of different versions of things and you know yes well of course as you know I'm writing and have been writing for many decades now A Song of Ice and Fire which is uh the the series of books that was the basis of Game of Thrones uh and there's still two more books to do and those are you know conventional novels so they're very very ambitious and complex novels because they have multiple Viewpoint characters um interweaving all of the different stories essentially I'm writing you know seven nine twelve novels and interweaving them together but they are conventional novels each chapter has a Viewpoint character and you you see it through that when it became clear that uh we were going to do the dance at a dragon show but that ultimately became House of the Dragon but initially we called it dance with the dragons um we wanted a book to go with that and I already had the seeds of the book from material that was in the world of Ice and Fire and from the novellas I'd written for my friend Gardner does war Princess and the queen and the Rogue Prince and so forth um so I actually asked we're in the the random house Offices here and I'm about to get them in terrible trouble but I asked them well what to do you want me to just ignore the new show that's coming down to Pike or should I finish that book so you can get it out and then go back to and they said yeah give us that the new book that's closer to being done you should have two more books so I I put Winds of Winter aside for a while and I concentrated on finishing Fire and Blood there was a lot of it already there but I had to expand it and polish it and particularly I had to fill in the reign of joharis because if you look at the earlier versions he was reigned for 55 years but he was a good King and so pretty much all I said well he was a good King and they were half a century of peace and prosperity well nobody wants to read that that's boring so I had to uh I had to you know flushrolling it out and write a material under Harris and I did and that came out in uh in in 2018 uh and then I switched immediately back to uh you know when when it's winter right you mentioned 2018 I I read it in 2018 shortly after it came out and it was you know quite an experience um so much history so many names so many births and deaths and um and betrayals and every now and then someone does something nice I guess it was an awful lot of it and I loved it but it was also kind of overwhelming thing is that that really kind of set me up to enjoy watching House of the Dragon um because all this name or some of those names became actual you know people actors who did amazing jobs and you know yeah I love our actors yeah so so for me having read it um ahead of time was kind of a pleasure because every now and then I would go oh I I know that just set up something that's going to happen later on and I was kind of being reminded of it um and I feel like it's yes you could you could like not read Fire and Blood but I think you don't lose anything because you're also there are various versions of a lot of events um in the book but you still don't know what what's what's going to be on the show yes and but I had a lot of fun writing that book um I hope it was fun for the readers too I think it was fun for many of the readers but not all there are people who wanted a conventional model oh sure but um you know if you look at A Song of Ice and Fire the main series that I'm writing um I still have two more books to write and the series is only covering a handful of years the events of a handful of years to cover two and a half centuries I would have had to write 20 novels of you know aegon the Conqueror and his two sons and major the cruel and this revolt and that Revolt um it would have taken me a long time I'm not the fastest writer in the world um so I decided to do it um as a as a fake history you know model to a great degree on what Thomas B costain did with his plantagenist history and then the other thing that got me going was the thought of of history and how history is uh is recorded to us and the thing is we don't you know we think we know history but we don't we don't have time machines we rely on the people who pass it down to us and there are often contradictions um I I that was really brought home to me many decades ago when I was writing uh a novel never published about the yellow journalism in New York City in in the 1890s and it was uh you know it was a great era there were 14 daily newspapers from New York I was writing a story sort of a historical horror novel about three reporters competing for uh for a big story tracking down a killer and one of them was a reporter for the New York world Joseph pulitzer's New York World which was one of the dominant papers of the time and the world was down on newspaper row all of the newspapers were on like the same block but Pulitzer built the tallest building in the world time and he topped it with a golden dome and it stood right next to the sun which was a rival paper and uh the editors didn't like each other so people joked it from his golden dome Pulitzer could spit down on the sun um but the thing is when I'm researching this book and I there was no internet then so I had I had gathered every book I could do about journals in the period and life of Pulitzer and life of everything and I'm researching it a very simple question how many stories was the World building it's the tallest building in the world it's a famous building and I encounter two different versions uh it had 15 stories it had 14 stories and then I try to dig more and there's some 14 to some 50. and then I encounter one of the set of 20 stories say what the hell the building doesn't exist anymore I don't have a time Travel how many stories did it have it's a simple fact and then you go from that and you you look at the history and yeah history is full of wonderful stories I you know I draw a lot in Mabel history but you know Edward II um deposed as king of England by his own son and imprisoned and then murdered supposedly by having a red-hot poker thrust up his ass oh really or did someone invent that story later it's very colorful but the things aren't as probably invented later and then the uh the black dinner Scotland which was one of the sources for the the Red Wedding you know that the King of Scotland invites the Earl of Douglas to Black Douglas and his son his brother who had two teenagers one of them is like 18 one of them is like 16 to a dinner at uh at his castle and they have a lavish dinner and then at the end they bring out a big covered plate silver platter and a gloomy sonorous song begins to do when they lift the they lift a plate and it's a black Boar's Head which is the symbol of death and then they take out the two douglases and murder them um great story very much inspired you know the red wedding or they did it but did it ever happen probably not uh yes the douglasses were certainly killed but was there any was there a song was there but they made it better you know some later thing made it better so that got me all thinking all of this stuff got me thinking about history and saying I'm not just going to do a history I'm going to do a history written a couple hundred years later and you know when you're writing a book I'm sure you you do this with yours work too you know you have an idea for a scene have a different idea for saying oh which one should I go with I'll go with this one I'll go with that one well that one's too wild people never believed I'll go with that you tend to go with the conservative scene but with that kind of thing I could have it both ways I could say this is how septon Eustis said it went and this is how Grandmaster Orwell said it went and this is how mushroom said it went and you pick which one because we don't know yeah or professor gildane doesn't know and we don't know you don't know really the truth about animal or Spartacus in the books you've written about them how much how much of your historical fiction is in fact made up compared to your fantasy it's it's kind of amazing that I can feel very proud um let's say of um Prado Carthage the Hannibal novel and also know know that he probably didn't speak one complete sentence of the dialogue that I I gave him right like it's it's and yet I'm hoping that it still captures the story and speaks to readers but that the inter the way that fantasy and history um intermingle and inform each other I think is is amazing when I was writing that book um I was trying to I was driving around Spain um with my wife and my kids we're camping a lot I was drinking a lot a lot of nice wine and we're taking in um you know ruins and yeah we were doing research but I kept realizing that the place that I needed to write about it wasn't there anymore like I'd go to a room go to a ruin and it was you know it was the Roman ruin but then it was like medieval ruin and it was it was a modern City built on it and everything so it kind of had to to you know lean in to using my imagination and I think that happened happening with with pride of Carthage is probably kind of opened some doors that led me to inevitably toward fantasy um I love historical fiction uh as well as science fiction fantasy and I read a lot of historical fiction but there's a line and I would be very hard-pressed to Define it I mean sometimes I pick up a a novel of historical fiction and there's something in it that I just know is wrong it just jars me right from the beginning and it you know it gets me it puts me right out of it you know I'm reading a Julius Caesar novel and it turns out he has a twin brother well not yet so I don't want to read about that anymore but other things I'll I'll let people get away with um you know frequently I don't know but I mean I love I love one of my great influences um in television is I Claudius which of course is based on the I Claudius BBC series is based on the uh Robert Graves novels I Claudius and Claudius de God which in turn is based on the history of swutonius and Tony has lived hundreds of years after the events he was recording he was just and he was the mushroom of his time and he never nobody ever died in swetonius of natural causes everybody was poisoned or murdered or something like that but it certainly makes her a lively uh read yeah
