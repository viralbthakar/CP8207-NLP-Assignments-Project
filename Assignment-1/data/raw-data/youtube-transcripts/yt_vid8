 the dance of dragons a true telling' by grand mr. Monken being a history of the war of Targaryen succession between the princess rhaenyra and aegon ii of his name that nearly destroyed the realm the dance of the Dragons a stupid name for a Targaryen Civil War where my ancestors danced away my birthright before the war House Targaryen counted 18 dragons by the end we had to and nearly as few Targaryen 's we would never be as powerful or as feared again the dance began as many dancers do with an old man and a young girl the Queen had failed to produce a son for her king so he anointed his daughter the princess rhaenyra as his heir but years later the king remarried and his new wife queen alicent of house Hightower gave him a son feeble and foolish the old king refused to change the succession he didn't even see how is called had split into two rival camps of blacks and greens after the dresses of the princess and the Queen had worn to some Tony one night a servant found the old king had died in his sleep and ran to inform queen alicent protocol dictated that the bells would be rung and a raven sent to Dragonstone to some in the air princess rhaenyra for her coronation but allison had other plans once she saw her dead husband's body she sealed the room and had a servant thrown into the black cells to ensure his silence at the hour of the owl the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard so Kristen Cole summoned the small council to inform them of the King's death so Otto Hightower the hand of the king and father to queen alicent demanded that the succession be settled immediately the decrepit old men of the small council were confused the succession was settled in their minds the old king had forced the lords of westeros to swear fealty to princess rhaenyra as his heir but Sir Kristen Cole rightly pointed out that her son comes before a daughter the council argued until dawn when the master of coin finally stood up and declared he would have no part of treason so Kristen Cole wisely opened his throat with a dagger ending the debate none were more surprised to hear of Prince Aegon succession than Prince Aegon himself at first the fool rejected the crown but his mother pointed out that his sister rhaenyra would return such loyalty by taking his head as the old King's trueborn son he'd always be a threat eggwin relented he was crowned in the dragon pit and his wife and sister helena became queen his brother Amon flew off to win over the few great Lords who support Aegon didn't already have the banner of the gold dragon flew over King's Landing in the red key as Aegon second of his name ascended the iron throne he would not sit at long when Ravens carried the news of a Gunn's coronation to dragonstone princess rhaenyra summoned her own black council with her was her uncle and husband daemon targaryen considered by many to be the most dangerous man in Westeros few Lords supported her but the greatest of these was Corliss valerian who controlled the largest fleet in the rail and his Targaryen wife Rhaenys the old king sister then there were her five sons although none grown to manhood a pitiful assembly really combined they couldn't match the power of house Hightower alone but rhaenyra had dragons she Damon and Rhaenys rode huge and formidable beasts and three of her five sons were riders as well Dragonstone also held six more dragons without riders against this King Aegon had only four dragons of his own dragons can burn a city but only armies can take and hold it if she was to prevail rhaenyra desperately needed the support of the few Great Houses not already swarmed to Aegon her eldest son Jake Eris flew to the Vale in the north her middle son Luke Aerys flew to the Stormlands rhaenyra hoped that the war would begin and if the gods were good end with diplomacy as always they weren't little prince Luke Aerys must have wet himself when he entered storm's end and found king aegon's younger brother Aymond already with Lord Baratheon Amon was fearsome even before he lost his eye and set a sapphire in his stead but the princeling pleaded his mother's case finally Lord Baratheon made his decision go on pop and tell the [ __ ] Your Mother that the Lord of storms end is not a dog she can whistle up as a man's false eye at him the princeling fled the casstle and mounted his young dragon clerics the rain fell in sheets and great bolts of lightning lit the world brightest day Erick's were struggling to stay aloft in the gale when a roll shook the very foundations of storms end Amon rose through the clouds and below him the monstrous Vega Veigar was five times the size of Eric's and the hardened survivor of a hundred battles veigar caught him above shipbreaker bay Watchers on the castle walls saw distant blasts of flame and heard a shriek drown out the Thunder prinsloo caressed fell broken to be swallowed by the waves with his death the war Ravens came to an end and the war of fire and blood began when rhaenyra heard of her son's death she collapsed she considered ending the war right then until a raven arrived from her husband daemon her son would be avenged whispers slithered through the taverns and back alleys of flea bottom two men were found one was a former gold cloak the other a ratcatcher in the red keep who knew all its secrets history remembers them only as blood and cheese one night queen helaena entered the royal apartments with her daughter and two sons to put them to bed without warning blood and cheese bursting daggers in hand they told her that a debt was owed a son for a son blood and cheese demanded she choose which son would be ripped from her forever queen helaena pleaded with the man to kill her instead but they refused weeping Hellena named her younger son Melo perhaps she thought the boy was too young to understand perhaps because the older boy was king aegon's firstborn son and heir you hear that little boy she's whispered to the younger son your mama wants you dead then blood struck off the older boy's head with a single blow when the guards burst in they found queen helaena still screaming clasping her dead son's body to her mad with grief the blood of their children transformed a dynastic dispute into a war of annihilation the grief and rage of losing a child could burn down the world either egg on or aneri could live at the end but not both rhaenyra's forces struck yet another blow the moment the lord of harrenhal saw daemon targaryen circling the castle on his dragon caraxes he struck his banners and surrendered the blanks now had the strongest castle in the Riverlands darker news still came to Aegon thanks to rhaenyra's son's Winterfell had declared for rhaenyra as had the veil furious Aegon dismissed his grandfather sir otto his hand and appointed so Kristen Cole who swore to march on all the lords were declared for rhaenyra and put their castles to the torch coal and the royal army first marched north and laid siege to rooks rest a black stronghold near Dragonstone when the Lord saw their approach he sent a raven to rhaenyra begging for help for days he watched his fields and villages burning with no response from his queen until one day a shadow passed over the green army rhaenyra had sent not an army but her former mother by law reigns and her dragon Malins as her ancestor had done field of fire Rhaenys gleefully began to incinerate sacristans army with a gone and set a trap a trainees had flown right into it as Rainey's and Malee's blanketed sacristans troops and dragon flame to other dragons rose into the sky Amon Don Vega and King Aegon himself on the gleaming Sun fire to her credit Rainey didn't flee dragon fought dragons and his second son blossomed in the sky when the smoke cleared only Aymond and veigar stood uninjured son fire the most magnificent dragon in the world had one of its wings almost completely torn from its body trapped beneath Sun fire was the king himself broken and burned so badly in places that his armor had fused onto his flesh his body survived but his mind was given over to milk of the poppy Malee's had been torn to shreds and her rider Rainey's was a pile of ash panicked by the defeat Rainier has shipped her two youngest sons across the Narrow Sea for their protection only fair youngest to return days later clinging to the neck of his wounded and dying dragon he and his brother had been set upon by an enemy fleet just off dragon stone defying his mother's command rhaenyra's eldest son and heir Jake Harris mounted his dragon vormax and flew to rescue his other brother and punish the enemy fleet but the foolish boy let vormax be hooked like a trout and dragged into the sea where he soaked up even more arrows and sea water his brother disappeared over the horizon or beneath the waves no one could say for sure with the loss of four dragons Ramirez only advantage was fading luckily for her over the centuries House Targaryen had spilled more than blood on Dragonstone she promised gold and title to any of the Targaryen bastards who could tame the six unclaimed dragons on the island these bastards were called the dragon seeds though most were called supper then perhaps the Dragons were eventually sated or bored but four of them accepted riders and were enlisted in rhaenyra's cause after rooks rest a man wanna I took command of the greens from his crippled and poppy addled brother Amon was the blood of the dragon and dragons don't cower behind city walls he marched the king's army north to take back Harrenhal from rhaenyra's husband daemon but when he and Kristen Cole reached the castle they found the gates open with daemon and all his men gone that night they feasted their victory Damon had fled rather than faced their wrath the daemon was more snake than dragon as a man marched north he'd flown carracks east south slithering past the green army over the waters of the gods eye on day King's Landing looked up and saw two dragons circling their foul City Damon and rhaenyra had come for for the city was defenseless Ament had taken the king's army from the city and worse he taken his dragon Vega seeing the resistance was hopeless the small council surrendered the city the Queen Mother alicent and the broken queen helaena but not King Aegon somehow despite his wounds and delirium he had vanished from the city and so queen rhaenyra climbed the steps and seated herself on the Iron Throne legend has it that as she left the hall later blood trickled down her legs and hens proving the Iron Throne had spurned her nonsens it's a chair made of steel blades rhaenyra had wanted it all her life and it's sacrificed two suns for it she likely gripped the damn thing too tight when Aymond realized that his arrogance had cost him the capital he mounted veigar in a black rage and rained fire onto every village and castle he suspected of disloyalty abandoned by Aymond to christen marched the royal army back to King's Landing intent on recapturing the city himself instead he was trapped and cut to pieces by the river Lords who had sworn to support rhaenyra's claim when a new army of green loyalists marked up from the reach and laid siege to the city of tumble ttan rhaenyra sent two of her dragon seeds to lay waste to them instead the dragon seed proved their bastard nature and betrayed her they burned the city and all the black forces garrisoned within lucky for her they didn't turn towards King's Landing but horde and drank in the ruins with the greens who were victorious and somewhat confused Rainie are now mistrusted all the dragon seeds including the girl who rode with her husband daemon hunting Aymond in the Riverlands she ordered the girl's head be sent to her but there was a complication as well as her dragon the girl had taken to writing daemon when Damon received the Queen's order he proclaimed at a Queen's words and a horse work he sent the girl away at dawn watching her and her dragon vanish into the morning mists then Damon sent the challenge to his nephew Aymond and flew to Harrenhal alone to wait 14 days later the shadow blacker than any passing clouds swept over Harrenhal Veigar had come at last and on her back road one eye prince aemond he mocked the demon for facing him alone you have lived too long uncle and Damon replied on that much we agree then the old prince climbed stiffly onto the back of his dragon caraxes but neglected to fasten the chains that secured rider to son the son was close to setting when as one the two dragons left into the sky Damon took our axes up swiftly until they disappeared into a bank of clouds Veigar older and slow ascended more gradual up-and-up Veigar sword searching for currencies sudden as a thunderbolt a shrieking crack seized over bond Vegard locked together the dragon stumbled toward the lake corrects his jaws closed about vague arsenic but Vega raked open cracks his belly and her teeth ripped off a wing lay crushed up with terrible speed then daemon targaryen court never fastened his writing chains stood in his saddle he left from his dragon to Amin's and in his hand was dark sister the Valyrian sword of a cons sister queen Visenya as amon one i looked up in terror daemon ripped off his nephews helm and drove the sword down into his one remaining eye so hard the point came out the back of the young prince's throat half a heartbeat later the Dragons struck the lake sending up a gout of water so high that it was said to have been as tall as Haran halls great tower the lake boiled with dragon blood and then was still daemon targaryen was 9 and 40 at his death prince aemond had only turned 20 Veigar the greatest of the Targaryen dragons had counted 181 years thus past the last living creature from the days of Aegon's conquest back in King's Landing queen rhaenyra didn't have much time to grieve for her stupid husband the mad former queen helaena flung herself from a balcony to be impaled upon the iron spikes lining the moat of mega was hold fast that night the city rose in riot against rhaenyra demanding justice for queen helaena and her murdered son among other foolish peasant fantasies in the midst of this chaos a one-handed fool called the Shepherd began to rant against dragons not just the ones of the enemy but all dragons everywhere as he pointed to the dragon pit above on the hill he shouted there the demons dwell this is their city if you would make it yours first you must destroy them cry went up from 10,000 throats kill them there were four dragons housed within the dragon pit that night by the time the first of the attackers came pouring in all four were roused awake and angry nobody knows how many men and women died that night who cares they all should have trapped within the pit the Dragons could not fly instead they formed with horns claws teeth and fire for every man who died ten war appeared shouting that the Dragons must die one by one they did finally the last remaining dragon broke her chains spread her wings and flew straight up at the Great Dome trying to flee already weakened by dragon flame the dome cracked under the force of impact and then tumbled down crushing dragon slayers and herself high atop the red keep queen rhaenyra clutched her two remaining sons to her as she watched the end of a family's might too afraid of the peasants to defend her dragons at least her older son Joffrey had a man's spine he stole his mother's dragons Cyrax and tried to fly it to the dragon pit to save his birthright the stupid beasts didn't understand and twist it beneath him fighting to be free of the little boy until it was a queen is still a woman with all the weakness of that sexes weeping for her lost son more than her dragons rhaenyra abandoned the iron throne and sold her crown to buy passage for her and her last son back to Dragonstone rhaenyra hoped to hatch more dragons from the eggs in the castle but when she landed the welcoming party slew her guards and marched her and her son at spear point to the castle to face a dead man and a dying dragon sister King Aegon second of his name called out to reign era rooks rest had left Aegon bent and twisted his once handsome face puffy from milk of the poppy with burn scars covering half his body rhaenyra ever defiant told her dear brother that she'd hoped he was dead after you Aegon answered then Sunfire bathe her in a blast of flame and devoured her in six bites or the son watched leading the seventh and final bite her lower leg for the stranger rhaenyra was dead and king aegon sat the iron throne again but only for half a year he was poisoned by his own men and replaced with the very boy who had watched his mother devoured when Rheneas lasts unwed Agron's only daughter the dance of dragons officially ended passion burned men all that was left of the revelant - scared children spouting oaths they didn't understand all that was left of the mighty House Targaryen ancient skulls and hatch things that grew no bigger than cats all was left of the Dragons
