 one of the things that's so fun about this book is the that there are dragons and I mean one of these amazing things about the Song of Ice and Fire is that you're entering a fantasy world in which fantasy has receded to a large degree magic and Dragons and everything is in the background such that most of the characters kind of think maybe it didn't happen and then spoilers that magic and the Dragons start to reassert in the world but you're really waiting for a long time for them to do their stuff in this book there's dragon fire right at the top and they're burning up armies like crazy and I say I wonder how much you thought about what it would be what it was like in a very you know the the I've often thought that what makes your book so interesting as fantasy books is that you would never actually fantasize about living in that world because it's so brutal and so rooted in the brutality of medieval life including very realistic depictions of hand-to-hand warfare and and horse warfare but now you have an air force in this world do you have to rethink what warfare would be like well I'd yeah I'd certainly to some extent I still made dragons relatively rare even in fire and blood where at one point there there are I think 17 living dragons in Westeros I don't have hundreds or thousands of dragons which would dramatically change the very nature of life any I mean I think fantasy must contain magic magic sorcery whatever you want to call it but it has to be handled very very carefully I mean it's like salt in a stew you know or add a little salt and mix your stew or whatever it tastes better you had too much salt and that's all you can taste is the salt then it overwhelms yes thanks so magic is it's the hardest thing to write in some ways the Dragons and and the other things the spells I try to handle those very carefully and dance around them even with a character like Melisandre you know is she really doing magic where she bluffing in some senses or what's going on I try to give a little subtlety and ambiguity there I think there's a lot of fantasy out there that over does the magic and they don't really think about the effect of magic would have on a society as a whole because if you really do have wizards who can wipe out an entire army of a hundred thousand people by reciting a spell and waving your wand why would that world even why would the Lords assemble an army of a hundred thousand people it seems stupid if one wizard can just go boogity boogity boo and everybody is dead so you know you have to you have to be pretty pretty careful about these things and even the way that you deal with magic in the books the the it is almost as a medieval quality because the magic is often very blunt and brutal Melisandre's magic is bloody and weird and and and kind of very constrained and one of the things I love about this book is again the dragons are magical creatures but they're very physical creatures they live a long time but as you point out they're very there are very few of them and they're for the Targaryens they're a very precious resource that they almost tragically take for granted at a certain point in the book and I won't say any more about that well you can you find all about them if you if you read the read the book so I did have to track the dragons too you know and then name them all and say whoa Kay who wrote this trick and then who wrote him next in what years this you know cuz my my readers I mean if you think I'm crazy obsessive about this stuff I have readers out there who will write me letters at the drop of a hat and you know even in the original novels I have you know I have a horse that changes sex between the first book and the second book hundreds of people have picked up on that although I I'm terrible remembering people's eye color you know people have blue eyes and one and green eyes in the next book and then in the third book I said he had blue green eyes that seemed to change color according to the light I thought that was a graceful save so it's all it's a little a little tricky here it's the same thing about I mean that I've had people say well the real Middle Ages had no magic in my books at magic which is only partially true because who actually went back in a time machine to the Middle Ages and you asked the people who were living then they thought they had magic - they believed in all this stuff they thought there were dragons they just didn't happen to be in their County but the next County had dragons and and there were certainly sorcerers let's not talk about the next county there there were witches and you know they they would crush them with stones or burn them or get rid of them they obviously thought they were real so people the Middle Ages believed in magic they thought it was pretty pretty real [Music]
