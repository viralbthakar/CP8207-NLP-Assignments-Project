 fire and blood chapter 15 the dying of the dragons the red dragon and the gold the dance of the dragons entered a new stage after the death of lucerus valerion in the stormlands and the murder of prince jaehaerus before his mother's eyes in the red keep for both the blacks and the greens blood called to blood for vengeance and all across the realm lords called their batters and armies gathered and began to march in the riverlands raiders out of raventree flying right near his banners crossed into the lands of house bracken burning crops driving off sheep and cattle sacking villages and despoiling every sap they came on the blackwoods were one of the last houses south of the neck who still followed the old gods when the brackens gathered a strong force to strike back lord samwell blackwood surprised them on the march taking them unawares as they camped beneath the riverside mill in the fight that followed the mill was put to the torch and men fought and died for hours bathed in the red light of the flames sir amos bracken leading the host from stonehenge cut down and slew lord blackwood in single combat only to perish himself when a weirwood arrow found the eye slit of his helm and drove deep into his skull supposedly that shaft was loosed by lord samwell's 16 year old sister alisain who would later be known as black alley but whether this is fact or mere family legend cannot be known many other grievous losses were suffered by both sides and what became known as the battle of the burning mill and when the brackens finally broke and fled back onto their own lands under the command of sir amos's bastard half brother sir raylan rivers it was only to find that stonehedge had been taken in their absence led by prince damon on caraxies a strong host made up of daris roots pipers and freys had captured the castle by storm in absence of so much of house bracken strength lord humphrey bracken and his remaining children had been made captive along with his third wife and baseborne paramour rather than see them come to harm sir rayland yielded with house bracken thus broken and defeated the last of king aegon's supporters in the riverlands lost heart and laid down their own swords as well yet it must not be thought that the green council was sitting idle sir otto hightower had been busy as well winning over lords hiring sellswords strengthening the defenses of king's landing and assiduously seeking after other alliances after the rejection of grand maester orwell's peace overtures the hand redoubled his efforts dispatching ravens to winterfell in the erie to riverrun white harbor goldtown bitter bridge fair isle and half a hundred other keeps and castles riders gallop through the night to holdings closer to hand to summon their lords and ladies to court to do fealty to king again sir otto reached out to dorne whose ruling prince coryn martell had once warned against prince damon in the stepstones but prince corinth spurned his offer the thorn has danced with dragons before he said i would sooner sleep with scorpions yet sir otto was losing the trust of his king who mistook his efforts for inaction and his caution for cowardice septon eustis tells us of one occasion where agent entered the tower of the hand and found sir otto writing another letter whereupon he knocked the inkpot in his grand sire's lap declaring thrones are one with swords not quills spill blood not ink the fall of harrenhal to prince damon came as a great shock to his grace monken tells us until that moment again ii had believed his half-sister's cause to be hopeless harrenhal left his grace feeling vulnerable for the first time the subsequent defeats at the burning mill in stonehenge came as further blows and made the king realize that his situation was more perilous than it had seemed these fears deepened as ravens returned from the reach where the greens had believed themselves strongest house hightower in old town were solidly behind king again and his grace had the arbor too but elsewhere in the south other lords were declaring for rhaenyra amongst them lord costain of three towers lord mullendore of uplands lord tarly of horn hill lord rowan of golden grove and lord grimm of greyshield loudest amongst these traitors was sir alan beesberry lord lymon's heir who was demanding the release of his grandsire from the dungeon where most believe the former master of coin to be confined faced with such a clamor from their own bannermen the castilian steward and mother of the young lord tyrell of highgarden acting as regions for the boy suddenly thought better of their support for king again and decided house tyrell would take no part in this struggle king aegon began to drown his fears and strong wine septeneus tells us sir otto sent word to his nephew lord ormond hightower beseeching him to use the power of old town to put down the rash of rebellions in the reach other blows followed the vale white harbour winterfell the blackwoods and the other riverlords streamed toward harrenhal and prince damon's banners the sea snake's fleets closed blackwater bay and every morning king aegon had merchants whining at him his grace had no answer for the complaints beyond another cup of strong wine do something he demanded of sir otto the hand assured him that something was being done he had hatched a plan to break the valerian blockade one of the chief pillars of support for rhaenyra's claim was a consort yet prince damon represented one of her greatest weaknesses as well the prince had made more foes than friends during the course of his adventures sir otto hightower who had been amongst the first of these foes reached across the narrow sea to another of the prince's enemies the kingdom of the three daughters by itself the royal fleet lacked the strength to break the sea snake's chokehold on the gullet and king aegon's overtures to dalton greyjoy of pyke had thus far failed to win the iron islands to a side the combined fleets of tyrosh lis and mir would be more than a match for the valerions however sir otto sent word to the magisters promising exclusive trading rights at king's landing if they would clear the gullet of the sea snake ships and open the sea lanes once again to add savor to the stew he also promised to cede the stepstones to the three daughters though in truth the iron throne had never cleaned those aisles the triarchy was never quick to move however lacking a true king all important decisions in this three-headed kingdom were decided by the high council eleven magisters from each city made up its membership and every man of them intent on demonstrating his own sagacity shrewdness and importance and winning every possible advantage for his own city grand mr graydon who wrote the definitive history of the kingdom of the three daughters 50 years later described it as 33 horses each pulling in his own direction even issues as timely as war peace and alliance were subject to endless debate and the high council was not even in session when sir otto's envoys arrived the delay did not sit well with the young king aegin ii had run short of patience with his grandfather's prevarications though his mother the dourger queen alicent spoke up in serato's defense his grace turned a deaf ear to her pleading summoning sir otto to the throne room he tore the chain of office from his neck and tossed it to sir christian cole my new hand is a steel fist he boasted we are done with writing letters sir christian wasted no time improving his medal it is not for you to plead for support from your lords like a beggar pleading for alms he told aegin you are the lawful king of westeros and those who deny it are traitors it is time they learn the price of treason first to pay that price were the captive lords languishing in the dungeons under the red keep men who had once sworn to defend the rights of princess rhaenyra and still stubbornly refused to bend the knee to king again one by one they were dragged out into the castle ward where the king's justice awaited them with his axe each man was given one final chance to swear fealty to his grace only lord butterwell lord stokeworth and lord rosby chose to do so lord hayford lord meriwether lord hart lord buckler lord caswell and lady fell valued their sworn word more than their lives and were beheaded each in turn along with eight landed knights and two score servants and retainers their heads were mounted on spikes above the city's gates king agen also desired to avenge the murder of his heir by blood and cheese by means of an attack on dragonstone descending on the island's citadel on dragonback to seize or slay his half-sister and her bastard it took all of the green council to dissuade him so christian cole urged a different course the pretender princess had made use of stealth and treachery to kill prince jiharis cole said let them do the same we will pay the princess back in her own bloody coin he told the king the instrument the lord commander of the kingsguard chose for the king's vengeance was his sworn brother sir eric cargill sir eric was intimately familiar with the ancient seed of house targaryen having visited there often during the reign of king viserys many fishermen still plied the waters of blackwater bay for dragonstone depended on the sea for sustenance it would be a simple thing to deliver cargill to the fishing village under the castle from there he could make his own way to the queen and sir eric and his brother sir eric were twins identical in all respects not even their fellows the kingsguard could tell the two apart both mushroom in septon eustis assert once clad in white sir eric should be able to move freely about dragonstone so christian suggested any guards who chanced to encounter him would surely mistake him for his brother sir eric did not undertake this mission happily indeed septon eustis tells us the troubled knight visited the red keep sept on the night he was to sail to pray for forgiveness to our mother above yet as kingsguard sworn to obey king and commander he had no choice in honor but to make his way to dragonstone clad in the salt stained garb of a simple fisherman the true purpose of sir eric's mission remains a matter of some contention grand maester munken tells us that cardinal had been commanded to slay rhaenyra putting an end to her rebellion at a stroke whilst mushroom insists that her sons were karjal's prey that aegin ii wished to wash out the blood of his murdered son with that of his bastard nephews jacaris and joffrey strong sir eric came ashore without hindrance donned his armor and white cloak and had no trouble gaining entrance to the castle in the guise of his twin brother just as sir christian cole had planned deep in the heart of dragonstone however as he was making his way to the royal apartments the gods brought him face to face with sir eric himself who knew at once what his brother's presence meant the singers tell us that sir eric said i love you brother as he unsheathed his blade and that sir eric replied and i love you brother as he drew his own the twins battled for the best part of an hour grand maester munken says the clash of steel on steel woke half the queen's court but the onlookers could only stand by helplessly and watch for no man there could tell which brother was which in the end sir eric and sir eric dealt each other mortal wounds and died in one another's arms with tears upon their cheeks mushrooms account is shorter saltier and altogether nastier the fight lasted only moments our fool says there were no declarations of brotherly love each cardinal denounced the other as a traitor as they clashed sir eric standing above his twin on the spiral steps struck the first mortal blow a savage downward cut that nye took his brother's sword arm off his shoulder but as he collapsed her arrow grasped his slayer's white cloak and pulled him close enough to drive a dagger deep into his belly sir eric was dead before the first guards arrived but sir eric took four days to die of his gut wound screaming in horrible pain and cursing his traitor brother all the while for obvious reasons singers and storytellers have shown a marked preference for the tale as told by monken maesters and other scholars must make their own determination as to which version is more likely all that septon eustace says upon the matter is that the cardinal twins slew each other and there we must leave it back in king's landing king aegon's master of whispers larry strong the clubfoot had drawn up a list of all those lords who had gathered on dragonstone to attend queen rainier's coronation and sit on her black council lords keltigar and valerion had their seats on islands as aegon ii had no strength at sea they were beyond the reach of his wrath those black lords whose lands were on the mainland enjoyed no such protection however with a hundred nights and 500 minute arms of the royal household augmented by three times as many hard and sell swords sir christian marched on rosby and stokeworth whose lords had only recently repented of their allegiance to the queen commanding them to prove their loyalty by adding their power to his own thus augmented cole's hosts advanced upon the walled harbor town of duskendale where they took the defenders by surprise the town was sacked the ships in the harbor set a fire lord darklin beheaded his household knights and garrison were given the choice between swearing their swords to king again or sharing the lord's fate most chose the former rook's rest was sir christian's next objective forewarned of their coming lord staunton closes gates and defied the attackers behind his walls his lordship could only watch as his fields and woods and villages were burned his sheep and cattle and small folk put to the sword when provisions inside the castle began to run low he dispatched a raven to dragonstone pleading for sucker the bird arrived as rhaenyra and her blacks were mourning sir eric and debating the proper response to egg in the usurper's latest attack though shaken by this attempt on her life or the lives of her sons the queen was still reluctant to attack king's landing munken who it must be remembered wrote many years later says this was because of her horror of kinslane maker the cruel had slain his own nephew again and had been cursed thereafter until he bled his life away upon his stolen throne septon eustis claims rhaenyra had a mother's heart that made her reluctant to risk the lives of her remaining sons mushroom alone was present for these councils however and the fool insists that rhaenyra was still so grief-sick over the death of her son lucaris that she absented herself from the war council giving over her command to the sea snake and his wife princess rhaenys here mushroom's version seems most likely for we know that nine days after lord staunton dispatched his plea for help the sound of leather and wings was heard across the sea and the dragon melees appeared above rook's rest the red queen she was called for the scarlet scales that covered her the membranes of her wings were pink her chest horns and claws bright as copper and on her back in steel and copper armor that flashed in the sun rode rainey's targaryen the queen who never was sir christian cole was not dismayed against han had expected this counted on it drums beat out a command and archers rush forward longbowmen and crossbowmen both filling the air with arrows and quarrels scorpions were cranked upward to loose iron bolts of the sort that had once felled meraxis and dorne maylie suffered a score of hits but the arrows only served to make her angry she swept down spitting fire to the right and left knights burned in their saddles as hair and hide and harness of their horses went up in flames men at arms dropped their spears and scattered some tried to hide behind their shields but neither oak nor iron could withstand dragon's breath so christian sat on his white horse shouting aim for the rider through the smoke and flame melee's roared smoke swirling from her nostrils a stallion kicking in her jaws as tongues of fire engulfed him then came an answering roar two more winged shapes appeared the king of strides sunfire the golden and his brother aymond upon vegar christian cole had sprung his trap and rhaenys had come snatching at the bait now the teeth closed around her princess rhaenys made no attempt to flee with a glad cry in a crack of her whip she turned melees toward the foe against veigar alone she might have had some chance but against vegar and sunfire together doom was certain the dragons met violently a thousand feet above the field of battle as balls of fire burst and blossomed so bright that men swore later that the sky was full of suns the crimson jaws of melees closed round sunfire's golden neck for a moment till vegar fell upon them from above all three beasts went spinning toward the ground they struck the ground so hard that stones fell from the battlements of rook's rest half a leak away those closest to the dragons did not live to tell the tale those farther off could not see the flame in smoke it was hours before the fires guttered out but from those ashes only vegard rose unharmed melees was dead broken by the fall and ripped to pieces upon the ground and sunfire that splendid golden beast had one wing half torn from his body whilst his royal rider had suffered broken ribs a broken hip and burns that covered half his body his left arm was the worst the dragon flame had burned so hot that the king's armor had melted into his flesh a body believed to be rhaenys targaryen was later found beside the carcass of her dragon but it was so blackened that no one could be sure it was her beloved daughter of lady jocelyn baratheon and prince aemon targaryen faithful wife to lord corliss velaryon mother and grandmother the queen who never was lived fearlessly and died amidst blood and fire she was 55 years old 800 knights and squires and common men lost their lives that day as well another hundred perished not long after when prince aymond and sir christian cole took rook's rest and put its garrison to death lord stonton's head was carried back to king's landing and mounted above the old gate but it was the head of the dragon melees drawn through the city on a cart that awed the crowds of small folk into silence septon eustis tells us that thousands left king's landing afterward until the daughter queen alicent ordered the city gates closed and barred king aegon ii did not die though his burns brought him such pain that some say he prayed for death carried back to king's landing in a closed litter to hide the extent of his injuries his grace did not rise from his bed for the rest of the year septons prayed for him maesters attended him with potions and milk of the poppy but aegin slept 9 hours out of every 10 waking only long enough to take some meager nourishment before he slept again none was allowed to disturb his rest save his mother the dowrigger queen in his hand sir christian cole his wife never as much made the attempt so lost was helena in her own grief and madness the king's dragon sunfire too huge and heavy to be missed and unable to fly with his injured wing remained in the fields beyond rook's rest crawling through the ashes like some great golden worm in the early days he fed himself upon the burned carcasses of the slain when those were gone the men sir christian had left behind to guard him brought him calves and sheep you must rule the realm now until your brother is strong enough to take the crown again the king's hand told prince aemond nor did sir christian need to say it twice writes eustace and so one-eyed aemon the kinslayer took upon the iron and ruby crown of egg and the conqueror it looks better on me than it ever did on him the prince proclaimed yet eamon did not assume the style of king but named himself only protector of the realm and prince regent so christian cole remained hand of the king meanwhile the seeds jacaris valerion had planted on his flight north had begun to bear fruit and men were gathering at white harbor winterfell baroton sisterton gull town and the gates of the moon should they join their strength to that of the riverlords assembling at harrenhal with prince damon even the strong walls of king's landing might not be able to withstand them so christian warned the new prince regent the tidings from the south were ominous as well obedient to his uncle's entradies lord ormond hightower had issued fourth from old town with a thousand knights a thousand archers three thousand men at arms and uncounted thousands of camp followers sell swords free riders and rabble only to find himself set upon by sir alan beesberry and lord alan tarly though commanding far fewer men the two allens harassed him day and night raiding his camps murdering his scouts setting fires in his line of march farther south lord costine had issued forth from three towers to fall upon hightower's baggage train worse reports had reached his lordship that a host equal in size to his own was descending on the mander led by thaddeus rowan lord of golden grove lord ormond had therefore decided he cannot proceed without support from king's landing we have need of y'all dragons he wrote supremely confident in his own prowess as a warrior and the might of his dragon veigar eamonn was eager to take the battle to the foe the on dragonstone is not the threat he said no more than rowan and these traitors in the reach the danger is my uncle once damon is dead all these fools flying our sister's banners will run back to their castles and trouble us no more east of blackwater bay queen rhaenyra was also faring badly the death of her son lucaris had been a crushing blow to a woman already broken by pregnancy labor and stillbirth when word reached dragonstone that princess rhaenys had fallen angry words were exchanged between the queen and lord velaryon who blamed her for his wife's death it should have been you the sea snake shouted at her grace staunton sent to you yet you left it to my wife to answer and forbade your sons to join her for all the castle knew the princes jace and jav had been eager to fly with prince rhaenys to rook's rest with her own dragon only i could lighten her grace's heart mushroom claims in his testimony in this dark hour i became the queen's counselor setting aside my full scepter and pointed hat to lent her all my wisdom in compassion unbeknownst to all it was the jester who ruled them now an invisible king in motley these are large claims for a small man and one's not born out by any of our other chroniclers no more than by the facts her grace was far from alone four living sons remained to her my strength and my consolation the queen called them egan the younger and viserys prince daemon's sons were nine and seven respectively prince joffrey was 11 but jacaris prince of dragonstone was on the cusp of his 15th name day it was jace who came to the fore now late in the year 129 ac mindful of the promise he had made the maiden of the vale he ordered prince joffrey to fly to goldtown with tyraxes munken suggests that jace's desire to keep his brother far from the fighting was paramount in this decision this did not sit well with joffrey who is determined to prove himself in battle only when told that he was being sent to defend the veil against king against dragons did his brother grudgingly consent to go reyna the 13 year old daughter of prince damon by lena velaryon was chosen to accompany him known as reyna of pentos for the city of her birth she was no dragon rider her hatchling having died some years before but she brought three dragons eggs with her to the veil where she prayed nightly for their hatching lady rina's twin bayla remained on dragonstone long betrothed to prince chicaris she refused to leave him insisting that she would fight beside him on her own dragon though moondancer was too small to bear her weight though bayla had announced her intent to marry jace at once no wedding was ever held munken says the prince did not wish to wed until the war was over whilst mushroom claims jacaris was already married to sarah snow the mysterious bastard girl from winterfell the prince of dragonstone also had a care for the safety of his half-brothers egg and the younger in viserys aged nine and seven their father prince damon had made many friends in the free city of pentos during his visits there so jacaris reached out across the narrow sea to the prince of that city who agreed to foster the two boys until rhaenyra had secured the iron throne in the waning days of 129 ac the young princess boarded the cog gay abandon aegon with stormcloud viserys clutching his egg to set sail for essos the sea snake sent seven of his warships with them as escort to see that they reach pentos safely prince jakaris soon brought the lord of tides back into the fold by naming him the hand of the queen together he and lord corliss began to plan an assault upon king's landing with sunfire wounded near rook's rest and unable to fly and tessarion with prince darren in old town only two mature dragons had remained to defend king's landing and dreamfire's rider queen helena spent her days in darkness weeping and surely could not be counted as a threat that left only vegar no living dragon could match veigar for size or ferocity but jace reasoned that if vermax cerex and caraxies were to descend on king's landing even that hory would be unable to withstand them mushroom was less certain three is more than one the dwarf claims to have told the prince of dragonstone but four is more than three and six is more than four even a fool knows that when jace pointed out that stormcloud had never been ridden that moondancer was but a hatchling that tyraxis was far away in the veil with prince joffrey and demanded to know where mushroom proposed to find more dragons the dwarf tells us he laughed and said under the sheets and in the wood piles wherever you targaryen spilled your silver seed house targaryen had ruled dragonstone for more than 200 years since lord aynar targaryen first arrived from valyria with his dragons though it had always been their costume to wed brother to sister and cousin to cousin youngblood runs hot and it was not unknown for the men of the house to seek their pleasures amongst the daughters and even the wives of their subjects the small folk who lived in the villages below the dragon mont tillers of the land and fishers of the sea indeed until the reign of king jiharis the ancient rite of the first night had been invoked mayhaps more often dragonstone than anywhere else in the seven kingdoms though good queen alisain would surely have been shocked to hear it though the first night was greatly resented elsewhere as queen allison had learned in her women's councils such feelings were muted upon dragonstone where targaryens were rightly regarded as being closer to the gods than the common run of men here brides thus blessed upon their wedding nights were envied and the children born of such unions were esteemed above all others for the lords of dragonstone oft celebrated the birth of such with lavish gifts of gold and silk and land to the mother these happy bastards were said to have been born of dragon seed and in time became known simply as seeds even after the end of the rite of the first night certain targaryens continued to dally with the daughters of innkeeps and the wives of fishermen so seeds and the sons of seeds were plentiful on dragonstone it was to them prince jacares turned at the urging of his fool vowing that any man who could master a dragon would be granted lands and riches and dubbed a knight his sons would be ennobled his daughters wed to lords and he himself would have the honor of fighting beside the prince of dragonstone against the pretender aegin ii targaryen and his treasonous supporters not all those who came forward in answer to the prince's call were seeds nor even the sons or grandsons of seeds a score of the queen's own household knights offered themselves as dragon riders amongst them the lord commander of her queen's guard sir stefan darklin along with squires scullions sailors men at arms mummers and two maids the sowing of the seeds monken names the triumphs and tragedies that ensued crediting the notion to jakirus himself not mushroom others prefer the red sewing the most unlikely of these would-be dragon riders was mushroom himself whose testimony speaks at length of his attempt to mount old silver wing judged to be the most docile of the masterless dragons one of the dwarfs more amusing tales it ends with mushroom running across the ward of dragonstone with the seat of his pantaloons on fire and nigh drowning when he leapt into a well to quench the flames unlikely to be sure but it does provide a drawl moment in what was otherwise a ghastly business dragons are not horses they do not easily accept men upon their backs and when angered or threatened they attack monken's true telling tells us that 16 men lost their lives during the sewing three times that number were burned or maimed stefan darklin was burned to death whilst attempting to mount the dragon's sea smoke lord gorman massey suffered the same fate when approaching vermathor a man called silver dennis whose hair and eyes lent credence to his claim to be descended from a bastard son of maker the cruel had an arm torn off by sheepsteeler as his son struggled to staunch the wound the cannibal descended on them drove off sheepsteeler and devoured father and sons alike yet sea smoke vermethor and silverwing were accustomed to men and tolerant of their presence having once been ridden they were more accepting of new riders vermithor the old king's own dragon bent his neck to a blacksmith's bastard a towering man called hugh the hammer or hard hue whilst a pale-haired man at arms named off the white for his hair or off the sot for his drinking mounted silverwing beloved of good queen alisain and sea smoke who had once born lenar valerian took on to his back a boy of 10 and 5 known as adam of hull whose origins remain a matter of dispute amongst historians to this day adam and his brother aline one year younger had been born to a woman named marilda the pretty young daughter of a shipwright a familiar sight about her father's shipyards the girl was better known as mouse for she was small quick and always underfoot she was still 16 when she gave birth to adam in 114 ac and barely 18 when a lean followed in 115. small and quick as their mother these bastards of hull were both of silver hair and purple of eye and soon proved to have sea salt in their blood as well growing up in their grand sire shipyard and going to sea as ships boys before the age of eight when adam was 10 and a lean nine their mother inherited the shipyards upon their father's death sold them and used the coin to take the sea herself as mistress of a trading cog she named mouse a canny traitor and daring captain by 130 ac merida of whole owned seven ships and her bastard sons were always serving on one or the other that adam and aleene were dragon seed no man who looked upon them could doubt though their mothers steadfastly refused to name their father only when prince jacarys put out the call for new dragon riders did marilda at last break her silence claiming both boys were the natural sons of the late sir laynor velaryon they had his look it was true and sir lenore had been known to visit the shipyard in hull from time to time nonetheless many on dragonstone and driftmark were skeptical of murielda's claim for laynor velaryon's disinterest in women was well remembered none dared to name her liar however four it was lenore's own father lord corliss himself who brought the boys to prince chicaris for the sowing having outlived all his children and suffered the betrayal of his nephews and cousins the sea snake seemed more than eager to accept those newfound grandsons and when adam of hull mounted sorlenor's dragon sea smoke it seemed to prove the truth of his mother's claims it should not surprise us therefore that grand maester monken and septon eustis both dutifully assert sir lenore's parentage but mushroom as ever dissents in his testimony the fool puts forth the notion that the little mice had been sired not by the sea snake's son but by the sea snake himself lord corliss did not share sir layner's erotic predispositions he points out and the whole shipyards were like unto a second home to him whereas his son visited them less frequently princess rhaenys his wife had the fiery temperament of many targaryens mushroom says and would not have taken kindly to her lord husband fathering bastards on a girl half her age and a shipwright's daughter besides therefore his lordship had prudently ended his shipyard trysts with mouse after elene's birth commanding her to keep her boys far from court only after the death of princess rhaenys did lord corliss at last feel able to bring his bastard safely forward in this instance it must be said the tale told by the fool seems more likely than the versions offered by septon and maester many and more of queen rhaenyra's chord must surely have suspected the same if so they held their tongues not long after adam of hull had proved himself by flying sea smoke lord corliss went so far as to petition queen rhaenyra to remove the taint of bastardy from him and his brother when prince jacares added his voice to the request the queen complied adam of whole dragon seed and bastard became adam valerion heir to drift mark yet that did not write an end to the red sowing more and worse was yet to come with dire consequences for the seven kingdoms dragonstone's three wild dragons were less easily claimed than those that had known previous riders yet attempts were made upon them all the same sheepsteeler a notably ugly mud brown dragon hatched when the old king was still young had a taste for mutton swooping down on shepherd's flocks from driftmark to the wind water he seldom harmed the shepherds unless they attempted to interfere with him but had been known to devour the occasional sheepdog grey ghost dwelt in a smoking vent high on the eastern side of the dragonmont preferred fish and was most off to glimpse flying low over the narrow sea snatching prey from the waters a pale gray white beast the color of morning mist he was a notably shy dragon who avoided men and their works for years at a time the largest and oldest of the wild dragons was the cannibal so named because he had been known to feed on the carcasses of dead dragons and descend upon the hatcheries of dragonstone to gorge himself on newborn hatchlings and eggs coal black with baleful green eyes the cannibal head made his layer on dragonstone even before the coming of the targaryens some smokeflog claimed grand maester monken and septon eustis both found the story most unlikely as do i would be dragon tamers had made attempts to ride him a dozen times his lair was littered with their bones none of the dragon seeds were full enough to disturb the cannibal any who were did not return to tell their tales some sought the grey ghost but cannot find him for he was ever an elusive creature sheepsteeler proved easier to flush out but he remained a vicious ill-tempered beast who killed more seeds than the three castle dragons together one who hoped to tame him after his quest for grey ghost proved fruitless was a lean of hull sheep steeler would have none of him when he stumbled from the dragon's lair with his cloak of flame only his brother's swift action saved his life sea smoke drove the wild dragon off as adam used his own cloak to beat out the flames aline velaryon would carry the scars of the encounter on his back and legs for the rest of his long life many of the other seeds and seekers who aspire to ride upon sheepstealer's back ended in sheepsteeler's belly instead in the end the brown dragon was brought to heal by the cunning and persistence of a small brown girl of 6 and 10 who delivered him a freshly slaughtered sheep every morning until sheepsteeler learned to accept and expect her munkin sets down the name of the unlikely dragon rider as nettles mushroom tells us the girl was a bastard of a certain birth called neddy born to a dockside by any name she was a black-haired brown-eyed brown-skinned skinny foul-mouthed fearless and the first and last rider of the dragon sheepstealer thus did prince chicaris achieve his goal for all the death and pain it caused the widows left behind the burned men who would carry their scars until the day they died four new dragon riders had been found as 129 ac drew to a close the prince prepared to fly against king's landing the date he chose for the attack was the first full moon of the new year yet the plans of men are but playthings to the gods for even as jace laid out his plans a new thread was closing from the east the schemes of otto hightower had borne fruit meeting in tyrosh the high council of the triarchy had accepted his offer of an alliance ninety warships swept from the stepstones under the banners of the three daughters bending their oars for the gullet and as chance and the gods would have it the pentoshi cog gay abandon carrying two targaryen princes sailed straight into their teeth the escorts sent to protect the cog were sunk or taken the gay abandoned captured the tale reached dragonstone only when prince aegon arrived desperately clinging to the neck of his dragon stormcloud the boy was white with terror mushroom tells us shaking like a leaf and stinking of piss only nine he had never flown before and would never fly again for stormcloud had been terribly wounded as he fled the gay abandoned arriving with the stubs of countless arrows embedded in his belly and a scorpion bolt through his neck he died within the hour hissing as the hot blood gushed black and smoking from his wounds aegin's younger brother prince viserys had no way of escaping from the cog a clever boy he hid his dragon's egg and changed into ragged salt-stained clothing pretending to be no more than a common ship's boy but one of the real ship's boys betrayed him and he was made a captive it was a tairoshi captain who first realized whom he had monken writes but the admiral of the fleet shirako lohar of lis soon relieved him of his prize the lyceni admiral divided his fleet for the attack one pincer was to enter the gullet of south of dragonstone the other to the north in the early morning hours of the fifth day of the 130th year since aegon's conquest battle was joined scirocco's warships swept in with the rising sun behind them hidden by the glare they took many of lord valerian's galleys unawares ramming some and swarming aboard others with ropes and grapples leaving dragonstone unmolested the southern squadron fell upon the shores of driftmark landing men at spice town and sending fire ships into the harbor to set ablaze the ships coming out to meet them by mid-morning spice town was burning whilst mirish and tairoshi troops battered at the very doors of high tide when prince jacaris swept down upon a line of lyceni galleys on vermax a reign of spears and arrows rose up to meet him the sailors of the triarchy had faced dragons before whilst warring against prince damon in the stepstones no man could fault their courage they were prepared to meet dragonflame with such weapons as they had killed the rider and the dragons will depart their captains and commanders had told them one ship took fire and then another still the men of the free cities fought on until a shout rang out and they looked up to see more winged shapes coming around the dragonmon and turning toward them it is one thing to face a dragon another to face five as silver wing sheep steeler sea smoke and vermi-thor descended upon them the men of the triarchy felt their courage desert them the line of warships shattered as one galley after another turned away the dragons fell like thunderbolts spitting balls of fire blue and orange red and gold each brighter than the next ship after ship burst asunder or was consumed by flames screaming men leapt into the sea shrouded in fire tall columns of black smoke rose up from the water all seemed lost all was lost several differing tales were told afterward of how and why the dragon fell some claimed a crossbowman put an iron bolt through his eye but this version seems suspiciously similar to the way miraxis met her and long ago in dorne another account tells us that a sailor in the crow's nest of amirish galley cast a grapnel as vermax was swooping through the fleet one of its prongs found purchase between two scales and was driven deep by the dragon's own considerable speed the sailor had coiled his end of the chain about the mast and the weight of the ship and the power of vermax's wings tore a long jagged gash in the dragon's belly the dragon's shriek of rage was heard as far off as spice town even through the clanger of battle his flight jerked to a violent end vermax went down smoking and screaming clawing at the water survivors said he struggled to rise only to crash headlong into a burning galley wood splintered the mass came tumbling down and the dragon thrashing became entangled in the rigging when the ship healed over and sank vermax sank with her it is said that jacaris velaryon leapt free and clung to a piece of smoking wreckage for a few heartbeats until some crossbowmen on the nearest mirror ship began loosing quarrels at him the prince was struck once and then again more and more mere men brought crossbows to bear finally one quarrel took him through the neck and jace was swallowed by the sea the battle in the gullet raged into the night north and south of dragonstone and remains amongst the bloodiest sea battles in all of history shirako lohar had taken a combined fleet of 90 mirish lyceni and tairoshi warships from the stepstones 28 survived to limp home all but three crewed by lyceni in the aftermath the widows of mir and tyrosh accuse the admiral of sending their fleets to destruction whilst holding back his own beginning the quarrel that would spell the end of the triarchy two years later when the three cities turn against each other in the daughter's war but that is outside the scope of this tale though the attackers bypassed dragonstone no doubt believing that the ancient targaryen stronghold was too strong to assault they exacted a grievous toll on driftmark spicetown was brutally sacked the bodies of men women and children butchered in the streets and left as fodder for gulls and rats and carrion crows its buildings burned the town would never be rebuilt high tide was put to the torch as well all the treasures the sea snake had brought back from the east were consumed by fire his servants cut down as they tried to flee the flames the valerian fleet lost almost a third of its strength thousands died yet none of these losses were felt so deeply as that of jacaris velaryon prince of dragonstone and heir to the iron throne rhaenyra's youngest son seemed lost as well in the confusion of battle none of the survivors seemed quite certain which ship prince viserys had been on men on both sides presumed him dead drowned or burned or butchered and though his brother eagan the younger had fled and lived all the joy had gone out of the boy he would never forgive himself for leaping onto stormcloud and abandoning his little brother to the enemy it is written that when the sea snake was congratulated on his victory the old man said if this be victory i pray i never win another mushroom tells us that there were two men on dragonstone that night who drank to the slaughter in a smoky tavern beneath the castle the dragon riders hew the hammer and off the white who had flown vermathor and silverwing into battle and live to boast of it we are nights now truly hardhugh declared an oaf laughed and said i fight on that we should be lords the girl nettles did not share their celebrations she had flown with the others fought as bravely burned and killed as they had but her face was black with smoke and streaked with tears when she returned to dragonstone and adam velaryon lately adam of hull sought out the sea snake after the battle what they spoke to each other even mushroom does not say a fortnight later in the reach ormond hightower found himself caught between two armies thaddeus rowan lord of golden grove and tom flowers bastard of bitter bridge were bearing down on him from the northeast with a great host of mountain knights while sir allen beesberry lord alan tarley and lord owen costain had joined the power to cut off his retreat to old town when their host closed around him on the banks of the river honeywine attacking front and rear at once lord hightower saw his lines crumble defeat seemed imminent until a shadow swept across the battlefield and a terrible roar resounded overhead slicing through the sound of steel on steel a dragon had come the dragon was tesarion the blue queen cobalt and copper on her back rode the youngest of queen allison's three sons darren targaryen 15. lord orman squire that same gentle and soft-spoken lad who had once been milk brother to prince chicaris the arrival of prince darren and his dragon reversed the tide of battle now was lord orman's men attacking screaming curses at their foes whilst the queen's men fled by day's end lord rowan was retreating north with the remnants of his host tom flowers laid dead and burned amongst the reeds the two allens had been taken captive and lord costain was dying from a wound given to him by bold john roxton's black blade the orphan maker as wolves and ravens fed upon the bodies of the slain ormond hightower feasted prince darren on arocs and strong wine and dubbed him a night with the storied valyrian long sword vigilance naming him sardaran the daring the prince modestly replied my lord is kind to say so but the victory belongs to tesarion on dragonstone an air of despondence and defeat hung over the black court when the disaster on the honeywine became known to them lord var emmon went so far as to suggest that mayhap's time had come to bend their knee to aegon ii the queen would have none of it however only the gods truly knew the hearts of men and women are full of strange broken by the loss of one son rhaenyra targaryen seemed to find new strength after the loss of a second jace's death hardened her burning away her fears leaving only her anger and her hatred still possessed of more dragons than her half-brother her grace now resolved to use them no matter the cost she would rain down fire and death upon aegin and all those who supported him she told the black council and either tear him from the iron throne or die in the attempt a similar resolve had taken root across the bay in the breast of eamonn targaryen ruling in his brother's name whilst aegon lay a bed contemptuous for his half-sister rhaenyra eamonn one eye saw a greater threat in his uncle prince damon and the great host he had gathered at harrenhal summoning his bannermen and council the prince announced his intent to bring the battle to his uncle and chastise the rebellious riverlords he proposed to strike the riverlands from both east and west and thus forced the lords of the trident to fight on two fronts at once jason lannister had assembled a formidable host in the western hills a thousand nights and seven times as many archers and men at arms let him descend from the high ground and cross the red fork with fire and sword while sir christian cole marched forth from king's landing accompanied by prince aemon himself on vegar the two armies would converge on harrenhal to crush the traitors of the trident between them and if his uncle emerged from behind the castle walls to oppose them as he surely must vegar would overcome caraxies and prince aymond would return to the city with prince damon's head not all the members of the green council favored the prince's bold stroke eamonn had the support of sir christian cole the hand and of sir tylen lannister but grand maester orwell urged him to send word to stormzand and add the power of house baratheon to his own before proceeding and ironrod lord jasper wilde declared that he should summon lord hightower and prince darren from the south on the grounds that true dragons are better than one the queen dowager favored caution as well urging her son to wait until his brother the king and his dragon sunfire the golden were healed so they might join the attack prince eamonn had no taste for such delays however he had no need of his brothers or the dragons he declared aegon was too badly hurt darren too young i karaxis was a fearsome beast savage and cunning and battle tested but vegard was older fiercer and twice as large septon eustis tells us that the kinslayer was determined that this should be his victory he had no wish to share the glory with his brothers not any other man nor could he be gain said for until agent ii rose from his bed to take up his sword again the regency and rule were eamon's true to his resolve the prince rode forth from the gate of the gods within a fortnight at the head of a host four thousand strong 16 days march to harren hall he proclaimed on the 17th we will feast inside black herons hall whilst my uncle's head looks down from my spear and across the realm obedient to his command jason lannister lord of casterly rock poured down out of the western hills descending with all his power upon the red fork and the heart of the riverlands the lords of the trident had no choice but to turn and meet him damon targaryen was too old and seasoned at badler to sit idly by and let himself be penned up inside the walls even walls as massive as harrenhal's the prince still had friends in king's landing and word of his nephew's plans had reached him even before eamonn had set out when told that eamonn and sir christian cole had left king's landing it is said prince damon laughed and said past time for he had long anticipated this moment a murder of ravens took flight from the twisted towers of harrenhal on the red fork lord jason lannister found himself facing the lord of pink maiden old peter piper and the lord of wayfarer's rest tristan vance though the western men outnumbered their foes the riverlords knew the ground thrice the lannisters tried to force the crossing and thrice they were driven back in the last attempt lord jason was dealt a moral wound at the hand of a grizzled squire pate of longleaf lord piper himself knighted this man afterward dubbing him longleaf the lion's lair the fourth lannister attack carried the forwards however this time it was lord vance who fell slain by sir adrian tarbeck who had taken command of the western host tarbeck and a hundred picked knights stripped off their heavy armor and swam the river upstream of battle then circled about to take lord vance's lines from the rear the ranks of the river lord shattered and the western men came swarming across the red fork by the thousands meanwhile unbeknownst to the dying lord jason and his bannermen fleets of longships from the iron islands fell upon the shores of the lannister's domains led by dalton greyjoy of pike courted by both claimants to the iron throne the red kraken had made his choice his ironman could not hope to breach casually rock once lady joanna had barter gates but they seized three quarters of the ships in the harbor sank the rest then swarmed over the walls of lannisport to sack the city making off with uncounted wealth and more than 600 women and girls including lord jason's favorite mistress and natural daughters elsewhere in the realm lord wallace mooton led a hundred nights out of maidenpool to join with the half-wild crabs and broons of crack law point and the celtigars of claw isle through piney woods and miss shrouded hills they hastened to brook's rest where their sudden appearance took the garrison by surprise after retaking the castle lord mooton led his bravest men to the field of ashes west of the castle to put an end to the dragon sunfire the would-be dragon slayers easily drove off the cordon of guards who had been left to feed serve and protect the dragon but sunfire himself proved more formidable than expected dragons are awkward creatures on the ground and his torn wing left the great gold worm unable to take to the air the attacker is expected to find the beast near death instead they found him sleeping but the clash of swords and thunder of horses soon roused him and the first spear to strike him provoked him to fury slimy with mud twisting amongst the bones of countless sheep sunfire arrived and coiled like a serpent his tail lashing standing blast of golden flame at his attackers as he struggled to fly thrice he rose and thrice fell back to earth moon's men swarmed him with swords and spears and axes dealing him many grievous wounds yet each blow only seemed to rage him further the number of the dead reached three score before the survivors fled amongst the slain was wallace mutin lord of maidenpool when his body was found a fortnight later by his brother manfred not remained but charred flesh in melted armor crawling with maggots yet nowhere on the field of ashes littered with the bodies of brave men in the burned and bloated carcasses of a hundred horses did lord manfred find king aegen's dragon sunfire was gone nor were there tracks as surely there would have been had the dragon dragged himself away sunfire the golden had taken wing again it seemed but to where no living man could say meanwhile prince damon targaryen himself hastened south on the wings of his dragon karaxis flying above the western shore of the god's eye well away from sir christian's line of march he evaded the enemy host crossed the black water then turned east following the river downstream to king's landing and on dragonstone rhaenyra targaryen donned a suit of gleaming black scale mounted cerax and took flight as a rainstorm lashed the waters of blackwater bay high above the city the queen and her prince consort came together circling over aegon's high hill the sight of them incited terror in the streets of the city below for the small folk were not slow to realize that the attack they had dreaded was at last at hand prince aymond and sir christian had denuded king's landing of defenders when they set forth to retake harrenhal and the kinslayer had taken vegar that fearsome beast leaving only dream fire and a handful of half-grown hatchlings to oppose the queen's dragons the young dragons had never been ridden and dreamfire's rider queen helena was a broken woman the city had as well been dragonless thousands of small folks streamed out the city gates carrying their children and worldly possessions on their backs to seek safety in the countryside others dug pits and tunnels under their hovels dark dank holes where they hoped to hide whilst the city burned grand maester monken tells us that many of the hidden passageways and secret sub-sellers under king's landing date from this time rioting broke out in flea bottom when the sails of the sea snake ships were seen to the east in blackwater bay making for the river the bells of every sept in the city began to ring and mobs surged through the streets looting as they went dozens died before the gold cloaks could restore the peace with both the lord protector and the king's hand absent and king agen himself burned bedridden and lost in poppy dreams it fell to his mother the queen dowager to see to the city's defenses queen allison rose to the challenge closing the gates of castle and city sending the gold cloaks to the walls and dispatching riders on swift horses to find prince aymond and fetch him back as well she commanded the grand maester orwell to send ravens to all our leel lords summoning them to the defense of their true king when orwell hastened back to his chambers however he found four gold cloaks waiting for him one man muffled his cries as the others beat and bound him with a bag pulled over his head the grand maester was escorted down to the black cells queen allison's riders got no farther than the gates where more gold cloaks took them into custody unbeknownst to her grace the seven captains commanding the gates chosen for their loyalty to king again had been imprisoned or murdered the moment caraxies appeared in the sky above the red keep for the rank and file of the city watch still loved daemon targaryen the prince of the city who had commanded them of old queen ellison's brother sir gwayne hightower second in command of the gold cloaks rushed to the stables intending to sound the warning he was seized disarmed and dragged before his commander luther largent when hightower denounced him as a turn cloak sir luthor laughed diamond gave us these clothes he said and no gold no matter how you turn them he then drove his sword through sir wayne's belly and ordered the city gates open to the men pouring off the sea snake ships for all the vaunted strength of its walls king's landing fell in less than a day a short bloody fight was waged at the river gate where 13 high tower knights and a hundred minute arms drew off the gold cloaks and held out for nigh on eight hours against attacks from both within and without the city but the heroics were in vain for rhynirs soldiers poured in through the other six gates unmolested the sight of the queen's dragons in the sky above took the heart out of the opposition and king aegin's remaining loyalists hid or fled or bent the knee one by one the dragons made their descent sheepsteeler lighted a top of senya's hill silverwing and vermethor on the hill of rhaenys outside the dragonpit prince damon circled the towers of the red key before bringing caraxies down in the outer ward only when he was certain that the defenders would offer him no harm did he signal for his wife the queen to descend upon cerex adam valerion remained aloft flying sea smoke around the city walls the beat of his dragon's wide leathern wings a caution to those below that any defiance would be met with fire upon seeing that the resistance was hopeless the dowager queen alicent emerged from maegor's holdfast with her father serado hightower sir tylen lannister and lord jasper wilde of the iron rod lord lara strong was not with them the master of whispers had somehow contrived to disappear septon eustis a witness of what followed tells us that the queen allison attempted to treat with her stepdaughter let us summon together a great council as the old king did in the days of old said the dowager queen and lay the matter of succession before the lords of the realm but queen rhaenyra rejected the proposal with scorn do you mistake me for mushroom she asked we both know how this council would rule then she paid her stepmother choose yield or burn bowing her head in defeat queen elsin surrendered the keys to the castle and ordered her knights and men at arms to lay down their swords the city is yours princess she is reported to have said but you will not hold it long the rats play when the cat is gone but my son aemond will return with fire and blood rhaenyra's men found her rival's wife the madqueen helena locked in her bed chamber but when they broke down the door of the king's apartments they discovered only his bed empty and his chamber pot fool again ii had fled so had his children the six-year-old princess jahera and two-year-old prince maylor along with willis fell and rick and thorne of the kingsguard not even the dowager queen seemed to know where they had gone and luther largent swore none had passed through the city gates there was no way to spirit away the iron throne however nor would queen rhaenyra sleep until she claimed her father's seat so the torches were lit in the throne room and the queen climbed the iron steps and seated herself where king viserys had sat before her and the old king before him and maegor and aenes and egan the dragon in days of old stern face still in her armor she sat on high as every man and woman in the red keep was brought forth and made to kneel before her to plead for her forgiveness and swear their lives and swords and honor to her as their queen septon eustis tells us that the ceremony went all through the night it was well past dawn when rainier targaryen rose and made her descent and as her lord husband prince damon escorted her from the hall cuts were seen upon her grace's legs and the palm of her left hand wrote eustace drops of blood filled to the floor as she went past and wise men looked at one another though none dared to speak the truth aloud the iron throne had spurned her and her days upon it would be few fire and blood chapter 15. dying of the dragons thank you for listening if you enjoyed this please hit the subscribe button to this channel to
