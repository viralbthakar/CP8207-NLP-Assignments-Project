 [Music] [Applause] [Music] ladies and gentlemen thank you for your patience in waiting for us tonight thank you for that amazing welcome for a man who as it transpires really does need no introduction I'm gonna go ahead and say it one of my favorite authors one of the great American authors thank you one of the great fantasy history horror you name the genre he's done it he's mastered in this book fire and blood the narrative nonfiction history form which is infuriating for me because I've based my entire career on doing that cast your mind back if you will a quarter of a century now I suppose take us back to the origins of when you started thinking about Westeros I mean did you expect that it would end up with with Awards and multi-million sales all over the world no no and and for a long time it didn't look as though it would it's when I speak to young writers and I'm sure there are some people in this auditorium who dream of writing themselves some of you probably are writing yourselves maybe even submitting your stories and novels I always stress what a uncertain profession it is I mean if you're someone who needs security don't become a writer it's it's a profession for for gamblers you can be very hot one minute and the next minute your publishers dropped you and your agent isn't returning your calls and all you can do I think in what what I've always tried to do throughout my career is write the best book you can and turn it over to your agent and your publisher hope they do a good job getting it out and hope that the audience finds it and likes it with you know Game of Thrones came along after I had already been in the business for quite some time I sold my first story in 1971 I didn't start writing Game of Thrones until 1991 so I was already 20 years in as a writer a novelist also a vision writer/producer and it came out in in 96 publishers paid me quite a substantial sum of money for it especially thankfully my British publishers but then when when it first came out it did not set the world on fire it did okay but it didn't it wasn't a breakthrough bestseller that the that people thought it would be but it built and that's the you know promotion is great advertising is great you need all of those to really help launch a book but the best is word-of-mouth and when when the people would read the first book told their friends about it and and those friends told other friends and people that started discussing it online and the primitive version of the internet that existed back then and finally when the second book came out it did better than the first one and that was the first book of mine to hit any bestseller west not necessarily the Nielsen list which I'm sure I didn't touch in in 1996 in 1999 but we were on the New York Times bestseller list with the second book we were on in number 13 for one week and then we were off the list but the third book did better than that the fourth book debuted at number one on the New York Times list and stayed there for a while and you know then the TV show came along and after that I kind of moved into the bestsellers permanently and built a nice guesthouse there and so it's it's it's really I think fans telling other fans and people sharing that that that builds up the momentum but I know I had no idea that would ever be this big I hope that the books would be were received that they would sell well enough for me to continue to write them and that people would like them and thankfully they have now as you said by that point you'd written extensively in science fiction genre you'd written some horror if you think about fever dream you've worked in television as a writer and a producer where did this world come from I was reading a letter by Tolkien this week which he wrote in in the 1950s about his you know his fantasy world of elves and Hobbit on and Tolkien said in the letter this stuff began with me i mean i do not remember a time when i was not building it i've been at it since i could write I mean was that your experience with this material had you had you been percolating it for years or did it come to you in a sort of flash what was the process I published my first novel in 1977 science fiction novel dying in white and I had published four novels three of them three of them had done increasingly well the fourth novel the Armageddon rag although it got me quite a substantial advance was a commercial failure so I had to go out and Hollywood for ten years I did not have any immediate script assignments in television or film so I thought well okay it's been a few years since I wrote a novel I will begin one and I started writing a science fiction novel called Avalon which was part of my Thousand worlds future history that I'd written a lot of stories about in them in the 70s and I was going well I'd been thinking about that one percolating that one for some years but then one day suddenly this chapter came to me almost like preformed in my head and it was the chapter where brand finds to the dire wolf pups in the summer snow it came to me so vividly that I knew I had to write it so I I put 'evil on the side I put it back in a drawer and I I sat down to write this chapter I didn't know what it was part of was a standalone short story was it part of a book by the time I finished that chapter and only took me two or three days I already knew what the next chapter had to be so I went on I wrote that and I wrote the one after that and so it all started it all started building for me in the summer of 1991 and I think I wrote about a hundred pages that summer and then Hollywood kicked up again suddenly my agent sold a television pilot for me so I put Game of Thrones in the drawer as well and went out and did a pilot and then I did some backup scripts of the pilot and I did another pilot I wrote a feature film none of them ever got made it was like three years until I returned to Game of Thrones but you know when I did it was like I'd put it down yesterday which was hugely huge for me because you know from periodically I take out those pages of Avalon that I also put a sudden 91 and they're ice cold I have no idea where I was going or what I was doing it's all faded away but it did not do that on Game of Thrones the book had such a cause of me so deep the characters I guess I'd been thinking about them in the back of my head all those intervening years we've been doing other stuff so I got right back into it in in 93 and 94 and then we we sold it and the rest is imaginary history and so is that where it starts for you with the characters first and then you build a world around them but it did it start with the Starks in this case in that case I started with a scene a scene and as I wrote the scene I learned who the Caroline I mean I knew it's hard to remember now after all these years like something like almost 30 years but um I knew the protagonists of that scene had to be a young boy who wouldn't really quite understand everything that was going on and I knew he was part of a large family I knew I wanted I wanted the dire wolf pups found I wanted the found in the summer snow that phrase was there right from the beginning I don't know where it came from but I knew they it was the summer snows and that put me on a line to the unsteadiness of the seasons and there's something wrong in this world with our normal seasons that you're getting snow in the middle of summer I've often said that there are two two types of writers two archetypes if you will the architect and the gardener and the architect writes books the way an architect plans a house I mean an architect knows how many rooms they're going to be and and what the roof is going to be like and where the plumbing goes and where the bathrooms are and how is it heated as it forced there he did is it baseboard heated is it electrical he knows everything it's all there on blueprints planned before single-board is purchased or a single nail is driven the gardener digs a hole in the ground and throws in a seed and waters it and he hopes something comes up now he knows generally what's gonna come up he knows whether he plants at a an acorn for an oak tree or a tomato plant to get some tomatoes for the summer but there's a lot of details he doesn't know you know it may not grow at all it may grow a little and then die it may you know go wild the chipmunk may eat it during the night you don't know obviously I don't think any writer is a hundred percent architect or a hundred percent gardener but I'm at least 97% gardener and that I think I have that in common with Tolkien you know when he set out to write Lord of the Rings it was supposed to be a sequel to The Hobbit well let's have another Hobbit story another little adventure of the hobbits like like the one you did with Bilbo and he said the tale grew in the telling and indeed it did it grew grew to something much bigger than they thought when I started out and mine has done that same thing you've going back to a game of Thrones you know when you read those first chapters that you know you've described writing in in the early 90s there I was very struck with how much of the history of this world you seemed to have already written things that you know are recounted in greater depth and detail in fire and blood seemed you know Aegon's conquest the beginning how did this world come about what were its major political turning points and there that's reflected it seems to me as a reader through even when I read the early Duncan egg stuff you know the hedge Knight again we've got this really strong sense of the history of the realm of the Blackfyre rebellion sort of hanging in the background how much of that history did you have to map as you went along in order to fill out the world well I know none of it when I began I it's been a simultaneous process you know I wrote that first chapter and you know names came to me and all I had I had some vague sense and then when I wrote the second chapter or the King is coming where is he coming from at some point at some point in that process I said hmm I better have a map so I got out of people piece piece of typing paper and and you know initially I found a map of Ireland and turned it upside down and I put that in but I said well I don't want it to be too visible so I'll change some of it and then I said I can't fit it all on this map so I'll need another piece of typing paper so you got the South on one piece and the north on the other and I gradually filled them in as I went and all that and it was the same with the Kings and people would occasionally mentioned the king or the old king and Aegon the conquerer well I better sit down at some point figure out who these Kings are so I so I won't contradict my and I made up a list of however mentor garyun Kings there are and dates for them and trying to vary them and at first it was just a list of names but as I got deeper and deeper into it even as I'm writing about the present day characters the the past characters the background characters are achieving more and more reality in in my head and the world got progressively more complicated we've had some questions which I'm going to feed in throughout this conversation and one of them kind of these are from some some of them from people in the audience some of them are from social media followers and one of them sort of pertains to what you're talking about this is a question from Adrian Maduro who says how is your workspace organized to write a song of ice and fire do you have a corkboard like in police investigations where you've noted all the targaryen x' and the and all the phrase versus Adrian give us a physical sense of how you write and where you write well I I don't have a corkboard I have maps now web is there's been a beautiful map book called the lands of Ice and Fire so I printed out those large scale maps and I keep them around me so I can refer it to the maps from time to time most of the stuff is actually in my head I do have computer files you know with timelines on them and that I've put together over the years and bits of this and bits of that that I can consult from time again it is sometimes a daunting task more so nowadays then when I began back in 1991 because the world has become so much bigger and it's become so much more complex in in many ways I followed the template of Tolkien you know if you look at Lord of the Rings everything begins in the Shire and with the with the hobbits and then as they leave the Shire they make it to Rivendell and they meet some more people they pick up Strider they pick up the rest of the Fellowship but then from that point they start to split off first they split into two groups and then the two groups put into three groups and etc well I followed more or less the same map but I mean if you if you look at Game of Thrones everybody except Danny is together in Winterfell in the beginning all the viewpoint characters there and but then they start splitting and Danny is still off by herself on another continent but you know some of my people go to King's Landing some of them stay in in Winterfell and then the people go to sick King's Landing gets separated from each other and they go and different and every time a character goes off on a different tangent they meet other supporting characters so at this point I'm really writing not a novel but twelve intertwined novels and each character has is in a different place with their own antagonists their own friends their own secondary and tertiary surrounding them and yes that is very difficult to keep in my head I maybe should have organized it all better when I began back in 1991 but I never thought it would get to that I mean remember I'd written I'd written four novels before this Armageddon rag fever dream when Haven with least a total dying at a life I've never had any problems keeping those characters in my head I didn't need corkboards or anything I just remembered it all I had no idea though that when I got into this that the size the that it would eventually become unfortunately you know we it's the age of computers we have search and replace functions and I I can I can load up you know my my giant Yantic file and said okay what what did I ever say about this character and I go through even though I make mistakes as and my fans like you people and even more obsessive people elsewhere are always eager to point out whenever I've made a mistake i i have particular trouble with the color of people's eyes and and rather famously I have a horse to change his gender between the first and second books it's I don't have it's hard to do a search and replace for the sex of a horse so but you know these these errors do they're sneaking do you ever find you've pet you sort of painted yourself into a corner and you've set up a part of the world that then impedes your story tone yeah that is the disadvantage of being a gardener you know the architect never finds himself building closed rooms that go nowhere but the gardener sometimes traipse down the branch and finds himself sitting all the way at the out at the end realizing he can't get from that branch anywhere else so sometimes I do go down byways and say no I think I took the wrong turn back like three chapters ago let me rewrite these chapters or in one case or remove these chapters I never destroy them I keep them on my computer in case I see a way to put them in later there's always that there's rather famously from from the book that was published as with dragons I had a chapter where Tyrion was was moving down the river river rowing and the shy made and and I wrote this chapter where he meets a character called the shrouded Lord and it's a it's a really good chapter I mean I like some chapters more than others this is a terrific chapter but it it said absolutely dead end admitted what enough the dead end but introduces like three additional layers of complication that I didn't think I actually needed but I liked it so much I kept trying to fit it in you know at first I presented it straight and then I said oh I can't fit it now presented as a dream Tyrion has a dream and he dreams that this happened to him and it has portents and then I split it all him into like eight dreams and every tyrion chapter he dreamed a little bit of it and and finally I gave up and said I can't I have to rip out all this stuff it doesn't it doesn't do me any good someday maybe I have when I finished a whole book I'll publish that that lost chapter is a little standalone there's a question here from again from somebody I think who may be in the orders from crystal Phillips who says are there any scenes in A Song of Ice and Fire that you look back on and smile because they were just so much fun to write I mean that sounds like one but it's not in a sum of ice and fire are there any that you you know you mentioned that the the first scene with bran are there any that really just get you would give you a tingle when you look back on them there are certainly scenes that I that I remember but they tend not to be the ones that are fun to write they tend to be happy the ones they're painful to write I mean the hardest thing I ever wrote was to read wedding scene and in a Storm of Swords and I knew that was coming I was enough of a architect there that I was I was building toward that scene I've been building therefore that scene since the first book but when I actually reached that saying it was too painful to write I couldn't write it I skipped over it I should say it occurs about two-thirds of the way through Storm of Swords I skipped over it and I wrote the scenes that follow I finished the entire book and I hadn't written that scene yet that was the last thing I wrote for stormer swords I had to go back and make myself write it and it it's still emotionally you become very attached to these characters believe it or not I don't have the reputation for gleefully killing some of them but that's not entirely deserved sometimes it's very painful for me to kill them they're there you know my children for good or ill so that was a tough scene to write I do periodically enjoy you know if I write something that I'm particularly proud of that or it really is that I think is a good piece of writing that is vivid and evocative then that gives me pleasure but it might not necessarily be the scenes that that you guys would particularly enjoy some of them are just quiet things about oh I have to describe this landscape and I sweat and we write it and rewrite it and I finally give yeah this is a great description of three guys writing through a grassy meadow I've gotten the sights and the sounds and the smells of the scene right - to put you there but it's not necessarily anything that ordinary readers or reviewers who ever oh my god there was such a beautiful description of the grassy meadow on page 314 so but at what point did you start to write outside the confines of the song and I solid ice and fire cycle and I'm thinking here of the dunk and egg hedge Knight stuff because that seemed I mean that was published quite early in was that conceived as part of this story that just didn't fit how did that come about that was Robert Silverberg fault Robert Silverberg decided he was going to do an anthology called legends which consisted of original stories he wanted ten fantasy writers each writing a story in their fantasy world an original story never before published and he was offering what was quite a substantial advance er I think a record events for story in any any anthology so and his lineup was amazing it was you know Terry Pratchett and Stephen King were going to be in this and Anne McCaffrey and well you know all of the best-selling fantasy writers and I was just getting into my series then I really didn't belong in that number but I knew that I wanted to be in this book so when he invited me to be in this book I lethally accepted and then I had to think well what am I gonna write for this book I'm still in the middle of writing I think I was still in the middle of writing Clash of Kings I mean the only book out then was with Game of Thrones well am I gonna write a story about Tyrion or ru or Jon Snow no I can't do that I have to save that but a book I have to do this I have to do a prequel so I started thinking about my history and what would be a good area to write it and I came up with the the duncan egg stuff I was particularly attracted that whole story is built around a tournament and I love medieval tournaments and reading about them writing about them there there's of course some of them in the main the main books but this this was an opportunity in a time of peace not war to look at a medieval teal tournament with all its pageantry and the jousting in the combat and reveal a little of Westerosi history and like like many other things it grew I mean it did would I garden that I started it and suddenly it was it was all there actually I was so long doing it that Bob tried to throw me out of the book I was I was late delivering Clash of Kings which everybody knew about and he was approaching he'd gotten a lot of money for this anthology and he wanted to deliver it on a deadline so all the stories would do at the end of the year on December 31st and he said George I hear you so late from the book I can't afford my book to be late so I'm dropping you from the book and we're gonna replace you and I said no you're not I have a contract here and I'm not late yet you may think I'm gonna be late but I'm not late yet so you have to keep me in the book so that's why legends actually has eleven stories in it not the original 10 he actually replaced me and found another guy but I refuse to be replaced and I wrote the story and goddamn it I got a tomb on December 31st which is at the same time as I understand it like five of the stories came in so I'm not the only one that writer who who pushes things and actually I think that story that was one of the best decisions I ever made there was because there was a real jump in my sales figures between Game of Thrones and Clash of Kings and I think that story and legends had a lot to do it I've had a lot of people come up to me over the ensuing years and say I'd never heard of you I bought legends because there was a new Stephen King story in it but I loved your story and I started bringing her stuff or you know I'd never heard of you but I bought legends for the Terry Pratchett story and then I read your story and it was great and that's so I think I gained a lot of a lot of readers by being in legends do you plan to do anymore as ever as people who read the duncan egg stories yeah do you plan to do any more of them is this part of one of the a project HBO I do I've written three to date and I think I need to write another I don't know nine something like that but I have pretty well their entire lives in my head and of course all those things will become more details I write them but first I have to finish I have this book the winds of winter I have to finish that and then I can write another Dunkin egg story and then I read a dream of spring and then I write another Dunkin egg story at some point in there I have to write the second part of fire and blood so I have my work cut out for me why am I talking to you here I should be writing well you know George I wasn't going to ask about the winds were in there tell me about I mean you'll be obviously loved or you seem to love collaboration world-building tell me a little about wildcards because I know that's that's a totally different we got some blues a totally different world that you're building along with other writers yeah that one actually goes back further than further than Game of Thrones and started wildcards in the 60s or the 80s in 1986 or 87 around then it actually came out of I'm an old comic book fan that's how I started writing letters to Marvel Comics in the early 60s dear Stan and Jack you know I don't know why Stanley printed my letters it might be because in the first one I said Shakespeare move over Stanley has arrived he liked that for some reason but I always loved the the mythos of the superhero the this person with superpowers and in the early 80s would have a bunch of my friends in Albuquerque we were obsessively playing this role-playing game called super world and I don't know how many days weeks months years we obsessively played this game two or three times a week till 3:00 in the morning but at a certain point I said well this is great but we have all these great characters we have all these great stories and we're not getting any money for them we have to we have to figure out how to do this and get paid so I said it was the 80s shared worlds were big thing then thieves world different have you've read that Lea vac iskar there were a lot of them but no one had done a present-day superpower shared world so we came up with wildcards me and a group of friends and and then I reached out and I recruited other writers for it Roger Zelazny Pat Cadogan many we have like 35 writers in a wild-card consortium now and we've been doing these I'm the editor and I've been editing these books there are like 27 of them in print right now and at least two more originals on the way and we have two television series about the wild-card universe in the works from Hulu so hopefully while cars will be going for another 30 years it's a lot of fun to edit we have some amazing talents and some amazing characters in wildcards and we've just published the the first wild-card set entirely in the United Kingdom called knaves over Queens which is the wild card world but from the British point of view so check that one out I think you might enjoy it let's move I suppose from world building to television and can I ask how the process of sharing a world with other writers on the page that you've described wildcards compares to sharing a world the world of Westeros with other creators in Game of Thrones you know you might have heard of it the biggest TV show in the world you know what is what is easy what is difficult when you suddenly have to open this world out to other writers other creators other minds well there are challenges to it certainly you know when I first got involved in television in the in the mid 80s Twilight Zone was the first show I was hired to write for and then Beauty and the Beast and then I had five years of development where I was making of my own shows but remember I sold my first short story in 71 so from 71 to 85 I was active in the world of prose men short stories books and that's a very lonely existence it's you know you sitting in front of a computer screen with the cursor blinking trying to think up something to fill that screen and before computers it's you sitting in front of a typewriter which I did start on back in the beginning and facing a blank sheet of paper when I first got out to Hollywood I actually loved the idea of you know I'm working with all these other people and you know you're in a room you're on a show staff and you're writing things and then then like the next day later you're in the writers room and the other writers are critiquing what you wrote they're making suggestions you go back and you rewrite it you rewrite it maybe a couple times other people way in and then eventually gets greenlit to film and you're suddenly working with the with a director you're casting actors you're sitting in casting sections and actors some of whom you've actually heard of or coming in and reading your lines and you know it's it's it's a high the first story of mine ever produced was Roger Zelazny zhh and that my adaptation of Roger Leslie's last defender of Camelot the climax of which takes place in Stonehenge in another dimension and suddenly because of what Roger wrote and what I wrote in the script here's all these people building stonehenge on a set behind my behind my office that's real high and you know this is the social aspect visiting the set meeting the actors working with other writers who are you know very bright and talented going to dailies I mean coming into the office every day and your assistant brings you a cup of coffee and you know you have a script meeting at one point you have a casting session you watch the dailies from the previous day's shooting it's it's a whole different world than the lonely write a you're sitting in wrong in it is is it distracting no i i i love much of it but here's the other side of it the other side of the same coin is there's all these [ __ ] other people who are telling you what to do they all have [ __ ] opinions you know they don't like that line or day they they say my character wouldn't say that if they're an actor or the director wants the scene redone or the network won't let you do something that's studio say they don't have the money for it you know the other writers have different ideas so so it the same thing is well very good and very very bad very frustrating that you know there's no as a creative person there's no control greater than what you get when you are sitting all alone in front of a computer in front of a typewriter you're making up your world you can do anything you want your God in television you're sort of a God but sort of a minor God there are bigger gods above you they can smack you down at any time so two different ways of of telling stories and both of them have their pluses and minuses so you used to write an episode per season of the beginning you write an episode per season of Thrones or was it was that yes the contractual that was a country I had the option to write an episode every season because I knew you know me going back again to my ten years in television you know I I worked on Twilight Zone did a little bit of work on Max Headroom but my episodes were never filmed then I worked for three years the entire run of Beauty and the Beast at that point I'd risen through the ranks in the television hierarchy from from staff writer which was my first position you know that staff writer is a very lowly position because it's the only one that has the word writer in the title and then from there I moved up the story editor an executive story editor and co-producer producer supervising producer and I was set to become an executive producer a showrunner which is the you know the big title but then beauty to be extended and then I got a development deal with it just paying me Studios are paying me money to come up with ideas for TV shows to come up with ideas for TV movies feature films what-have-you and I wrote a number of those over the ensuing five years and that can be very lucrative but ultimately I found that very unsatisfying because nothing was made you know they they pay you and you have meetings meetings you get invested in the world you love these characters and then they don't they don't make them nobody nobody ever reads what you wrote except for guys in a room and I guess I discovered something about myself that I'm a little like an actor or something I want the applause or I want them to throw the rotten fruit of me but whatever I want to come out on the stage at the end of I'm done and know that an audience whether it's the audience in a theatre of a few hundred or whether it's an order audience of 20 million on the television sets of America has seen what I've come up with I wanted that but at that stage when I finally went back to two books with Game of Thrones I I really wanted to be a showrunner I wanted to do it and be the captain of the ship instead of just a the first mate or one of the swabbies but then 20 years passed and by the time Game of Thrones was ready to go to HBO number one I was right in the middle of a series I would I had four books out and I was struggling to finish dance with dragons at that time and I knew there were two more after that I couldn't you know being a showrunner on a television show is a 24 hour a day job I mean it's a hugely high-stress busy job this crises every day there's always something to do it takes all your attention I couldn't do that without abandoning the books entirely and that I wasn't willing to do books were still number one priority but I did want to keep my hand in so I got a contract that said I could write one episode per season and I did in the beginning seasons but it took me about a month to do each of those episodes even though they were adaptations almost in every case adaptations of scenes and material that I'd already written in the book so I was just really transferring it from one medium to another at a certain point when we got into season five the butterfly effect had kicked in and the show had gotten a little further away from my books and I no longer had adaptations to do I would have had to be working on scenes that never occurred in the books and so forth and at that point I said well it was taking me a month just to do the straight adaptations if it here is gonna take me six weeks minimum maybe two months to write these scripts it's it's too long and David and Anna have done a great job I think I'll step back and just concentrate on the books and that's what I did and and given that divergence how do you now regard what is now the completed sort of corpus of Game of Thrones the HBO series within this broad world of Westeros which you you know you've explored in different directions I mean how where does it fit in well it's it's it's two different ways of telling a story I mean I ask people sometimes how many children Scarlett O'Hara have and for those of you who know gone with the wind anybody you know best-selling most popular movie of all time and a mega bestseller of course in Margaret Mitchell's book Scarlett O'Hara has three children in the movie Scarlett O'Hara has one child which is correct which is right which is true true scholar Tahereh had no children because she didn't exist she was a made-up fictional character so both of them are are equally true you could do it gone with the wind graphic novel next one she could have twelve children that would also be equally true you know where we're making up stories here so yeah I'm telling a version in in my books and the show which had different constraints and different deadlines and different needs has told a very similar story close in some respects exactly the same as some respects different than other respects let's move from the ridiculous to the sublime and stop talking about television start talking about history first of all I want to ask you about the history of the real world and its influence on on your writing of this material about Westeros because you know you spoke earlier on about turning the map of Ireland upside there are very evident sort of influences of medieval history but not only medieval is history on your world tell us a little bit about how that's fed into your vision well I've always loved history back in when I was in college I was a journalism major history was my minor and even before college I loved reading histories popular histories and historical fiction I have thought about the writing historical fiction from time to time about certain periods that I loved but you know the problem about writing historical fiction is you have to pull this damn research and yes you're stuck with the with the history the way it actually happens mostly unless your name is like Quentin Tarantino and you can you can make up an end of inglorious basterds that's completely different from what the audience expects but for the most part you are you're stuck I like the freedom of you know modeling my books on history taking taking influences from history but in fantasy I can make it come out differently I can you know I can make it take a left turn when everybody is expecting it to take a right I can do the unexpected and and the revelation and I can make it bigger I like to say I take things in history and I turn them up to 11 and honey you know your spinal to happen you know you always have to turn it up to 11 or 227 in the case so in 1981 at least a Tuttle and I my first visit to the UK I was visiting my friend Lisa Tuttle with whom I wrote wind Haven and we took a car and we drove around for a while one place we stopped was Hadrian's Wall had amazing influence on me we got there just as sunset most of the tour bus had left we pretty well had it to herself and I went up on the wall and stood there and looked off to the north and tried to imagine I was a Roman legionary you know in the first century standing on the wall and wondering what was going to come out of that hills and you know they thought it was the end of the world now of course I know being a 20th century at the time of our and that what would come out of the hills would actually be Scotsman but I thought that could be a more terrifying answer and but that that moment always stuck with me and many years later when I'm writing what became Game of Thrones and I wanted a wall I earned it up way past Adrian's and made it 700 feet high and made out of ice and the things coming out of the the forest the nails or North were a good deal scary and that's something you can do with with fantasy every time that a season of Game of Thrones would be about to come on television in the UK someone from a newspaper would ring me up and say hey can you we've got this great idea can you write an essay about how Game of Thrones is really just the Wars of the Roses and I'd say yeah sure pay me and I'll of course there's a second secondary industry and george RR martin material and i'm part of it um it's not is I mean that clearly Stark and Lannister York and Lancaster I mean that there are all of these how how much was it drawn from the Wars of the Roses how much was that sort of just convenient material for you to suck into this with this world well there were certainly an inspiration and probably the worst of roses of a single greatest historical inspiration but I'd read a lot of popular history I also bred you know the history of the Crusades and and the Albert jinseyun crusade and the Hundred Years War and of course a lot of Nigel Tranter books about the the historical fiction about the history of Scotland which always end badly the history of Scotland is singularly bloody if you think Game of Thrones is violent read some Scottish history history for the red wedding of course yes the red wedding was loosely based on the the black dinner as they called it but of course once again I turned it up to 11 and then David and Dan got hold of it for a TV show and turned it up to 14 so you know you could always turn it up a little more we've got the red so the the black dinner though is an interesting case I mean I I say I love history but I always want to make it clear that I'm a professional historian and the histories that I read and histories that I love or I guess what are called popular histories they're not academic histories if you accidentally stumble on an academic history it'll probably put you to sleep very quickly the stuff that the professional historians do now the black dinner of Scotland I don't know how many of you know that was the there was a emnity between the the Earl of Douglas the black Douglas as he was called and the King of Scotland so he invited the Earl of Douglas giving it gave him a safe passage to come to the castle and discuss it and they had all day a lovely dinner the Earl who was young there was only like 18 19 years old and he brought his even younger brother who was like 15 years old with him and they had a lovely dinner with the King of Scotland and then at the end of it they started playing this very sonorous beat and some servants entered with a covered platter underneath which was a black Boar's Head which was a symbol of death and so then they took the Earl and his little 1415 year old brother out and they beheaded both of them in New York it's a great story and I went from that and I constructed the the red wedding of course that's the story in myth and in popular legend but but then if you read an academic historian I said none of that ever happened no they did execute the Earl and all that but there was no sonorous beat there was no there was no black Boar's Head all that stuff was invented later and maybe it was but whoever invented it was a pretty good storyteller because I like the popular version of it much better than like the boring academic version of it I think sometimes in the study of history there must be someone maybe it said he's at Harvard or Yale or at Oxford or Cambridge over here and he I don't know what his name is but he his job is to sit in an office and go over history and make it as boring as possible take out take out all the fun bits and and the colorful bits and make it really dull there's a question here from Laura and via Twitter which which sort of connects to this she says a lot of your female characters are very empowered and motivated which other fictional or historical female characters did you draw inspiration from if any uh well again there was a lot of them eleanor of aquitaine of course was was a major one she was one of the most kick-ass women of of the Middle Ages and you know she had her own crusade or she went on crusade rather and she married two kings and then was the father of several or was the mother of several more she was a great character there's also a lot of the if you read the Italian history a lot of the during the Italian Middle Ages and and Renaissance period there were a lot of very powerful and bloody women who controlled various city-states in Italy and and did some amazing things there's one very famous story that again is probably made up by some popular historian or legend maker because it occurs in like the same story is told of like six different men and at least two different women and it's the one where they that the father and or mother is in a castle and they have a son outside who they're going to hang you know surrender to castle though we're gonna hang your son right in front of you and this story is told of William Marshall the great Knights father you know who supposedly pulled up his his jerkin or whatever the hell he was wearing and show them his dick and and said go ahead hang him I have the equipment to make more and that same story is also told of I think Catherine's sabor zone if the Italians where you know they were gonna hang her son and she lifted up her skirts and pointed at her vagina so no I can make another ones you right here so probably it never happened at all since it's attached to six people but God it's a great story I can't resist things like that and then don't be surprised if I steal it and you see it no later game with notebook let's talk about the history of Westeros because this is your latest book it's and you know as I said at the beginning it's a masterpiece of popular history and you can tell how steeped you are in the form because of the the way you've constructed this book tell us why you chose to do this pulling together earlier writings I think on someone quite substantial on the history of Westeros why put this together now well you know as I was writing the books I would I would have people think about or refer to things that happened in history occasionally from time to time and it's actually in the novels references to dead kings references to legendary Knights and so forth of the past at a certain point my publishers said we want to publish a concordance we want to publish a world book because you've got all this history in that and again I was to the middle writing novels I said you know it's a great idea I'd love it to test I wanted heavily Illustrated I want lots of gorgeous fantasy on it and I'd love Ella straited books I always has since I was a kid reading you know Robin Hood and King Arthur books illustrated by people like Howard Pyle and and C Wyeth gorgeous gorgeous books I cut my teeth on those so I wanted my books done the same way so and I said and and you know I have I have little bits of history in my head that I haven't had an opportunity to put in the books yet it put in the novels yet but I'll include them too as there's sidebars so we hired Elio Garcia and Linda and Thompson who are two of my Boober fans they run the Westeros website which is the oldest and the biggest of the websites devoted to Westeros as a book and they were supposed to organize all the historical references that were already in the novels assemble everything and you know write a rough account of it and then I would go in and I would polish that rough account and then I would put it in these side bars which were material that had never appeared so we were supposed to have 50,000 words of prose and then the rest would be art or on every page gorgeous art so by the time elio and Linda had assembled everything we already had seventy thousand words of prose and then I wrote three hundred and fifty thousand words of sidebars my publicist said wait wait we can't we can't do this it's this there won't be art at every page we've already spent the whole art budget they'll be art every 20 pages so we ripped out on my sidebars and you know we got the book together it was published a few years ago the world of Ice and Fire very nice book but then I had all these leftover sidebars that were kind of a history of various Targaryen Kings and I could have written more I was only like halfway through writing the sidebars when when I realized how long they were so at a certain point when we realized that Game of Thrones the TV show was winding down but there might be successful TV shows I said to my publisher as well we want to we always been talking about doing this history book which I was calling the Grimm marillion as a play on token should I finish wins first or should I because the groomer early on is almost complete at least up to Aegon the Regency of Aegon the third and it includes material in it that is going to be the basis of some of these successor shows so maybe we should get out first before the shows and they agreed so they said yeah that finish that one and and then go back to winds of winter so I sat down to finish that when I polished all of the material I'd written I expanded a few of the sidebars but then I had to write you know that there was particularly King Joe Harris the first Joe Harris the conciliator I'd kind of skipped over him in the sidebars because he was the old king he reigned for fifty five years and I just sort of written 55 years of peace and prosperity and that was the big hole in this book and I said well I can't just have two sentences on your hair as he ran for 55 years 55 years of peace and prosperity is pretty dull though there must have been something that happened during that and I started inventing all the things that happened during Joe Harris's rain all of his children were men who were trouble in many different ways and conspiracies and you know the roughness when he first took things and what I loved it and I finished all that and I finally got the whole book done too through the Regency of Aegon the third and I'm very pleased with it I it's it's different I know many of you are getting a copy here as while you were here it's it's not a conventional novel it is imaginary history written in the style I'd you've probably read my real influence on this was Thomas because stains for volume history the Plantagenet switch any of you have not read you know go out and find a copy in the used bookstore it's it's wonderfully written it's full of great great stories most of which academic historians have probably disproved by now but they're still terrific stories and and the Plantagenet for a family that was equally interesting as to the Targaryen they lacked only dragons otherwise otherwise they would be right up there so that was my influence and I tried to do that in this imagined history book it's Costin is the second best book ever written about the Plantagenet essentially there are some great scenes at aiming Aegon's conquest at the beginning of this book as I would I be right in saying you know a sort of you know a version of the Norman conquest of England of 1066 but on dragon back with Dragon Age on the first arriving on balerion the dread I mean it is just amazing is this can I ask one one of the HBO shows and development can you tell us about any of those by the way Blood Moon is ramped something hey I I can't go on it's probably an HBO agent in the in the auditorium even now I can say as I have said before we we started out with a number of different ideas all of them prequels one show which I've been calling the long night what HBO keeps saying it's not titled yet so the show that's not called the long night yet has just finished filming up in Belfast and is now and and other places not just Belfast Italy as well and Jane Goldman is the writer and the showrunner on that you you've probably been familiar with her work she was the scriptwriter on several of the x-men movies she did kick-ass and she did the Kingsmen of Kingsman things she she scripted Neil Gaiman's Stardust so she's very experienced screenwriter and she's done this story and it is set you know five thousand years in the past of Westeros so way way way before the events of Game of Thrones and that that's the one that is furthest along at the moment and it's in pre-production and right now it's just a pilot but it's got Naomi Watts in it starring it's got miranda Richardson a lot of other very exciting actors and will probably be finally added in the next couple months whether HBO was actually gonna order for the full series of that and meanwhile we have two other pilots that are also in active development at some stage and hopefully in the near future one or both of them will be greenlit to shoot a pilot and we may get more than one westeros show on the air Wow and do you have any particularly particularly at characters or episodes within this I mean the dance of the Dragons of course it sort of forms of in a sense a core part of the book well I have I have a lot of affection from mushroom well say a little bit about mushroom and send and link it if you wouldn't mind to the process of writing fake history because this is something that really struck me that you've done so skillfully with this book explaining mushroom is maybe well mushroom is a dwarf and but he's not a well born one like Tyrion he's he's a dwarf of lowly birth who's the the fool at in the court during the events leading up to and during much of the dance of the Dragons and it's aftermath he's a jester they were actually a number of jesters in the real Middle Ages of course you've probably seen them in many movies fools gestures as they were called some of them were very very clever men who were who could do all sorts of wit witticisms and and jokes who could sing funny songs who could juggle and ride unicycles and do other colorful things some of them were people who were physically deformed who were word Dwarfs or hunchbacks or whatever and some of them were obviously very politically incorrect these days but some of them were mentally handicapped mentally [ __ ] the people of the Middle Ages found that wonderfully amusing so mushroom is is a dwarf but he's of the clever sorties and and he's an observer and he the testimony of mushroom this is this folks not actually written by me you see it's written by archmaester Gill Dean of the Citadel and he's writing a history and like anyone writing in history he has to go back to primary sources and I had a lot of fun with that because when he gets to the dance of dragons he has a number of primary sources but three of them are most major he has he has Grand Master or wilds official court records he has the Septon who was kept the Septon in King's Landing and the red cape who of course is a is a religious figure so he interprets everything as the will of the gods and what was the sand and what wasn't the same and he has mushroom who was semi-literate and could actually write anything but who told his story in later years to to a equivalent of a monk who wrote it all down and mushroom story of course is always the most scandalous Gorillaz filthy version of events all of which had to do with people betraying each other and poisoning each other and having similar type fun and sleeping in places station and sleep and all of that I love the idea since this was a fake history I didn't want to tell it as a omniscient historian sitting down this is what actually happened I love the idea of telling it as a historian in world who's trying to figure out what happened but he's looking better his primary sources and he's finding contradictory accounts you know and this was impressed on me many many years ago long before Game of Thrones began I was I was writing a novel that was never completed or published it was black and white and red all vermin novel about 1890s journalism in New York City when there were fourteen competing daily newspapers one of which was the New York world owned and operated by Joseph Pulitzer it's a great great journalist for whom the Pulitzer Prize is named and the New York world building which no longer exists but was down on Park Row which is where all the newspapers who were built was the tallest building in the world at its time and it had a golden dome on the top it was a very memorable building you know it was built right next to the Sun a competing paper but it was so high that people said pull it could could lean out and spit the Sun if you wanted to spit straight down at the smaller building next one the thing is when I tried to research the world and find out tallest building in the world how many stories was it exactly I found three different contradictory citations it was easy is 20 stories tall or 16 I think were 15 and that really impressed on me this is like 1890 I'm looking at this is like yesterday incomparable things this is a simple factual question how many stories were in this building and I'm getting three different accounts if they can't even get that right what's the odds that they know what happened to Charlemagne you know 2,000 years ago or something the answer astronomical so modern historian or something like archmaester gilding has to sort through these stories these contradictory stories and decide which he believes in which he doesn't believe and I had a lot of fun being able to tell you know mushrooms accounts which are probably all turned up to 37 and then the dollar accounts but I didn't have to just stick to the Builder accounts I could give all three and that was a great deal of fun and gilding sort of favor phrase that he comes back to is I guess we'll never know after after presenting every version of the story and in this beautiful piece of Peruvians but that kind of buttoned up surely when you're reading your actual histories you would encounter the same problems exactly the same thing so you do the same thing you know you tell the obviously phony version they go but that's probably phony but by that time you've got the bit about the red-hot poker up the arse or make your own mind up guys and one more question here submitted from an audience member aurelie Percy I think is the name the second volume of fire and blood won't come out anytime soon so very pessimistic about your output maybe maybe with some justification but could you could you give us an idea of some elements that it will contain we go up to the reign of Aegon the unlucky here what at one of the highlights of the putative next volume of this well I mean that I act I this book on he goes up to the Regency of Aegon and ends when Aegon the third actually reaches mandarin takes control so i have his reign to cover which includes the death of the last dragons although Aegon the third is called the dragon bane there are still three or four dragons kicking around when he takes the crown and there were none by the time he's over so that one thing I was going to cover why and what happens there and some of the troubles and rebellions of his reign and then ultimately his children who are fairly interesting I mean he has ultimately five one of whom is there on the first a young dragon who conquers Dorne and he's a 14 year old Alexander the great kind of hero king figure but he dies young and then his his brother Bay Lord takes over and Baylor is very religious very he's a more of a st. Louis kind of figure little extreme and his religiosity and among other things he imprisons his three sisters in luxurious imprisonment and the red keep the maiden volt but he doesn't like them like walking around court because they tempt him with you know they have breasts and things underneath their clothes and he finds that very disturbing to contemplate so he hides them away so I'll tell their stories and I'll tell Baylor story and then after him well we get a brief a brief reign of Viserys the second and then the serious son Aegon the fourth Aegon the unworthy takes over and he's a very colorful figure himself I obviously drew on Henry the eighth for him you know Henry the Eighth had six wives Aegon the unworthy had nine mistresses and they're all existed my head I know who they all were and what happened to each of them and who was where their head chopped off and who you know had affairs and who did what so there's a lot of cool material that and then you get into the Blackfyre rebellion which were five I've referred to them frequently so I'll get all the details on the Blackfyre rebellion z' and ultimately we'll get up to the the Mad King and Robert's rebellion and Wow that's where I'll draw to a close but when am I going to write it well I got to finish winds of winter first and then probably a dunk an egg and then yeah I don't know I don't know I need I need more hours in the day and I need to be 20 years younger and all of that but um you tell you you could only write one word at a time so that's what I'm doing well George fittingly perhaps we're running late and I I want to carry on but I can feel eyes I mean and I've got I do have one more question for you which is in this book we have many many dragons and many many Valyrian steel swords and if you could have if you could ride one dragon and wield one sword which would it be well if I could write on one dragon I might as well go with the biggest which would be balerion the black dread he's used to mega dragon in in this early book he's the the only one that remembers of valaria past a certain point as he was brought over from malaria at a little before the doom of Valyria and he's the biggest and meanest of the dragons that exists if I could wield only one sword I don't think it would be any of the Targaryen swords it would be dawn the swords the sword wielded by the sword of the morning the air of house Dayne of Starfall which is made from the metal from a fallen star and who knows what magical property is full on storms bring to earth well I think you've got a bit of falling star in you now ladies and gentlemen we are I'm afraid we're out of time so we've arranged for balerion the black dread to take George after dinner so George is very shortly going to leave the stage I'm going to ask all of you not to leave your seats just for a moment because otherwise balerion is gonna eat you and wait til we've gone is what I'm saying I'm very sorry we have to go but it has been I think you'll all agree an enormous privilege and an utter joy and a pleasure to have with us the one and only george RR martin [Applause] [Music] you [Music]
