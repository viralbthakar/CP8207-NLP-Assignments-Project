 fire and blood chapter 17 the dying of the dragons rhaenyra overthrown back in king's landing queen rhaenyra was finding herself ever more isolated with every new betrayal the suspected turncloak adam velaryon had fled before he could be put to the question his flight had proved his guilt the white worm murmured lord kaltigar concurred and proposed a punishing new tax on any child born out of wedlock such attacks would not only replenish the crown's coffers but might also rid the realm of thousands of bastards her grace had more pressing concerns than her treasury however by ordering the arrest of adam velaryon she had lost not only a dragon and a dragon rider but her queen's hand as well and more than half the army that had sailed from dragonstone to seize the iron throne was made up of men sworn to house velaryon when it became known that lord corliss languished in a dungeon under the red keep they began to abandon her caused by the hundreds some made their way to the cobbler square to join the throngs gathered around the shepherd whilst others slipped through postern gates or over the walls intent on making the way back to driftmark nor could those who remain be trusted that was proved when two of the sea snakes sworn swords sir dennis woodright and sir thor and true cut their way into the dungeons to free their lord their plans were betrayed to lady misery by a horse or thorin had been betting and the would-be rescuers were taken and hanged the two knights died at dawn kicking and writhing against the walls of the red keep as the nooses tightened round their necks that very day not long after sunset another horror visited the queen's court helena targaryen sister wife and queen to king aegon ii and mother of his children threw herself from her window in maegor's holdfast to die impaled upon the iron spikes that lined the dry moat below she was but one and twenty after half a year of captivity why should aegin's queen choose this night to end her life mushroom asserts that helena was with child after her days and nights of being sold for a common horror but this explanation is only as creditable as his tale of the brothel queens which is to say not credible at all grand maester munken believes the horror of seeing sir thorin and sir dennis died drove her to the act but if the young queen knew the two men it could only have been his jailers and there is no evidence that she was a witness to their hanging septon used to suggest that lady massaria the white worm chose this night to tell helena of the death of her son maylor and the grisly manner of his passing through what motive she would have had for doing so beyond simple malice is hard to fathom maesters may argue about the truth of such assertions but on that faithful night a darker tale was being told in the streets and alleys of king's landing in inns and brothels and pot shops even holy seps queen elena had been murdered the whispers went as her sons had been before her prince darren and his dragons would soon be at the gates and with them the end of rhaenyra's reign the old queen was determined that her young half-sister would not live to revel in her downfall so she had sent sir luther largent to seize helena with his huge rough hands and fling her from the window onto the spikes below whence came this poisonous calumny one might ask for a county it most certainly is grand mr munkin places it at the door of the shepherd for thousands heard him decry both crime and queen but did he originate the lie or was he merely giving echo to words heard from other lips the latter mushroom would have us believe a slander so vile could only have been the work of larry strong the dwarf asserts for the clubfoot had never left king's landing as would soon be revealed but only slipped into its shadows from whence he continued to plot and whisper could helena's death have been murder possibly but it seems unlikely queen rhaenyra was behind it helena targaryen was a broken creature who posed no threat to her grace nor do our sources speak to any special entity between them if rhaenyra were intent on murder surely it would have been the double go queen allison flung down into the spikes moreover at the time between helena's death we have abundant proof that sir luther largent the purported killer was eating with 300 of his gold cloaks at the barracks by the gate of the gods all the same the rumor of queen helena's murder was soon on the lips of half of king's landing that it was so quickly believed shows how utterly the city had turned against their once beloved queen rhaenyra was hated helena had been loved nor had the common folk of the city forgotten the cruel murder of prince giharris by blood and cheese and the terrible death of prince maylor at bitter bridge helena's end had been mercifully swift one of the spikes took her through the throat and she died without a sound at the moment of her death across the city atop the hill of rhaenys her dragon dream fire rose suddenly with a roar that shook the dragon pit snapping two of the chains that bound her when dowager queen alicent was informed of her daughter's passing she rent her garments and pronounced a dire curse upon her rival that night king's landing rose in bloody riot the rioting began amidst the alleys and winds of flea bottom as man and woman poured from the wine sinks rat pits and pot shops by the hundreds angry drunken and afraid from there the rioters spread throughout the city shouting for justice for the dead princes and their murdered mother carts and wagons were overturned shops looted homes plundered and set a fire gold cloaks attempting to quell the disturbances were set upon and beaten bloody no one was spared of high birth or low lords were pelted with rubbish knights pulled from their saddles lady darla dedeg saw her brother davos stabbed through the eye when he tried to defend her from three drunken osslers and 10 on raping her sailors unable to return to their ships attacked the river gate and fought a pitch battle with the city watch it took sir luther largent and 400 spears to disperse them by then the gate had been hacked half to pieces and a hundred men were dead or dying a quarter of them gold cloaks no such rescuers came for lord bartimos keltegar whose walled mance was defended only by six guardsmen and a few hastily armed servants when rioters came swarming over the walls these dubious defenders threw down their weapons and ran or joined the attackers arthur keltegar a boy of 15 made a brave stand in a doorway sword in hand and kept the howling mob at bay for a few moments until a treacherous serving girl let the riders in through a back way the brave lad was slain by a spear thrust through the back lord bartimos himself fought his way to the stables only to find all his horses dead or stolen taken the queen's despised master of coin was bound to a post and tortured until he revealed where all his wealth was hidden then a tanner called watt announced that his lordship had failed to pay his [ __ ] tax and must yield his manhood to the crown as forfeit at cobbler square the sounds of the riot could be heard from every quarter the shepherd drank deep of the anger proclaiming that the day of doom was nigh at hand just as he had foretold and calling down the wrath of the gods this unnatural queen who sits bleeding on the iron throne her [ __ ] lips glistening and red with blood of her sweet sister when a septa in the crowd cried out pleading for him to save the city the shepherd said only the mother's mercy can save you but you drove your mother from this city with your pride and lust and avarice now it is the stranger who comes on a dark horse with burning eyes he comes a scourge of fire in his hand to cleanse this pit of sin of demons and all who bow before them listen can you hear the sound of the burning hooves he comes he comes the crowd took up the crying wailing he comes he comes as a thousand torches filled the square with pools of smoky yellow light soon enough the shouts died away and through the night the sound of iron hooves and the cobblestones grew louder not one stranger about 500. mushroom says in his testimony the city watch had come in strength 500 men clad in black ring mail steel caps and long golden cloaks armed with short swords spears and spike cudgels they formed up on the south side of the square behind a wall of shields and spears at their head rode sir luther largent upon an armored war horse a longsword in his hand the mere sight of him was enough to send hundreds streaming away into the winds and alleys and side streets hundreds more fled when sir luthor ordered the gold cloaks to advance ten thousand remained however the press was so thick that many who might have gladly fled found themselves unable to move pushed and shoved and trot upon others surged forward locked arms and began to shout and curse as the spears advanced to the slow beat of a drum my way you bloody fools sir luthor roared at the shepherd's lambs go home no harm will come to you go home we only want this shepherd some say the first man to die was a baker who grunted in surprise when a spear point pierced his flesh and he saw his apron turning red others claim it was a little girl trodden under by sir luthor's war horse a rock came flying from the crowd striking a spearman on the brow shouts and curses were heard sticks and stones and chamber pots came raining down from rooftops in archer across the square began to lose his shafts a torch was thrust at a watchman and quick as that his golden cloak was burning on the far side of cobbler's square the shepherd was bundled away by his accolades stop him sir luthor shouted seize him stop him he spurred his horse cutting his way through the throng and his goal cloaks followed discarding their spears to draw swords and cudgels the shepherd's followers were screaming falling running others produced weapons of their own dirks and daggers malls and clubs broken spears and rusted swords the gold cloaks were large men young strong disciplined well armed and well armored for 20 yards or more their shield wall held and they cut a bloody road through the crowd leaving dead and dying all around them but they numbered only 500 and 10 000 had gathered to hear the shepherd one watchman went down then another suddenly small folk were slipping through the gaps in the line screaming curses the shepherd's flock attacked with knives and stones even teeth swarming over the city watch and around their flanks attacking from behind flinging tiles down from the roofs and balconies battle turned to riot turned to slaughter surrounded on all sides the gold cloaks found themselves hemmed in and swept under with no room to wield their weapons many died on the points of their own swords others were torn to pieces kicked to death trampled underfoot hacked apart with hoes and butcher's cleavers even the fearsome sir luther largen could not escape the carnage his sword torn from his grasp largent was pulled from his saddle stabbed in the belly and bludgeoned to death with a cobblestone his helm and head so crushed that it was only by its size that his body was recognizable when the corpse wagons came the next day during that long night septon eustis tells us the shepherd held sway over half the city while strange lords and kings of misrules squabbled over the rest hundreds of men gathered around watt the tanner who rode through the streets on a white horse brandishing lord kaltigar's severed head and bloody genitals declaring an end to all taxes in a brothel on the street of silk the horrors raised up their own king a pale-haired boy of four named gaiman supposedly a bastard of the missing king aegon ii not to be outdone a hedge knight named sir perkin the flea crowned his own squire tristain a stripping of 16 years old declaring him to be a natural-born son of the late king viserys any knight can make a night and when sir perkin began dubbing every cell sword thief and butcher's boy who flocked tristain's ragged banner men and boys appeared by the hundreds to pledge themselves to his cause by dawn fires were burning throughout the city cobbler square was littered with corpses and bands of lawless men roamed flea bottom breaking into shops and homes and laying rough hands on every honest person they encountered the surviving gold cloaks had retreated to the barracks whilst gutter knights mummer kings and mad prophets ruled the streets like the roaches they resembled the worst of these fled before the light retreating to hidey holes and sellers to sleep off their drunks divvy up their plunder and wash the blood off their hands the goal cloaks at the old gate and the dragon gate sallied forth under the command of their captains sir baylon birch and sir garth the hair lip and by midday had managed to restore some semblance of order to the streets north and east of rainey's hill sir medrick manderly leading a hundred white harbor men did the same for the area northeast of higgins high hill down to the iron gate the rest of king's landing remained in chaos they found fishermonger square and river row swarming with sir perkins gutter knights at the river gate king tristain's ragged banner flew above the battlements whilst the bodies of the captains and three of his sergeants hung from the gatehouse the remainder of the mudfoot garrison had gone over to sir perkin sertaren lost a quarter of his men fighting his way back to the red keep yet escaped lightly compared to so laurent marbrand who led 100 knights and men at arms into flea bottom 16 returned sir laurent lord commander of the queen's guard was not amongst them by evenfall rhaenyra targaryen found herself sore beset on every side her reign in ruins the queen wept when they told her house or laurent died mushroom testifies but she raged when she learned that maidenpool had gone over to the foe that the girl nettles had escaped that her own beloved consort had betrayed her and she trembled when lady myssaria warned her against the coming dark that this night would soon be worse than the last at dawn a hundred men attended her in the throne room but one by one they slipped away or were dismissed until only her sons and i remained with her my faithful mushroom her grace called me with that old man worse choose you i shall make you my hand when i replied that i would sooner be her consort she laughed no sound was ever sweeter it was good to hear her laugh munken's true telling says not of the queen laughing only that her grace swung from rage to despair and back again clutching so desperately at the iron throne that both her hands were bloody by the time the sun set she gave command to the gold cloaks to sir baylon birch captain at the iron gate sent ravens to winterfell and the erie pleading for more aid ordered that a decree of a tanger be drawn up against the mutants of maidenpool and named the young sir glendon good lord commander of the queen's guard though only 20 and a member of the white swords for less than a moon's turn good had distinguished himself during the fighting in fleabottom earlier that day it was he who brought back sir lawrence body to keep the rioters from despoiling it though the full mushroom does not figure in septon eustis's account the last day nor in monken's true telling both speak of the queen's sons again the younger was ever at his mother's side yet seldom spoke a word prince joffrey 10 and 3 don squire's armor and begged the queen to let him ride to the dragonpit and mount tyraxis i want to fight for you mother as my brothers did let me prove that i am as brave as they were his words only deepened rhaenyra's resolve however brave they were and dead they are the both of them my sweet boys and once more her grace forbade the prince to leave the castle with the setting of the sun the vermin of king's landing emerged once more from the rat pits hidey holes and cellars in even greater numbers than the night before on visenya's hill an army of [ __ ] bestowed their favors freely on any man willing to swear his sword to gaiman pal-hair king connie in the volgor parlance of the city at the river gate sir perkin feasted his gutter knights on stolen food and led them down the riverfront looting horves and warehouses in any ship that had not been put to sea even as watt the tanner led his own mob of howling ruffians against the gate of the gods though king's landing boasted massive walls and stout towers they had been designed to repel attacks from the outside the city not from within its own walls the garrison at the gate of the gods was especially weak as their captain and a third of their number had died with sir luther largent in cobbler square those who remained many wounded were easily overcome watt's followers poured out into the countryside streaming up the kingsguard behind lord caltigar's rotting head toward where not even wad seemed certain before an hour had passed the king's gate and the lion gate were open as well the gold cloaks at the first had fled whilst the lions at the other had thrown in with the mobs three of the seven gates of king's landing were open to rhaenyra's foes the most dire threat to the queen's rule proved to be within the city however at nightfall the shepherd had appeared once more to resume his preaching in cobbler square the corpses from last night's fighting have been cleared away during the day we are told but not before they had been looted of their clothes and coin and other valuables and in some cases of their heads as well as the one-handed prophet shrieked his curses at the vile queen and the red keep a hundred severed heads looked up at him swaying atop tall spears and sharpened staffs the crowd septon eustis says was twice as large and thrice as fearful as the night before like the queen they so despised the shepherd's lambs were looking to the sky with dread fearing that king aegon's dragons would arrive before the night was out with an army close behind him no longer believing that the queen could protect them they looked to their shepherd for salvation but that prophet answered when the dragons come your flesh will burn and blister and turn to ash your wives will dance in gowns of fire shrieking as they burn lewd and naked underneath the flames and you shall see your little children weeping weeping till their eyes do melt and slide like jelly down their faces till their pink flesh falls black and crackling from their bones the stranger comes he comes he comes to scourge us for our sins prayers cannot stay his wrath no more than tears can quench the flame of dragons only blood can do that your blood my blood their blood then he raised his right arm and jabbed the stump of his missing hand at rainey's hill behind him at the dragon pit black against the stars there the demons dwell up there fire and blood blood and fire this is their city if you would make it yours first you must destroy them if you would cleanse yourself of sin first must you bathe in dragon's blood for only blood can quench the fires of hell from ten thousand throats a cry went up kill them kill them and like some vast beast with ten thousand legs the lambs began to move shoving and pushing waving their torches brandishing swords and knives and other cruder weapons walking and running through the streets and alleys toward the dragon pit some thought better and slipped away to home but for every man who left three more appeared to join these dragon slayers by the time they reached the hill of rainey's their numbers had doubled high atop aegin's high hill across the city mushroom watched the attack unfold from the roof of maegor's holdfast with the queen her sons and members of her court the night was black and overcast the torches were so numerous that it was as if all the stars had come down from the sky to storm the dragonpit the fool says as soon as word had reached her that the shepherd's savage flock was on the march rhaenyra sent riders to surbalan at the old gate and sir garth at the dragon gate commanding them to disperse the lambs seize the shepherd and defend the royal dragons but with the city in such turmoil it was far from certain that the riders had won through even if they had what loyal gold cloaks remained were too few to have any hope of success her grace had as well commanded them to halt the black water in its flow says mushroom when prince joffrey pleaded with his mother to let him ride forth with her own knights and those from white harbor the queen refused if they take that hill this one will be next she said we will need every sword here to defend the castle they will kill the dragons prince joffrey said anguished or the dragons will kill them his mother said unmoved let them burn the realm would not long miss them mother what if they kill tyraxes the young prince said the queen did not believe it they are vermin drunks and fools and gutter rats one taste of dragon flame and they will run at that the full mushrooms spoke up saying drunks they may be but a drunken man knows not fear fool's eye but a fool can kill a king rats that too but a thousand rats can bring down a bear i saw it happen once down there in flea bottom this time queen rhaenyra did not laugh bidding her fool to hold his tongue or lose it her grace turned back to the parapets only mushrooms saw prince joffrey go sulking off if his testimony can be believed and mushroom had been told to hold his tongue it was only when the watchers on the roof heard cyrax roar that the prince's absence was noted that was too late no the queen was heard to say i forbid it i forbid it but even as she spoke her dragon flapped up from the yard perched for a half a heartbeat atop the castle battlements then launched herself into the night with the queen's son clinging to her back a sword in hand after him rhaenyra shouted all of you every man every boy to horse to horse go after him bring him back bring him back he does not know my son my sweet my son seven men did ride down from the red keep that night into the madness of the city munkin tells us they were men of honor duty-bound to obey their queen's commands septon eustis would have us believe that their hearts had been touched by a mother's love for her son mushroom names them dolts and dastards eager for some rich reward and too dull to believe they might die for once it may be that all three of our chroniclers have the truth of it at least in part our septon our maester and our fool do agree upon their names the seven who rode sir medric manderly the heir to white harbor sir lorth lansdale and sir harold drake knights of the queensguard sir harmon of the reeds called ironbanger sergile's ironwood an exiled knight from dorne sir william royce armed with the famed valyrian sword lamentation and sir glendon good lord commander of the queen's guard six squires eight gold cloaks and 20 minute arms rode with the seven champions as well but their names alas have not come down to us many a singer has made many a song of the ride of the seven and many a tale has been told of the perils they face as they fought their way across the city whilst king's landing burned around them and the alleys of flea bottom ran red with blood certain of those songs even have some truth to them but it is beyond our purview to recount them here songs are sung of prince joffrey's last flight as well some singers can find glory even in a privy mushroom tells us but it takes a fool to speak the truth though we cannot doubt the prince's courage his act was one of folly we shall not pretend to any understanding of the bond between dragon and dragon rider wiser heads have pondered that mystery for centuries we do know however that dragons are not horses to be ridden by any man who throws a saddle on their back cyrax was the queen's dragon she had never known another rider though prince joffrey was known to her by sight and scent a familiar presence whose fumbling at her chains excited no alarm the great yellow she-dragon wanted no part of him astride her in his haste to be away before he could be stopped the prince had vaulted onto cyrax without benefit of saddle or whip his intent we must presume was either to fly cyrax into battle or more likely to cross the city to the dragonpit and his own tyraxes mayhaps he meant to loose the other pit dragons as well joffrey never reached the hill of rhaenys once in the air cyrax twisted beneath him fighting to be free of this unfamiliar rider and from below stones and spears and arrows flew at him from the hands of the shepherd's blood-soaked lambs maddening the dragon even further 200 feet above flea bottom prince joffrey slid from the dragon's back and plunged to the earth near a juncture where five alleys came together the prince's fall came to its bloody end he crashed first onto a steep pitched roof before rolling off to fall another 40 feet amidst a shower of broken tiles we are told that the fall broke his back that shards of slate rained down upon him like knives that his own sword tore loose of his hand and pierced him through the belly in flea bottom the men still speak of a candlemaker's daughter named robin who cradled the broken prince in her arms and gave him comfort as he died but there is more legend than of history in that tale mother forgive me joffrey supposedly said with his last breath though men still argue whether he was speaking of his mother the queen or praying to the mother above thus parish joffrey velaryon prince of dragonstone and heir to the iron throne the last of queen rhaenyra's sons by lenore velaryon or the last of her bastards by sir harwin strong depending on which truth one chooses to believe the mob was not long in falling on his corpse the candle maker's daughter robin if she ever existed was driven off looters tore the boots from the prince's feet and the sword from his belly then stripped him of his fine blood-stained clothes others still more savage began ripping at his body both of his hands were cut off so the scum of the streets might claim the rings on his fingers the prince's right foot was hacked through at the angle and a butcher's apprentice was sawing at his neck to claim his head when the seven who rode came thundering up there amidst the stinks of fleabottom a battle was waged in the mud and blood for possession of prince joffrey's body the queen's knights at last reclaimed the boy's remains save for his missing foot though three of the seven fell in the fighting the dornishmen sergile's ironwood was pulled from his horse and bludgeoned to death while sir william royce was felled by a man who leapt down from a rooftop to land upon his back his famed sword lamentation was torn from his hand and carried off never to be found again most grievous of all was the fate of sir glendon goode attacked from behind by a man with a torch who set his long white cloak of fire as the flames licked at his back his horse reared in terror and threw him and the mob swarmed over him tearing him to pieces only 20 years of age sir glendon had been lord commander of the queen's guard for less than a day and even as blood flowed in the alleys of flea bottom another battle raged around the dragonpit above atop the hill of rainey's mushroom was not wrong swarms of starving rats do indeed bring down bulls and bears and lions when there are enough of them no matter how many the bull or bear might kill there are always more biting at the great beast's legs clinging to its belly running up its back the shepherd's rats were armed with spears long axes spiked clubs and half a hundred other kinds of weapons including both longbows and crossbows gold cloaks from the dragon gate obedient to the queen's command issued forth from their barracks to defend the hill but found themselves unable to cut through the mobs and turned back whilst the messenger sent to the old gate never arrived the dragon pit had its own contingent of guards the dragon keepers but those proud warriors were only 7 and 70 in number and fewer than 50 had the watch that night though their swords drank deep the blood of the attackers the numbers were against them when the shepherd's lamb smashed through the doors the towering main gates sheathed in bronze and iron were too strong to assault but the building had a score of lesser entrances and came clamoring through the windows the dragon keepers were overwhelmed and soon slaughtered mayhaps the attackers hoped to take the dragons within whilst they slept but in the clanger of the assault made that impossible those who lived to tell the tales afterwards spoke of shouts and screams the smell of blood in the air the splintering of oak and iron doors beneath crude rams and the blows of countless axes seldom have so many men rushed eagerly onto their funeral pyres grand maestermunken wrote but a madness was upon them there were four dragons housed within the dragonpit by the time the first the attackers came pouring out onto the sands all four were roused awake and angry no two chronicles agree on how many men and women died that night beneath the dragonpit's great dome two hundred or two thousands be that as it may for every man who perished ten suffered burns and yet survived trapped within the pit hemmed in by the walls and dome and bound by heavy chains the dragons could not fly away or use their wings to evade attacks and swoop down on their foes instead they fought with their horns and claws and teeth turning this way and that like bulls in a flea bottom rat pit but these bulls could breathe fire the dragon pit was transformed into a fiery hell where burning men staggered screaming through the smoke the flesh slogging from their blackened bones right septin eustis but for every man who died ten more appeared shouting that the dragons must needs die one by one they did schreikos was the first dragon to succumb slain by a woodsman known as hobb the huer who leapt onto her neck driving his axe down into the beast's skull as shrikos roared and twisted trying to throw him off seven blows did hob deliver with his legs locked around the dragon's neck and each time his axe came down he roared out the name of one of the seven it was the seventh blow the stranger's blow that slewed the dragon crashing through scale and bones into the beast's brain if eustace is to be believed morgal it is written was slain by the burning knight a huge brood of a man in heavy armor who rushed headlong into the dragon's flame with spear in hand thrusting its point into the beast's eye repeatedly even as the dragonflame melted the steel plate that encased him and devoured the flesh within prince joffrey's tyraxis retreated back into his lair we are told roasting so many would-be dragon slayers as they rushed after him that his entrance was soon made impassable by their corpses but it must be recalled that each of these man-made caves had two entrances one fronting onto the sands of the pit the other opening onto the hillside it was the shepherd himself who directed his followers to break through the back door hundreds did howling through the smoke with swords and spears and axes as tyraxis turned his chains fouled entangling him in a web of steel that fatally limited his movement half a dozen men and one woman would later claim to have dealt the dragon the mortal blow like his master tyraxis suffered further in dignity even in death as the shepherd's followers sliced the membranes from his wings and tore them into ragged strips to fashion dragon skin cloaks the last of the four pit dragons did not die so easily legend has it that dream fire had broken free of two of her chains at queen helena's death the remaining bonds she burst now tearing the stanchions from the walls as the mob rushed her then plunging into them with tooth and claw ripping men apart and tearing off their limbs even as she loosed her terrible fires as others closed about her she took wing circling the cavernous interior the dragon pit and swooping down to attack the men below tyraxis schreikos and morgol killed scorers there could be little doubt but dream fires slew more than all three of them combined hundreds fled in terror from her flames but hundreds more drunk or mad or possessed of the warrior's own courage pushed through to the attack even at the apex of the dome the dragon was within easy reach of the archer and crossbowmen and arrows and quarrels flew at dreamfire wherever she went at such close range that some few even punched through her scales whenever she lighted men swarmed to the attack driving her back into the air twice the dragon flew at the dragonpit's great bronze gates only to find them closed and barred and defended by the ranks of spears unable to flee dreamfire returned to the attack savaging her tormentors until the sand of the pit were strewn with charred corpses and the very air was thick with smoke and the smell of burned flesh yet still the spears and arrows flew the end came when a crossbow bolt nicked one of the dragon's eyes half-blind and maddened by a dozen-lesser wound dreamfire spread her wings and flew straight up at the great dome above in a last desperate attempt to break into the open sky already weakened by blasts of dragonflame the dome cracked under the force of impact and a moment later half of it came tumbling down crushing both the dragon and dragon slayers under tons of broken stone and rubble the storming of the dragon pit was done four of the targaryen dragons lay dead though at hideous cost yet the shepherd was not yet triumphant for the queen's own dragon remained alive and free and as burned and bloody survivors of the carnage in the pit came stumbling from the smoking ruins cyrax descended upon them from above mushroom was amongst those watching with queen rhaenyra on the roof of maegor's holdfast a thousand shrieks and shouts echoed across the city mingling with the dragon's roar he tells us atop the hill of rhaenys the dragonpit wore a crown of yellow fire burning so bright it seemed as if the sun was rising even the queen trembled as she watched the tears glistening on her cheeks never have i seen sight more terrible more glorious many of the queen's companions on the rooftop fled the dwarf tells us fearing that the fires would soon engulf the entire city even the red keep atop aegon's high hill others took themselves to the castle sept to pray for deliverance rhaenyra herself wrapped her arms around her last living son egg and the younger clutching him fiercely to her bosom nor would she loose or hold upon him until that dread moment when cyrax fell unchained and riderless cyrax might have easily flown away from the madness the sky was hers she could have returned to the red keep left the city entirely taken wing for dragonstone was it the noise and fire that drew her to the hill of rainey's the roars and screams of the dying dragons the smell of burning flesh we cannot know no more than we can know why cyrax chose to descend upon the shepherd's mobs rending them with tooth and claw and devouring dozens when she might as easily have rained fire on them from above for in the sky no man could have harmed her we can only report what happened as mushroom septon eustace and grand maester monken have set it down for us many a conflicting tale is told of the death of the queen's dragon monken credits hobb the huer and his axe though this is almost certainly mistaken could the same man truly have slain two dragons on the same night and in the same manner some speak of an unnamed spearman a blood-soaked giant who left from the dragonpit's broken dome onto the dragon's back others relate how a knight named sir warwick wheaton slashed a wing from cyrax with a valyrian steel sword lamentation most like a crossbowman named bean would claim the kill afterward boasting of it in many a wine sink and tavern until one of the queen's loyalists grew tired of his wagging tongue and cut it out possibly all the worthies safehop played some role in the dragon's demise but the tale most oft heard in king's landing named the shepherd himself as the dragon slayer as others fled the story went the one-handed prophet stood fearless and alone against the ravening beast calling on the seven for sakura till the warrior himself took form 30 feet tall and in his hand was a black blade made of smoke that turned to steel as he swung it cleaving the head of cyrax from her body and so the tale was told even bicepton eustis in his account of these dark days and so the singer sang for many years thereafter the loss of both her dragon and her son left rhaenyra targaryen ashen and inconsolable mushroom tells us attended only by the fool she retreated to her chambers whilst her counselors conferred king's landing was lost all agreed they must needs abandon the city reluctantly her grace was persuaded to leave the next day at dawn with the mud gate in the hands of her foes and all the ships along the river burned or sunk rhaenyra and a small band of followers slipped out through the dragon gate intending to make their way up the coast to duskendale with her rode the brothers manderly for surviving queensguard surveillan birch and 20 gold cloaks four of the queen's ladies in waiting and her surviving son egan the younger mushroom remained behind along with other members of the court amongst them lady misery and septon eustis sir garth the hairlip captain the gold cloaks at the dragon's gate was charged with the defense of the castle a task for which the harelip proved to have little appetite her grace had not been gone half a day when sir perkin the flea and his gutter knights appeared outside the gates demanding that the castle yield though outnumbered ten to one the queen's garrison might have still resisted but sir garth chose instead to strike rhaenyra's banners open his gates and trust to the mercy of the foe the flea proved to have no mercy garth the harelip was dragged before him and beheaded along with 20 other knights still loyal to the queen amongst them sir harmon of the reeds the iron banger who had been one of the seven who rode noor was the mistress of whisperers lady maisaria of lis spared on account of her sex taken whilst attempting to flee the white worm was whipped naked through the city from the red keep to the gate of the gods if she were still alive by the time they reached the gate she would be spared and allowed to go she made it only half that distance dying on the cobblestones with hardly a patch of her pale white skin left upon her back septon eustis feared for his own life only the mother's mercy saved me he writes though it seems more likely that sir perkin did not wish to provoke the enmity of the faith the flee also freed all the prisoners found in the dudgeons below the castle amongst them grand maester orwell and the sea snake lord coreless velaryon both were on hand the next day to bear witness as sir perkins gangling squire tristain mounted the iron throne so too was the queen dowagar alcente of house hightower down in the black cells sir perkins men even found king aegon's former master of coin sir tylen lannister still alive though rhaenyra's torturers had blinded him pulled out his fingernails and toenails cut off his ears and relieved him of his manhood king aegin's master whispers larry strong the clubfoot fared much better the lord of harrenhal emerged intact from wherever he had been hiding like a man risen from the grave he came striding through the halls of the red keep as if he had never left them to be greeted warmly by sir perk in the flea and take a place of honor at the side of his new king the queen's flight brought no peace to king's landing three kings reigned over the city each on his own hill yet for the unfortunate subjects there was no law no justice no protection says the true telling no man's home was safe nor any maidens virtue this chaos endured for more than a moon's turn maesters and other scholars writing of this time off take their cue from monken and speak of the moon of the three kings other scholars prefer the moon of madness but this is a misnomer as the shepherd never claimed kingship styling himself a simple son of the seven yet it cannot be denied that he held sway over tens of thousands from the ruins of the dragon pit the heads of the five dragons that his followers had slain had been set up on posts and every night the shepherd would appear amongst them to preach with the dragons dead and the threat of immolation no longer imminent the prophet turned his wrath upon the highborn and wealthy only the poor and humble would ever see the halls of the gods he declared lords and knights and rich men would be cast down in their pride in avarice to hell cast off your silks and satins and clothe your nakedness in rough spun robes he told his followers throw away your shoes and walk barefoot through this world as the father made you thousands obeyed but thousands more turned away and each night the crowds that came to hear the prophet grew smaller at the other end of the street of the sisters gaiman pal hare's queer kingdom blossomed atop visenya's hill the court of this four-year-old bastard king was made up of [ __ ] mummers and thieves whilst gangs of ruffians sell swords and drunkards defended his rule one decree after another came down from the house of kisses where the child king had his seat each more outrageous than the last gaiman decreed that girls henceforth be equal with boys in matter of inheritance that the poor be given bread and beer in times of famine that men who had lost limbs in war must afterward be fed and housed by whichever lord they had been fighting for when the loss took place gaiman decreed that husbands who beat their wives should themselves be beaten irrespective of what the wives had done to warrant such chastisement these edicts were almost certainly the work of a dornish [ __ ] named salvanna sand reputably the paramour of the little king's mother essie if mushroom is to be believed royal decrees also issued 4th from the top aegin's high hill where sir perkins cat spa tristain sat the iron throne but those were of a very different nature the squire king began by repealing queen rainier's unpopular taxes and dividing the coin in the royal treasury amongst his own followers he followed that with a general cancellation of debt raised three score of his gutter knights to the ranks of nobility and answered king gaiman's promise to free bread and beer for the starving by granting the poor the right to take rabbits hares and deer from the kingswood as well though not elk nor boar all the while sir perkin the flea was recruiting scores of surviving gold cloaks to tristain's banner with their swords he took control the dragon's gate the king's gate and the lion gate giving him four of the city's seven gates and more than half of the towers along its walls in the early days after the queen's flight the shepherd was by far the most powerful of the city's three kings but as the nights passed the number of his followers continued to dwindle the small folk of the city woke as if from a bad dream except in eustis writes and like sinners waking cold and sober after a night of drunken debauchery and revel they turned away in shame hiding their faces from one another and hoping to forget though the dragons were dead and the queen fled such was the power of the iron throne that the comments still looked to the red keep when hungry or afraid so as the power of the shepherd waned on the hill of rhaenys the power of king trystane true fire as he now styled himself waxed atop aegen's high hill much and more was happening at tumbleton as well and it is there we must next turn our gaze as word of the unrest at king's landing reached prince darren's host many younger lords grow anxious to advance upon the city at once chief amongst them were sir john roxton sir roger corn and lord unwin pete but sir hobart hightower counseled caution and the two betrayers refused to join any attack unless their own demands were met off-white it will be called wished to be granted the great castle of highgarden with all its lands and incomes whilst hard hugh hammer desired nothing less than a crown for himself these conflicts came to a boil when tumbleton learned belatedly of aemon targaryen's death at harrenhal king aegon ii had not been seen nor heard from since the fall of king's landing to his half-sister rhaenyra and there were many who feared that the queen had put him secretly to death concealing the corpse so it's not to be condemned as a kinslayer with his brother eamon slain as well the greens found themselves kingless and leaderless prince darren stood next in the line of succession lord peake declared that the boys should be proclaimed as prince of dragonstone at once others believing egan ii died wished to crown him king the two betrayers felt the need of a king as well but darren targaryen was not the king they wanted we need a strong man to lead us not a boy declared heart you hammer the throne should be mine when bold john roxton demanded to know by what right he presumed to name himself a king lord hammer answered the same right as a conqueror a dragon and truly with vegard dead at last the oldest and largest living dragon in all westeros was vermathor once the mount of the old king now that of hard hue the bastard vermathor was thrice the size of prince darren's she-dragon to cerion no man who glimpsed them together could fail to see that vermathor was a far more fearsome beast though hammer's ambition was unseemly in one born so low the bastard undeniably possessed some targaryen blood and had proved himself fierce in battle and open handed to those who followed him displaying the sort of large gesh that draws men to leaders as a corpse draws flies they were the worst sort of men to be sure sell swords robber knights and like rabble men of tainted blood in uncertain birth who loved battle for its own sake and lived for rapine and plunder many had heard the prophecy that the hammer would smash the dragon and took it to mean that heart hugh's triumph was foreordained the lords and knights of old town and the reach were offended by the arrogance of the betrayer's claims however and none more so than prince darren himself who grew so roth that he threw up a cup of wine into hard to use face whilst lord white shrugged this off as a waste of good wine lord hammer said little boys should be more manly when men are speaking i think your father did not beat you often enough take care i do not make up for his lack the two betrayers took their leave together and began to make plans for hammer's coronation when seen the next day hart hugh was wearing a crown of black iron to the fury of prince darren and his trooper and lords and knights a crowd does not make a man a king he said you should wear a horseshoe on your head blacksmith it was a foolish thing to do lord hugh was not amused at his command his men forced sir roger to the ground whereupon the blacksmith's bastard nailed not one but three horseshoes to the night's skull when korn's friends tried to intervene daggers were drawn and swords unsheathed leaving three men dead and a dozen wounded that was more than prince darren's loyalist lords were prepared to suffer lord unwin peak and somewhat reluctant hobart hightower summoned 11 other lords and landed knights to a secret council and the seller of a tumbleton inn to discuss what might be done to curb the arrogance of the baseborne dragonriders the plotters agreed that it would be a simple matter to dispose of white who was a drunk more often not and had never shown any great prowess at arms hammer posed a greater danger for of late he was surrounded day and night by lick spittles camp followers and sell swords eager for his favor it would serve them little to kill white and leave hammer alive lord peek pointed out hard hue must needs die first long and loud were the arguments in the inn beneath the sign reading the bloody caltrops as the lords discussed how this might be best accomplished any man can be killed declared hobart hightower but what are the dragons given the turmoil at king's landing sir tyler norcross said tessarion alone should be enough to allow them to retake the iron throne lord peak replied that victory would be a deal more certain with vermithorn silverwing mark ambrose suggested that they take the city first then dispose of white and hammer after victory had been secured but richard rodden insisted such a course would be dishonorable we cannot ask these men to shed blood with us then kill them bold jon roxton settled the dispute we kill the bastards now he said afterward let the bravest of us claim their dragons and fly them into battle no man in the cellar doubted that roxton was speaking of himself though prince darren was not present at the council the caltrops as the conspirators became known were loathed to proceed without his consent and blessing owen fossaway lord of cider hall was dispatched under cover of darkness to wake the prince and bring him to the cellar that the plotters might inform him of their plans nor did the once gentle prince hesitate when lord unwin peak presented him with warrants for execution of hard hue hammer and off-white but eagerly affixed his seal men may plot and plan in scheme but they had best pray as well for no plan made by man has ever withstood the whims of the gods above two days later on the very day of the caltrops planned to strike tumbleton woke in the black of night to screams and shouts outside the town walls the camps were burning columns of armored knights were pouring in from north and west wreaking slaughter the clouds were raining arrows and a dragon was swooping down upon them terrible and fierce thus began the second battle of templeton the dragon was sea smoke his rider sir adam velaryon determined to prove that not all bastards need to be turncloaks how better to do that than by retaking templeton from the two betrayers whose treason had stained him singers say sir adam had flown from king's landing to the god's eye where he landed on this sacred isle of faces and took counsel with the green man the scholar must confine himself to known fact and what we know is that sir adam flew far and fast descending on the castle's great and small whose lords were loyal to the queen to piece together an army many a battle and skirmish had already been fought in the lands watered by the trident and there was scarce a keep or village that had not paid its dew and blood but adam valerion was relentless and determined and glib of tongue and the riverlords knew much and more of the horrors that had befallen tumbleton by the time sir adam was ready to descend on tumbleton he had near four thousand men at his back benjicore blackwood the twelve-year-old lord of raventree had come forth as had the widowed sabbath frey lady of the twins with her father and brothers of house viprin lord stanton piper josie smallwood derrick dary and lionel deadings had scraped together fresh levees of graybeards and green boys though all had suffered grievous losses in the autumn's battles hugo vance the young lord of wayfarer's rest had come with 300 of his own men plus black trombo's mirish sellswords most notably of all house tully had joined the war sea smoke's descent upon riverrun had at last persuaded that reluctant warrior sir elmo tully to call his banners for the queen in defiance of the wishes of his bed-ridden grandsire lord grover a dragon in one's courtyard does wandas to resolve one's doubts the great host encamped about the walls of tumbleton outnumbered the attackers but they had been too long in one place their discipline had grown lacks drunkenness was an epidemic in the camp grand maestermunken says and disease had taken root as well the death of lord orman hightower had left them without a leader and the lords who wished to command in his place were at odds with one another so intent were they upon their own conflicts and rivalries that they had all but forgotten their true foes sir adam's night attack took them completely unawares before the men of prince darren's army even knew they were in a battle the enemy was amongst them cutting them down as they staggered from their tents as they were saddling their horses struggling to don their armor buckling their sword belts most devastating of all was the dragon sea smoke he came swooping down again and yet again breathing flame a hundred tenths were soon a fire even the splendid silken pavilions of sir hobart hightower lord unwin peak and prince darren himself nor was the town of templeton reprieved those shops and homes and seps that had been spared the first time were engulfed in dragon flame darren targaryen was in his tent asleep when the attack began oath white was inside tumbleton sleeping off a night of drinking and an inn called the body badger that he had taken for his own heart hugh hammer was within the town walls as well in bed with the widow of a knight slain during the first battle all three dragons were outside the town in fields beyond the encampments though attempts were made to wake off white from his drunken slumber he proved impossible to rouse infamously he rolled under a table and snored throughout the entire battle hard hugh hammer was quicker to respond half-dressed he rushed down the steps to the yard calling for his hammer his armor and his horse so he might ride out to mount vermathor his men rushed to a bay even as sea smoke set the stables ablaze but lord john rockson had claimed lord footlee's bedchamber along with lord footley's wife and was already in the yard when he spied hard hugh roxton saw his chance and said lord hammer my condolences hammer turned glory for what he demanded you died in battle boldjon replied drawing orphan maker and thrusting deep into hammer's belly before opening the bastard from groin to throat a dozen of hard hues men came running in time to see him die even a valyrian steel blade like orphan maker little avails a man when it is one against ten bold john ruxton slew three before he was slain in turn it is said he died when his foot slipped on a coil of hugh hammer's entrails but perhaps that detail is too perfectly ironic to be true three conflicting accounts exist as to the manner of death of prince darren targaryen the best known claims that the prince stumbled from his pavilion with his night clothes of fire only to be cut down by the nearest shell sword black trombo who smashed his face in with a wing of his spiked morning star this version was the one preferred by black trombo who told it far and wide the second version is more or less the same save the prince was killed with a sword not a morning star and his slayer was not black trombo but some unknown man at arms who like it or not did not even realize whom he had killed in the third alternative the brave boy known as darren the daring did not even make it out at all but died when his burning pavilion collapsed upon him that is the version preferred by monken's true telling and by us in the sky above adam velaryon could see the battle turning into a route below him two of the three enemy dragon riders were dead but he would have had no way of knowing that he could doubtless see the enemy dragons however unchained they were kept beyond the town walls free to fly and hunt as they would silverwing and vermither off-coiled about one another on the fields south of templeton whilst tesarion slept and fed in prince darien's camp to the west of the town not a hundred yards from his pavilion dragons are creatures of fire and blood and all three roused as the battle bloomed around them a crossbowman let a fly a bolt at silver wing we are told and two square mounted knights closed on vermathor with sword and lance and axe hoping to dispatch the beast while he was still half asleep and on the ground they paid for that folly with their lives elsewhere on the field tesarion threw herself into the air shrieking and spitting flame and adam velaryon turns sea smoke to meet her a dragon's scales are largely though not entirely impervious to flame they protect the more vulnerable flesh and musculature beneath as a dragon ages its scales thicken and grow harder affording even more protection even as its flames burn hotter and fiercer where the flames of a hatchling can set straw a flame the flames of balerion or vegar in the fullness of their power could and did melt steel and stone when two dragons meet in mortal combat therefore they will often employ weapons other than their flame claws black as iron long as swords and sharp as razors jaws so powerful they can crunch through even a night steel plate tails like whips whose lashing blows who have been known to smash wagons to splinters break the spine of heavy destruyers and send men flying 50 feet in the air the battle between tesarion and sea smoke was different history caused the struggle between king aiken ii and his half-sister rhaenyra the dance of the dragons but only at tumbleton do the dragons ever truly dance teserion and sea smoke were young dragons nimbler in the air than their older kin time and time again they rushed one another only to have one or the other veer away at the last instant soaring like eagles stooping like hawks they circled snapping and roaring spitting fire and never closing once the blue queen vanished into a bank of cloud only to reappear an instant later diving on sea smoke from behind to scorch his tail with a burst of cobalt flame meanwhile sea smoke rolled and banked and looped one instant he would be below his foe and suddenly he would twist in the sky and come around behind her higher and higher the two dragons flew as hundreds watched from the roofs of tumbleton one such said afterward that the flight of tesarion and sea smoke seemed more mating dance than battle perhaps it was the dance ended when verma thor rose roaring into the sky almost a hundred years old and as large as the two dragons put together the bronze dragon with the great tan wings was in a rage as he took flight with blood smoking from a dozen wounds riderless he knew not friend from foe so he loosed his wrath on all spitting flame to right to left turning savagely on any man who dared to fling a spear in his direction one knight tried to flee before him only to have vermithor snatch him up in his jaws even as his horse galloped on lord's piper and deadings seated together atop a low rise burned with their squires servants and sworn shields when the bronze fury chanced to take note of them an instant later sea smoke fell upon him alone of the four dragons on the field that day sea smoke had a rider sir adam velaryon had come to prove his loyalty by destroying the two betrayers and the dragons and here was one beneath him attacking the men who had joined him for this fight he must have felt duty-bound to protect them though surely he knew in his heart that his sea smoke could not match the older dragon this was no dance but a fight to the death vermethor had been flying no more than 20 feet above the battle when sea smoke slammed into him from above driving him shrieking into the mud men and boys ran in terror or were crushed as the two dragons rolled and tore at one another tails snapped and wings beat at the air but the beasts were so entangled that neither was able to break free benjicote blackwood watched the struggle from atop his horse 50 yards away vermithor's size and weight were too much for sea smoke to contend with lord blackwood told grandmaster monken many years later and he would surely have torn the silver gray dragon to pieces if tesarion had not fallen from the sky that very moment to join the fight who can know the heart of a dragon was it a simple bloodlust that drove the blue queen to attack did the she-dragon come to help one of the combatants if so which some will claim that the bond between a dragon and a dragon rider runs so deep that the beast shares his master's loves and hates but who is the ally here and who the enemy does a riderless dragon know friend from foe we shall never know the answers to those questions all that history tells us is that three dragons fought amidst the mud and blood and smoke of second tupleton sea smoke was the first to die when vermithor locked his teeth into his neck and ripped his head off afterward the bronze dragon tried to take flight with his prize still in his jaws but his tattered wings could not lift his weight after a moment he collapsed and died tesarion the blue queen lasted until sunset thrice she tried to regain the sky and thrice failed by late afternoon she seemed to be in pain so lord blackwood summoned his best archer a longbowman named billy burley who took up a position a hundred yards away beyond the range of the dying dragon's fires and sent three shafts into her eye as she lay helpless on the ground by dusk the fighting was done though the riverlords lost less than a hundred men whilst cutting down more than a thousand of the men from old town in the reach second tumbleton cannot be accounted a complete victory for the attackers as they failed to take their town tumbleton's walls were still intact and once the king's men had fallen back inside and closed their gates the queen's forces had no way to make a breach lacking both siege equipment and dragons even so they wreaked great slaughter on their confused and disorganized foes fired their tents burned or captured almost all their wagons fodder and provisions made off with three quarters of their war horses slew their prince and put an end to two of the king's dragons at moonrise the riverlords abandoned the field to the carrion crows fading back into the hills one of them the boy ben blackwood carried with him the broken body of sir adam velaryon found dead beside his dragon his bones would rest at raventree hall for eight years but in 138 ac his brother alan would have them return to driftmark and entombed in hull the town of his birth on his tomb is engraved a single word loyal its ornate letters are supported by carvings of a seahorse and a mouse on the morning after the battle the conquerors of tumbleton looked out from the town walls to find their foes gone the dead were strewn all around the city and amongst them sprawled the carcasses of three dragons one remained silver wing good queen alison's mount and days of old had taken to the sky as the carnage began circling the battlefield for hours soaring on the hot winds rising from the fires below only after dark did she descend to land beside her slain cousins later singers would tell of how she thrice lifted vermathor's wing with her nose as if to make him fly again but this is most like a fable the rising sun would find her flapping liciously across the field feeding on the burned remains of horses men and oxen eight of the thirteen caltrips lay dead amongst them lord owen fossaway mark ambrose and bol john roxton richard rodden had taken an arrow to the neck and would die the next day four of the plotters remain amongst them sir hobart hightower and lord unwin peak and though hardhu hammer had died and his dreams of kingship with him the second betrayer remained off-white had woken from his drunken sleep to find himself the last dragon rider and possessed of the last dragon the hammer's dead and your boy is well he is purported to have told lord peake all you've got left is me when lord peake asked him his intentions white replied we march just how you wanted you take the city i'll take the bloody throne how's that the next morning sir hobert hightower called upon him to thrash out the details of their assault upon king's landing he brought with him two casts of wine as a gift one of dornish red and one of arbor gold though alf the sot had never tasted a wine he did not like he was known to be partial to the sweeter vintages no doubt sir hobart hoped to sip the sour red whilst lord of course down the arbor gold yet something about hightower's manor he was swearing and stammering and too hardy by half the squire who served them testified later pricked white suspicions wary he commanded that the dornish red be set aside for later and insisted sir hobart share the arbor gold with him history has little good to say about sir hobart hightower but no man can question the manner of his death rather than betray his fellow caltrops he let the squire fill his cup drank deep and ask for more once he saw a hightower drink ulf the sot lived up to his name putting down three cups before he began to yawn the poison in the wine was a gentle one lord olf went to sleep never to awaken sir hobart lurched to his feet and tried to make himself wretch but too late his heart stopped within the hour no man ever feared a hobbert's sword mushroom says of him but his wine cup was deadlier than valyrian steel afterward lord unwin peak offered a thousand golden dragons to any knight of noble birth who could claim silver wing three men came forth when the first had his arm torn off and the second burned to death the third man reconsidered by that time pique's army the tenants of the great host that prince darren and lord orman hightower had led all the way from old town was falling to pieces as deserters fled tumbleton by the score with all the plunder they could carry bowing to defeat lord unwin summoned his lords and sergeants and ordered a retreat the accused turncloak adam velaryon born adam of hull had saved king's landing from the queen's foes at the cost of his own life yet the queen knew nothing of his valor rhaenyra's flight from king's landing had been beset with difficulty at rossby she found the castle gates barred at her approach by the command of the young woman whose claim she had passed over in favor of a younger brother young lord stokeworth's casteline granted her hospitality but only for a night they will come for you he warned the queen and i do not have the power to resist them half of her gold cloaks deserted on the road and one night her camp was attacked by broken men though her knights beat off the attackers surveillan birch was felled by an arrow and sir lionel bentley a young knight of the queen's guard suffered a blow to the head that cracked his helm he perished raving the following day the queen pressed on toward duskendale house starklin had been amongst rhaenyra's strongest supporters but the cost of that loyalty had been high lord gunther had lost his life in the queen's service as had his uncle stefan duskendale itself had been sacked by sir christian cole small wonder then that lord gunther's widow was less than overjoyed when her grace appeared at her gates only the intercession of sir harold dark persuaded lady meredith to allow the queen within her walls at all the darks were instant kin to the darklins and sir harold had once served as a squire to the late lord stefan and only upon the condition that she would not remain for long once safely behind the walls of the dunfort overlooking the harbor rhaenyra commanded lady darkland's maester to send word to grand maester gyaradus on dragonstone asking that a shipy sent it once to take her home three ravens flew the town chronicles assert yet as the days passed no ship appeared nor did any reply return from gyarados on dragonstone to the queen's fury once again she began to question her grand maester's loyalty the queen had better fortune elsewhere from winterfell cregan stark wrote to say that he would bring a host south as soon as he could but warned that it would take some time to gather his men for my realms are large and with winter upon us we must needs bring in our last harvest or starve when the snows come to stay the northmen promised the queen ten thousand men younger and fiercer than my winter wolves the maiden of the vale promised aid as well when she replied from her winter castle the gates of the moon but with the mountain passes closed by snow her knights would need to come by sea if house velaryon would send ships to goldtown lady jane wrote she would dispatch an army to duskendale at once if not she must needs hire ships from braavos and pentos and for that she would need coin queen rhaenyra had neither gold nor ships when she had sent lord corliss to the dungeon she had lost her fleet and she had fled king's landing in tariff of her life without so much as a coin despairing and fearful her grace walked the castle battlements of duskendale weeping growing ever more gray and haggard she could not sleep and would not eat nor would she suffer to be parted from prince aegon her last living son day and night the boy remained by her side like a small pale shadow when lady meredith made it plain that the queen had overstayed her welcome rhaenyra was forced to sell her crown to raise the coin to bind passage on a bravosi merchantman the vo land so harold dark urged her to seek refuge with lady aaron in the veil while sir medrick manderly tried to persuade her to accompany him and his brother sir tauren back to white harbor but her grace refused them both she was adamant on returning to dragonstone there she would find dragon's egg she told her loyalist she must have another dragon or all was lost strong winds pushed the vial on closer to the shores of driftmark than the queen might have wished and thrice she passed within hailing distance of the sea snake's warships but right nira took care to keep well out of sight finally the bravosi put into the harbor below the dragon mont on the event tide the queen had sent a raven from duskendale to give notice of her coming and found an escort waiting as she disembarked with her son again her ladies and three queens guard knights the gold cloaks who had ridden with her from king's landing stayed at duskendale whilst the manderlys remained aboard the violand bound for white harbor it was raining when the queen's party came ashore and hardly a phase was to be seen about the port even the dockside brothels appeared dark and deserted but her grace took no notice sick and body and spirit broken by betrayal rhaenyra targaryen only wanted to return to her own seat where she imagined that she and her son would be safe little did the queen know that she was about to suffer her last and most grievous treachery her escort 40 strong was commanded by sir alfred broome one of the men left behind when rhaenyra had launched her attack upon king's landing broome was the most senior of the knights at dragonstone having joined the garrison during the reign of the old king as such he had expected to be named as castelin when rhaenyra went forth to seize the iron throne but sir alfred's sullen disposition and sour manner inspired neither affection nor trust mushroom tells us so the queen had passed him over in favor of the more affable sir robert quince when rhaenyra asked why sir robert had not come to meet her sir alfred replied that the queen would be seeing our fat friend at the castle and so she did though quince's charred corpse was burned beyond all recognition when they came upon it only by his size did they know him for sir robert had been enormously fat they found him hanging from the battlemen to the gatehouse beside dragonstone steward captain the guard bastard arms and the head and upper torso of grand maester gyaradis everything below his ribs was gone and the grandmaster's entrails dangled down from within his torn belly like so many burned black snakes the blood drained from the queen's cheeks when she beheld the bodies but young prince agen was the first to realize what they meant mother flee he shouted but too late sir alfred's men fell upon the queen's protectors and axe splits or harold drake's head before his sword could clear its scabbard and sir adrian redford was stabbed through the back with a spear only sir lorth lansdale moved quickly enough to strike a blow in the queen's defense cutting down the first two men who came at him before being slain himself with him died the last of the queen's guard when prince aegin snatched up sir howald's sword sir alfred knocked the blade aside contemptuously the boy the queen and her ladies were marched at spear point through the gates of dragonstone to the castle ward there as mushroom put it so memorably many years later they found themselves face to face with a dead man and a dying dragon sunfire's scales still shone like beaten gold in the sunlight but as he sprawled across the fused black valyrian stone of the yard it was plain to see he was a broken thing he who had been the most magnificent dragon ever to fly the skies of westeros the wing all but torn from his body by melees jutted at an awkward angle whilst fresh scars along his back still smoked and bled when he moved sunfire was coiled in a ball when the queen and her party first beheld him as he stirred and raised his head huge wounds were visible along his neck where another dragon had torn chunks from his flesh on his belly were places where scabs had replaced scales and where his right eye should have been was only an empty hole crusted with black blood one must ask as rhaenyra surely did how this had come to pass we now know much and more that the queen did not for that we must be grateful to grand mr munken for it was his true telling based in larger part in the account of grand maester orwell that revealed how agen ii came to dragonstone it was lord lars strong the clubfoot who spirited the king and his children out of the city when the queen's dragons first appeared in the skies above king's landing so as to not pass through any of the city gates where they might be seen and remembered lord laras led them out through the secret passage of maker the cruel of which only he had knowledge it was lord lariss who decreed the fugitive should part company as well so that even if one were taken the others might win free sir rickard thorne was commanded to deliver two-year-old prince maylor to lord hightower princess jihara a sweet and simple girl of six was put in charge of so willis fell who swore to bring her safely to storm's end neither knew where the other was bound so neither could betray the other if captured and only larys himself knew that the king stripped of his finery and clad in a salt-stained fisherman's cloak had been concealed amongst a load of codfish on a fishing skiff in the care of a bastard knight with kin on dragonstone once she learned the king was gone the clubfoot reasoned rhaenyra was sure to send men hunting after him but a boat leaves no trail upon the waves and few hunters would ever think to look for aegon on his sister's own island in the very shadow of her stronghold all this grand maester orwell had from lord strong's own lips monken tells us and there agen might have remained hidden yet harmless dulling his pain with wine and hiding his burn scars beneath a heavy cloak had sunfire not made his way to dragonstone we may ask what drew him back to the dragon mod for many have was the wounded dragon with his half-healed broken wing driven by some primal instinct to return to his birthplace the smoking mountain where he had emerged from his egg or did he somehow sense the presence of king aegon on the island across long leagues and stormy seas and fly there to rejoin his rider septon eustis goes so far as to suggest that sunfire sensed aegin's desperate need but who can presume to know the heart of a dragon after lord wallace mooton's ill-fated attack drove him from the field of ash and bone outside rook's rest history loses sight of sunfire for more than half a year certain tales told in the halls of the crabs and broon suggest the dragon might have taken refuge in the dark punny woods and caves of crack law point for some of that time though his torn wing had mended enough for him to fly it had healed at an ugly angle and it remained weak sunfire could no longer soar nor remain in the air for long but must need struggle to fly even short distances the full mushroom cruelly says that whereas most dragons moved through the sky like eagles sunfire had become no more than a great golden fire-breathing chicken hopping and fluttering from hill to hill yet this fire-breathing chicken crossed the waters of the blackwater bay for it was sunfire that the sailors on the nasaria had seen attacking great ghost sir robert quinn said blame the cannibal but tom tangletong a stammerer who had heard more than he said had plied the volantines with ale making note of all the times they mentioned the attacker's golden scales the cannibal as he knew well was black as coal and so the two toms and their cousins a half-truth as only sir marston shared their blood being the bastard son of tom tanglebeard's sister by the knight who took her maidenhead set sail in their small boat to seek out grey ghost's killer the burned king and the maimed dragon each found new purpose in the other from a hidden layer on the desolate eastern slopes of the dragonmon aegin ventured fourth each day at dawn taking to the sky again for the first time since rook's rest whilst the two toms and their cousin marston waters returned to the other side of the island to seek out men willing to help them take the castle even on dragonstone long queen rhaenyra seat and stronghold they found many who misliked the queen for reasons both good and ill some grieve for their brothers sons and fathers slain during the sowing or during the battle of the gullet some hoped for a plunder or advancement whilst others believed a son must come before a daughter giving aegin the better claim the queen had taken her best men with her to king's landing on its island protected by the sea snake ships and its valyrian high walls dragonstone seemed unassailable so the garrison her grace left to defend it was small made up largely of men judged to be of little other use gray beards and green boys the halt and slow and crippled men recovering from wounds men of doubtful loyalty men suspected of cowardice over them rhaenyra plays sir robert quince an able man grown old and fat quince was a steadfast supporter of the queen i'll agree but some of the men under him were less leel harboring certain resentments and grudges for old wrongs real or imagined prominent amongst them was sir alfred broome broome proved more than willing to betray his queen in return for a promise of lordship lands and gold should aegin ii regain the throne his long service with the garrison allowed him to advise the king's men on dragonstone's strengths and weaknesses which guards could be bribed or won over and which must needs be killed or imprisoned when it came the fall of dragonstone took less than an hour men traduced by broome opened a postern gate during the hour of ghost to allow sir marston waters tom tangletong and their men to slip into the castle unobserved while one band seized the armory and another took dragonstone's leo guardsman and mastered arms into custody sir marston surprised grand maester gyaradis in his rookery so no word of the attack might escape by raven sir alfred himself led the men who burst into the castelin's chambers to surprise sir robert quince as quinch struggled to rise from his bed broom drove a spear into his huge pale belly mushroom who knew both men well says her alfred misliked and resented sir robert this may well be believed for the thrust was delivered with such force that the spear went out sir robert's back through the featherbed and straw mattress and into the floor beneath only in one respect did the plan go awry as tom tangletung and his ruffians smashed down the door of lady bayla's bedchamber to take her prisoner the girl slipped out of her window scrambling across rooftops and down walls until she reached the yard the king's men had taken care to send guards to secure the stable where the castle dragons had been kept but bayla had grown up in dragonstone and knew ways in and out that they did not by the time her pursuers caught up with her she had already loosened moondancer's chains and strapped a saddle onto her so it came to pass that when king aegon ii flew sunfire over dragonmon's smoking peak and made his descent expecting to make a triumphant entrance into a castle safely in the hands of his own men with the queen's loyalists slain or captured up to meet him rose baylor targaryen prince damon's daughter by lady laina as fearless as her father moondancer was a young dragon pale green with horns and crest and wing bones of pearl aside from her great wings she was no larger than a war horse and weighed less she was very quick however and sunfire though much larger still struggled with a malformed wing and had taken fresh wounds from grey ghost they met amidst the darkness that comes before the dawn shadows in the sky lighting the night with their fires moondancer eluded sunfire's flames eluded his jaws darted beneath his grasping claws then came around and raked the larger dragon from above opening a long smoking wound down his back and tearing at his injured wing watchers below said that sunfire alerts drunkenly in the air fighting to stay aloft whilst moondancer turned and came back at him spitting fire sunfire answered with a furnace blast of golden flame so bright it lit the yard below like a second sun a blast that took moondancer full in the eyes like is not the young dragon was blinded in that instant yet she still flew on slamming into sunfire in a tangle of wings and claws as they fell moondancer struck at sunfire's neck repeatedly tearing out mouthfuls of flesh whilst the elder dragon sank his claws into her underbelly robed in fire and smoke blind and bleeding moondancer beat her wings desperately as she tried to break away but all her efforts did was slow their fall the watchers in the yard scrambled for safety as the dragon slammed into the hard stone still fighting on the ground moondancer's quickness proved a little use against sunfire's size and weight the green dragon soon lay still the golden dragon screamed his victory and tried to rise again only to collapse back to the ground with hot blood pouring from his wounds king agen had leapt from the saddle when the dragons were still 20 feet from the ground shattering both legs lady bayless stayed with moondancer all the way down burned and battered the girl still found the strength to undo her saddle chains and crawl away as her dragon coiled in her final death throws when alfred broome drew his sword to slay her marston waters wrenched the blade from his hand tom tangletong carried her to the maester thus did king aegon ii win the ancestral seat of house targaryen but the price he paid for it was dire sunfire would never fly again he remained in the yard where he had fallen feeding on the carcass of moondancer and later on sheep slaughtered for him by the garrison and egan ii lived the rest of his life in great pain though to his honor when grand maester gerardus offered him milk of the poppy he refused i shall not walk that road again he said nor am i such a fool as to drink any potion you might prepare for me you are my sister's creature at the king's command the chain that princess rainier had torn from grandmaster orwile's neck and given to gerardus was now used to hang him he was not given a quick end of a hard fall in a broken neck but rather a slow strangulation kicking as a grasp for air thrice when he was almost dead gerardus was let down and allowed to catch a breath only to be hauled up again after the third time he was disemboweled and dangled before sunfire so the dragon might feast upon his legs and inards but the king commanded that enough of the grandmaster be saved so he might greet my sweet sister on her return not long after as the king lay in the stone drums great hall his broken legs bound and splinted the first of queen rhaenyra's ravens arrived from duskendale when aegon learned that his half-sister would be returning to the violand he commanded sir alfred broome to prepare a suitable welcome for her homecoming all of this is known to us now none of this was known to the queen when she stepped ashore into her brother's trap septon eustis who had no love for the queen tells us rhaenyra laughed when she beheld the ruin of sunfire the golden whose work is this he has her saying we must thank them mushroom who had much love for the queen tells a different tale in his account rhaenyra says how has it come to this both accounts agree that the next words are spoken by the king sister he called down from a balcony unable to walk or even stand he had been carried there in a chair the hip shattered at rook's rest had left aegin bent and twisted his once handsome features had grown puffy from milk of the poppy and burn scars covered half his body yet rhaenyra knew him at once and said dear brother i had hoped that you were dead after you again answered you are the elder i am pleased to know that you remember that rhaenyra answered it would seem we are your prisoners but do not think that you will hold us long my little lords will find me if they searched the seven hells mayhaps the king made answer as his mentor rhaenyra from her son's arms some accounts say it was sir alfred broome who had hold of her arm others named the two toms tanglebeard the father and tangle tongue the sun sir marston waters stood witness as well clad in the white cloak for king again had named him to the kingsguard for his valor yet neither waters nor any of the other knights and lords present in the yard spoke a word of protest as king aegon ii delivered his half-sister to his dragon sunfire it is said did not seem at first to take any interest in the offering until broome pricked the queen's breast with his dagger the smell of blood roused the dragon who sniffed at her grace then bathed her in a blast of flame so suddenly that's her alfred's cloak caught fire as he leapt away rhaenyra targaryen had time to raise her head toward the sky and shriek out one last curse upon her half-brother before sunfire's jaws closed around her tearing off her arm and shoulder septon eustis tells us that the golden dragon devoured the queen in six bites leaving only her left leg below the shin for the stranger elinda massey youngest and gentlest of rhaenyra's ladies in waiting supposedly gouged out her own eyes at the site whilst the queen's son egg and the younger watched in horror unable to move rhaenyra targaryen the realms delight and half-year queen passed from this veil of tears upon the 22nd day of the 10th moon of the 130th year after aegon's conquest she was 33 years of age sir after broome argued for killing prince aegin as well but king aegin forbade it only 10 the boy might yet have value as a hostage he declared though his half-sister was dead he still had supporters in the field who must needs be dealt with before his grace could hope to sit the iron throne again so prince aegon was manacled at neck wrist and ankle and led down to the dungeons under dragonstone the late queen's ladies in waiting being of noble birth were given cells in sea dragon tower there to await ransom the time for hiding is done king aegon ii declared let the ravens fly that the realm may know the pretender is dead and their true king is coming home to reclaim his father's throne fire and blood chapter 17.
