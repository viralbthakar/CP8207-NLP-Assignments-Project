 fire and blood being a history of the targaryen kings of westeros vol 1 from aegon the first the conqueror to the regency of aegon iii the dragon bane by archmaester gildane of the citadel of old town transcribed by george r.r martin aegon's conquest the maesters of the citadel who keep the histories of westeros have used aegon's conquest as their touchstone for the past 300 years births deaths battles and other events are dated either ac after the conquest or bc before the conquest true scholars know that such dating is far from precise egg and targaryen's conquest of the seven kingdoms did not take place in a single day more than two years passed between aegon's landing and his old town coronation and even then the conquest remained incomplete since dorne remained unsubdued sporadic attempts to bring the dornishment into the realm continued all through king aegon's reign and well into the reign of his sons making it impossible to fix a precise end date for the wars of conquest even the start date is a matter of some misconception many assume wrongly that the reign of king aegon the first targaryen began on the day he landed at the mouth of the blackwater rush beneath the three hills where the city of king's landing would eventually stand not so the day of aegon's landing was celebrated by the king and his descendants but the conqueror actually dated the start of his reign from the day he was crowned and anointed in the starry sept of old town by the high septon of the faith this coronation took place two years after aegon's landing well after all three of the major battles of the wars of conquest had been fought and won thus it can be seen that most of aegon's actual conquering took place from 2 to 1 bc before the conquest the targaryens were of pure valyrian blood dragonlords of ancient lineage 12 years before the doom of valyria 114 bc aynor targaryen sold his holdings in the freehold and the lands of the long summer and moved with all his wives wealth slaves dragons siblings kin and children to dragonstone a bleak island citadel beneath a smoking mountain in the narrow sea at its apex valyria was the greatest city in the known world the center of civilization within its shining walls two-score rival houses vied for power and glory in court and council rising and falling in an endless subtle oft-savage struggle for dominance the targaryens were far from the most powerful the dragonlords and their rivals saw their flight to dragonstone as an act of surrender as cowardice but lord aynar's maiden daughter danys known forever afterward as danis the dreamer had foreseen the destruction of illyria by fire and when the doom came twelve years later the targaryens were the only dragon lords to survive dragonstone had been the westernmost outpost of valyrian power for two centuries its location a thwart the gullet gave its lords a stranglehold on blackwater bay and enabled both the targaryens and their close allies the velaryons of driftmark a lesser house of the valyrian descent to fill their coffers off the passing trade valerian ships along with those of another allied valyrian house the celtigars of claw isle dominated the middle reaches of the narrow sea whilst the targaryens ruled the skies with their dragons yet even so for the best part of a hundred years after the doom of valyria the rightly named century of blood house targaryen looked east not west and took little interest in the affairs of westeros gaiman targaryen brother and husband to danish the dreamer followed anar the exile as lord of dragonstone and became known as gaiman the glorious gaiman the glorious son aegon and his daughter elena ruled together after his death after them the lordship passed their son megan his brother aerys and aerys son elix balon and damian the last of the three brothers was damien whose son arion then succeeded to dragonstone the aegon who would be known to history as aegon the conqueror and aegon the dragon was born on dragonstone in 27 bc he was the only son and second child of arion lord of dragonstone and lady velenia of house velaryon herself half targaryen on her mother's side aegon had two true born siblings an elder sister vicenja and a younger sister rhaenys it had long been the custom amongst the dragonlords of valyria to wed brother to sister to keep the bloodlines pure but aegon took both his sisters to bride by tradition he would have been expected to only wed his older sister visenya the inclusion of rhaenys as a second wife was unusual though not without precedent it was said by some that aegon wed visenya out of duty and rhaenys out of desire all three siblings had shown themselves to be dragon lords before they wed of the five dragons who had flown with aynar the exile from valyria only one survived to aegon's day the great beast called valyrian the black dread the dragons veigar and miraxis were younger hatched on dragonstone itself a common myth oft's heard amongst the ignorant claims that aegon targaryen had never set foot upon the soil of westeros until the day he set sail to conquer it but this cannot be truth years before that sailing the painted table had been carved and decorated at lord aegon's command a massive slab of wood some 50 feet long carved in the shape of westeros and painted to show all the woods and rivers and towns and castles of the seven kingdoms plainly aegon's interest in westeros long predated the events that drove him to war as well there are reliable reports of aegon and his sister visenya visiting the citadel of old town in their youth and hawking on the arbor as guest of lord redwine he may have visited lannisport as well but accounts differ the westeros of aegon's youth was divided into seven quarrelsome kingdoms and there was hardly a time when two or three of these kingdoms were not at war with one another the vast cold stony north was ruled by the starks of winterfell in the deserts of dorne the martell princes held sway the gold rich westerlands were ruled by the lannisters of a castle rock the fertile reached by the gardeners of highgarden the veil the fingers and the mountains of the moon belonged to house aaron but the most belligerent kings of aegon's time were the two whose realm laid closest to dragonstone haron the black and argilac the arrogant from their great citadel storm's end the storm kings of house duranten had once ruled the eastern half of westeros from cape wrath to the bay of crabs but the powers had been dwindling for centuries the kings of the reach had nibbled at their domains from the west the dornish men harassed them from the south and howard the black and his iron man had pushed them from the trident and the lands of the north of the blackwater rush king argilac last of the durandon had arrested this decline for a time turning back a dornish invasion while still a boy crossing the narrow sea to join the great alliance against the imperialist tigers of atlantis and slaying gars gardner the seventh king of the reach in the battle of summerfield 20 years later north of the blackwater the riverlands were ruled by the bloody hand of harren the black of house  king of the isles and rivers heron's ironborn grandsire harwin hardhand had taken the trident from argilac's grandsire eric whose own forebears had thrown down the last of the river kings centuries earlier heron's father had extended his domains east to duskendale and rosby heron himself had devoted most of his long reign close on 40 years to building a gigantic castle beside the god's eye but with harrenhal at last near in completion the ironborder would soon be free to seek fresh conquests no king in westeros was more feared than black heron whose cruelty had become legendary all through the seven kingdoms and no king in westeros felt more threatened than argilac the storm king last of the durandon an aging warrior whose only heir was his maiden daughter thus it was that king argilac reached out to the targaryens on dragonstone offering lord aegon his daughter in marriage with all the lands east of the god's eye from the trident to the blackwater rush as her dowry aegon targaryen spurned the storm king's proposal he had two wives he pointed out he did not need a third and the dower lands being offered had belonged to harrenhal for more than a generation they were not arglax to give plainly the aging storm king meant to establish the targaryens along the blackwater as a buffer between his own lands and those of heron the black the lord of dragonstone countered with an offer of his own he would take the dower lands being offered if argilac would also seed macy's hook and the woods and planes from the blackwater south to the river when water and the headwaters of the mandar the pact would be sealed with the marriage of argilac's daughter to oris baratheon lord aegon's childhood friend and champion these terms are galactic the arrogant rejected angrily oars baratheon was a baseborne half-brother to lord aegon it was whispered and the storm king would not dishonor his daughter by giving her a hand to a bastard the very suggestion enraged him argilac had the hands of aegon's envoy cut off and returned to him in a box these are the only hands your bastard should have of me he wrote aegon made no reply instead he summoned his friends bannermen and principal allies to attend him on dragonstone their numbers were small the valerians of driftmark were sworn to house targaryen as were the saltigars of claw isle from massey's hook came lord bar emmon of sharp point and lord massey of stone dance both sworn to storm's end but with closer ties to dragonstone lord aegon and his sisters took council with them and visited the castle sept to pray to the seven of westeros as well though he had never before been accounted as a pious man on the seventh day a cloud of ravens burst from the towers of dragonstone to bring lord aegon's word to the seven kingdoms of westeros to the seven kings they flew to the citadel of old town to the lords of both great and small all carried the same message from this day forth there would be but one king in westeros those who bent the knee to aegon of house targaryen were to keep their lands and titles those who took up arms against him would be thrown down humbled and destroyed accounts differ on how many swords set sail from dragonstone with aegon and his sisters some say three thousand others number them only in the hundreds this modest targaryen host put a shore at the mouth of the blackwater rush on the northern bank where three wooded hills rose above a small fishing village in the days of the hundred kingdoms many petty kings had claimed dominion over the river mouth amongst them the darklin kings of duskendale the masses of stone dance and the river kings of old be they muds fissures brackens blackwoods or hooks towers and forts had crowned the three hills at various times only to be thrown down in one war or another now only broken stones and overgrown ruins remain to welcome the targaryens though claimed by both storms and in harrenhal the river mouth was undefended and the closest castles were held by lesser lords of no great power or military prowess and lords moreover had little reason to love their nominal overlord hare in the black aegon targaryen quickly threw up a log in earth palestine around the highest of the three hills and dispatched his sisters to secure the submission of the nearest castles rosby yielded to rhaenys and the golden eyed meraxis without a fight at stokeworth a few crossbowmen loose bolts of asenya until vegar's flames set the roofs of the castle keep ablaze then they too submitted the conqueror's first true test came from lord darklin of duskendale and lord mooton of maidenpool who joined their power and marched south with three thousand men to drive the invaders back into the sea aegon sent orris baratheon out to attack them on the march whilst he descended on them from above with the black dread both lords were slain in a one-sided battle that followed darkland's son and mooton's brother thereafter yielded up their castles and swore their swords to house targaryen at that time duskendale was the principal westerosi port on the narrow sea and had grown fat and wealthy from the trade that passed through its harbor visenya targaryen did not allow this town to be sacked but she did not hesitate to claim its riches greatly swelling the coffers of the conquerors this perhaps would be an apt place to discuss the differing characters of aegon targaryen and his sisters in queens visenya eldest of the three siblings was as much a warrior as aegon himself as comfortable in ringmail as in silk she carried the valyrian longsword dark sister and was skilled in its use having trained beside her brother since childhood though possessed of the silver gold hair and purple eyes of valyria hers was a harsh austere beauty even those who loved her found vicenia stern serious and unforgiving some said that she played with poisons and dabbled in dark sorceries rainey's youngest of the three targaryens was all her sister was not playful curious impulsive given to flights of fancy no true warrior rhaenys loved music dancing and poetry and supported many a singer mummer and puppeteer yet it was said that ringy spent more time on dragon back than her brother and sister combined for above all things she'd love to fly she once was heard to say that before she died she meant to fly meraxis across the sunset sea to see what lay upon its western shores whilst no one ever questioned vicenia's fidelity to her brother husband rhaenys surrounded herself with calmly young men and it was whispered even entertained some in her bed chambers on the nights when aegon was with her elder sister yet despite these rumors observers at court cannot fail to note that the king spent 10 nights with rhaenys for every one night with visenya aegon the conqueror himself strangely was as much an enigma to his contemporaries as to us armed with the valyrian steel blade blackfyre he was counted amongst the greatest warriors of his age yet he took no pleasure in the feats of arms and he never rode in tony or melee his mount was believing the black dread but he flew only to battle or to travel swiftly across land and sea his commanding presence drew men to his banners yet he had no close friends save orus baratheon the companion of his youth women were drawn to him but aegon remained ever faithful to his sisters as king he put great trust in his small council and his sisters leaving much of the day-to-day governance of the realm to them yet he did not hesitate to take command when he found it necessary though he dealt harshly with rebels and traders he was open-handed with former foes who bent the knee this he showed for the first time at the aegon fort the crude wooden earth castle he had raised atop what would henceforth forever be known as aegon's high hill having taken a dozen castles and secured the mouth of the blackwater rush on both sides of the river he commanded the lords he had defeated to attend him there he laid their swords at his feet and aegon raised them up and confirmed them in their lands and titles to his oldest supporters he gave new honors damon valerion lord of the tides was made master of ships in command of the royal fleet tristan massey lord of stone dance was named master of loss crispy and zeldagar master of coin and aorus brath and he proclaimed to be my shield my stalwart my strong right hand thus baratheon is reckoned by the maesters the first king's hand heraldic banners had been a long tradition amongst the lords of westeros but such had never been used by the dragonlords of old valyria when aegon's knights unfurled his great silken battle standard with a red three-headed dragon breathing fire upon a black field the lords took it for a sign that he was now truly one of them a worthy high king for westeros when queen visenya placed a valyrian steel circlet started with rubies on her brother's head and queen rhaenys hailed him as aegon first of his name king of all westeros and shield of his people the dragons roared and the lords and knights set up a cheer but the small folk the fishermen and the field hands and good wives shouted loudest of all the seven kings that aegon the dragon meant to uncrowned were not cheering however in harrenhal and storm's end haron the black and argilac the arrogant had already called their banners in the west king myrn of the reach rode the ocean road north to casterly rock to meet king lauren of house lannister the princess of dorne dispatched a raven to dragonstone offering to join aegon against argilac the storm king but as an equal in an ally not a subject another offer of alliance came from the boy king of the eerie ronald aaron whose mother asked for all the lands east of the green fork of the trident for the vale support against black heron even in the north king tauren stark of winterfell sat with his lords bannermen and counselors late into the night discussing what was to be done about this would-be conqueror the whole realm waited anxiously to see where aegon would move next within days of his coronation aegon's armies were on the march again the greater part of his host crossed the blackwater rush making south for storm's end under the command of orys baratheon queen rainey is a comp queen rhaenys accompanied him a stride miraxis of the golden eyes and silver scales the targaryen fleet under daemon velaryon left blackwater bay and turned north for goldtown and the vale with them went queen visenya and vegar the king himself marched northwest to the god's eye in harrenhal the gargantuan fortress that was the pride and obsession of king harren the black all three of the targaryen thrusts faced fierce opposition lords errol fell and buckler bannermen to the storm's end surprised the advancements of ors baratheon's hosts as they were crossing the wind water cutting down more than a thousand men before fading back into the trees a hastily assembled aran fleet augmented by a dozen bravosi warships met and defeated the targaryen fleet in the waters off galltown amongst the dead was aegon's admiral damon velaryon aegon himself was attacked on the sore shore of the god's eye not once but twice the battle of the reeds was a targaryen victory but they suffered heavy losses at the wailing willows when two of king harron's son crossed the lake in longboats with muffled oars and fell upon their rear in the end though aegon's enemies had no answer for his dragons the men of the vale sank a third of the targaryen ships and captured near as many but when queen visenya descended upon them from the sky their own ships burned lord errol fell and buckler hid in their familiar force until queen rhaenys unleashed meraxis and a wall of fire swept through the woods turning the trees to torches and the victors at the wailing willows returning across the lake to harrenhal were ill-prepared when valerion fell upon them out of the morning sky heron's longboats burned so did heron's sons aegon's foes also found themselves plagued by other enemies as argilac the arrogant gathered his swords at storm's end pirates from the stepstones descended on the shores of cape wrath to take advantage of their absence and dornish raiding parties came boiling out of the red mountains to sweep across the marches in the veil young king ronald had to contend with a rebellion on the three sisters when the sister men renounced all legions to the eerie and proclaimed lady marla sunderland their queen yet these were but minor vexations compared to what befell hair in the black though house horror had ruled the riverlands for three generations the men of the trident had no love for the ironborn overlords howard the black had driven thousands to their deaths in the building of his great castle of harrenhal plundering the riverlands for materials and beggaring lords and small folk alike for his appetite for gold so now the riverlands rose against him led by lord edmund tully of riverrun summoned to the defense of harrenhal tully declared for house targaryen instead raised the dragon banner over his castle and rode forth with his knights and archers to join the strength to aegons his defiance gave heart to the other riverlords one by one the lords of the trident renounced heron and declared for aegon the dragon blackwoods malisters vances brackens pipers freys strongs all summoning their levies they descended on harrenhal suddenly outnumbered king heron the black took refuge in a supposedly impregnable stronghold the largest castle ever raised in westeros harrenhal boasted five gargantuan towers an inexhaustible source of fresh water huge subterranean vaults well stocked with provisions and massive walls of black stone higher than any ladder and too thick to be broken by any ram or shattered by any trebuchet harren barred his gates and settled down with his remaining sons and supporters to withstand a siege aegon of dragonstone was of a different mind once he had joined his power with that of edmund tully and the other riverlords to ring the castle he sent a maester to the gates under a peace banner to parlay harren emerged to meet him an old man and grey yet still fierce in his black armor each king had his banner bearer and his maester in attendance so the words that they exchange are still remembered yield now aegon began and you may remain lord of the iron islands yield now and your sons will live to rule after you i have eight thousand men outside your walls what is outside my walls is of no concern to you said harren those walls are strong and thick but not so high is to keep out dragons dragons fly i built in stone said harren stone does not burn to which aegon said when the sun sets your line shall end it is said that harren spat at that and returned to his castle once inside he sent every man of his to the parapets armed with spears and bows and crossbows promising lands and riches to whichever them could bring the dragon down head of your daughter the dragon slayer could claim her hand as well herron the black proclaimed instead i will give him one of tully's daughters or all three if he likes or he may pick one of the black woods whelps or strongs or any girl born of these traitors of the trident these lords of yellow mud then harren the black retired to his tower surrounded by his household guard to sup his remaining sons as the last light of the sun faded black iron's man stared into the gathering darkness clutching their spears and crossbows when no dragon appeared some may have thought that aegon's threats had been hollow but aegon targaryen took valyrian up high through the clouds up and up until the dragon was no bigger than a fly upon the moon only then did he descend well inside the castle's walls on wings as black as pitch valerian plunged through the night and when the great towers of harrenhal appeared beneath him the dragon roared his fury and bathed him at black fire shot through the swirls of red stone does not burn harren had boasted but his castle was not made of stone alone wooden wool hemp and straw bread and salted beef and grain all took fire nowhere herons iron man made of stone smoking screaming shrouded in flames they ran across the yards and tumbled from the wall walks to die upon the ground below and even stone will crack and melt if a fire is hot enough the riverlords outside the castle wall said later that the towers of harrenhal glowed red against the night like five great candles and like candles they began to twist and melt as runnels of molten stone ran down their sides harrod and his last sons died in the fires that engulfed his monstrous fortress that night house horde died with him and so too did the iron islands hold of the riverlands the next day outside the smoking ruins of harrenhal king aegon accepted the oath of fealty from edmund tully lord of riverrun and named him lord paramount of the trident the other riverlords did homage as well to aegon as king and to edmund tully as their liege lord when the ashes had cooled enough to allow men to enter the castle safely the swords of the fallen many shattered melted or twisted into ribbons of steel by dragon fire were gathered up and sent to the egan fort in wagons south and east the storm king's bannermen proved considerably more loyal than king herons argilac the arrogant gathered a great host about him at storm's end the seat of the durandans was a mighty fastness its great curtain wall even thicker than the walls of harrenhal it too was thought to be impregnable to assault word of king herons and soon reached the ears of his old enemy king argilac however lords fell in buckler falling back before the approaching host lord errol had been killed had sent him word of queen rhaenys and her dragon the old warrior king roared that he did not intend to die as harrod had cooked inside his own castle like a suckling pig with an apple in his mouth no stranger to battle he would decide his own fate sword in hand so argilac the arrogant rode forth from storm's end one last time to meet his foes in the open field the storm king's approach was no surprise to orris baratheon and his men queen rhaenys flying miraxis had witnessed argilac's departure from storm's end and was able to give the hand a full accounting of the enemy's numbers and dispositions orris took up his strong position on the hills south of bronze gate and dug in there on the high ground to await the coming of the stormlanders as the armies came together the stormlands proved true to their name a steady rain began to fall that morning and by midday it had turned to a howling gale king argilac's lords bannermen urged him to delay his attack until the next day in hopes the rain would pass but the storm king outnumbered the conquerors almost two to one and had almost four times as many knights and heavy horses the site of the targaryen banner's flapping sadden above his own hills enraged him and the battle-seasoned old warrior did not fail to note that the rain was blowing from the south into the faces of the targaryen men on their hills so argilac the arrogant gave the command to attack and the battle known to history as the last storm began the fighting lasted well into the night a bloody business and far less one-sided than aegon's conquest of harrenhal thrice argilac the arrogant led his knights against the baratheon positions but the slopes were steep and the rains had turned the ground soft and muddy so the war horses struggled and foundered and the charges lost all cohesion and momentum the stormlanders fared better when they sent their spearmen up the hills on foot blinded by the rain the invaders did not see them climbing until it was too late and the wet bow strings of the archers made their bows useless one hill fell and then another and the fourth and final charge of the storm king and his knights broke through the baratheon center only to come upon queen rhaenys and miraxis even on the grounds the dragon proved formidable dicken morrigan and the bastard of black haven commanding the vanguard were engulfed in dragonflame along with the knights of king argilac's personal guard the war horses panicked and fled in terror crashing into riders behind them and turning the charge into chaos the storm king himself was thrown from his saddle yet still argilac continued to battle when ors baratheon came down the muddy hill with his own men he found the old king holding off half a dozen men with as many corpses at his feet stand aside baratheon commanded he dismounted so as to meet the king an equal footing and offered the storm king one last chance to yield argilac cursed him instead and so they fought the old warrior king with his streaming white hair and aegon's fierce bearded hand each man took a wound from the other it was said but in the end the last of the duranding got his wish and died with a sword in his hand and a curse on his lips the death of their king took all heart out of the stormlanders and as the word spread that argilac had fallen his lords and knights threw down their swords and fled for a few days it was feared storm's end might suffer the same fit as harrenhal for argilac's daughter argella barred her gates at the approach of aorus baratheon and the targaryen host and declared herself the storm queen rather than bend the knee the defenders of storm's end would die to the last man she promised when queen rhaenys flew miraxis into the castle to parlay you may take my castle but you will win only bones and blood and ashes she announced but the soldiers of the garrison proved less eager to die that night they raised a peace banner threw open the castle gate and delivered lady argella gagged chained and naked to the camp of aorus baratheon it is said that baratheon unchained her with his own hands wrapped his cloak around her poured her wine and spoke to her gently telling her of her father's courage and the manner of his death and afterward to honor the fallen king he took the arms and words of the durandin for his own the crown's stag became his sigil storm's end became his seat and lady argella his wife with both the riverlands and stormlands now under the control of aegon the dragon and his allies the remaining kings of westeros saw plainly that their own turns were coming at winterfell king tauren called his banners given the vast distances in the north he knew that assembling an army would take time queen char of the vale reaching for her son ronal took refuge in the erie looked to her defenses and sent an army to the bloody gate gateway to the veil of aaron in her youth queen shara had been lauded as the flower of the mountain the fairest maid in all the seven kingdoms perhaps hoping to sway aegon with her beauty she sent him a portrait and offered herself to him in marriage provided he named her son ronald as his heir though the portrait did finally reach him it is not known whether aegon targaryen ever applied to her proposal he had two queens already and shara aaron was then by a faded flower ten years his elder meanwhile the two great western kings had made a common cause and assembled their own armies intent on putting an end to aegon for good and all from high guard in march mirn the ninth of house gardener king of the reach with a mighty host beneath the walls of castle golden grove seat of house rowan he met lauren lannister the first king of the rock leading his own host down from the westerlands together the two kings commanded the mightiest host ever seen in westeros an army 55 000 strong including some 600 lords great and small and more than 5 000 mounted knights our iron fist boasted king mirn his four sons rode beside him and both his young grandsons attended him as squires the two kings did not linger at golden grove a host of such eyes must remain on the march lest it eat the surrounding countryside bear the allies set out at once marching north by northeast through tall grasses and golden fields of wheat advised of their coming in as camp besides the god's eye aegon gathered his own strength and advanced to meet those new foes he commanded only a fifth as many men as the two kings and much of his strength was made up of men sworn to the riverlands whose loyalty to house targaryen was of recent vintage and untested with the smaller host however aegon was able to move much more quickly than his foes at the town of stoney sept both his queens joined him with their dragons rhaenys from storm's end and visenya from crocodile point where she had accepted many fervent pledges of fealty from the local lords together the three targaryens watched from the sky as aegon's army crossed the headwaters of the blackwater rush and raised south the two armies came together amongst the wide open plains south of the blackwater near to where the gold road would run one day the two kings rejoiced when their scouts returned to them and reported targaryen numbers and dispositions they had five men for every one of aegon's it seemed and the disparity in lords and knights was even greater the land was wide and open all grass and wheat as far as the eye could see ideal for heavy horse aegon targaryen would not command the high ground as oars baratheon had at the last storm the ground was firm not muddy nor would they be troubled by rain the day was cloudless though windy there had been no rain for more than a fortnight king mirn had brought half again as many men to the battle as king lauren and so demanded the honor of commanding the center his son and heir edmund was given the vanguard king lauren's knights would form the right lord oakheart the left with no natural barriers to anchor the targaryen line the two kings meant to sweep around aegon on both flanks and then take him in the rear whilst their iron fist a great wedge of armored knights and high lords smashed through aegon's center aegon targaryen drew his own men up in a rough crescent bristling with spears and pikes with archers and crossbowmen just behind and light cavalry on either flank he gave command of his host to john mooton lord of maidenpool one of the first foes to come over to his cause the king himself intended to do his fighting from the sky beside his queens aegon had noted the absence of rain as well the grass and wheat that surrounded the armies was tall and ripe for harvest and very dry the targaryens waited until the two kings sounded their trumpets and started forward beneath the sea of banners king mern himself led the charge against the center on his golden stallion his son gowen beside him with his banner a great green hand upon a field of white roaring and screaming urged on by horns and drums the gardeners and lannisters charged through a storm of arrows down until their foes swimming aside the targaryen spearmen shattering their ranks but by then aegon and his sisters were in the air aegon flew above the ranks of his foes upon valyrian through a storm of spears and stones and arrows swooping down repeatedly to bathe his foes in flame rhaenys and visenya set fires upwind of the enemy and behind them the dry grasses and stands of wheat went up at once the wind fanned the flames and blew the smoke into the faces of the advancing ranks of the two kings the scent of fire sent their mounts into panic and as the smoke thickened horse and rider alike were blinded their ranks began to break as walls of fire rose on every side of them lord newton's men safely upwind of the conflagration waited with their bows and spears and made short work of the burned and burning men who came staggering from the inferno the field of fire the battle was named afterward more than four thousand men died in the flames another thousand perished by sword and spear and arrow tens of thousands suffered burns some so bad that they would remain scarred for life king myrn ix was amongst the dead together with his sons grandsons brothers cousins and other kin one nephew survived for three days when he died of his burns house gardner died with him king loren of the rock lived riding through a wall of flame and smoke to safety when he saw the battle lost the targaryens lost fewer than a hundred men queen visenya took an arrow in one shoulder but soon recovered as the dragons gorged themselves on the dead aegon commanded that the swords of the slain be gathered up and sent down river loren lannister was captured the next day the king of the rock laid his sword and crown at aegon's feet bent the knee and did him homage and aegon true to his promises lifted his beaten foe back to his feet and confirmed him in his lands in lordship naming him lord of casterly rock and warden of the west lord lauren's bannermen followed his example and so too did many of the lords of the reach those who had survived the dragon fire yet the conquest of the west remained incomplete so king aegon parted from his sisters and marched it once for highgarden hoping to secure its surrender before some other claimant could seize it for his own he found the castle in the hands of its steward harlan tyrell whose forebears had served the gardeners for centuries tyrell yielded up the keys to the castle without a fight and pledged his support to the conquering king in reward aegon granted him high guard in all of its domains naming him warden of the south and lord paramount of the mander and giving him dominion over all house gardeners former vassals it was king aegon's intent to continue his march south and enforce the submission of old town the arbor and dorne but whilst at highgarden word of a new challenge came to his ears torren stark king of the north had crossed the neck and entered the riverlands leading an army of savage northmen 30 000 strong aegon at once started north to meet him racing ahead of his army on the wings of valerian the black dread he sent word to his two queens as well and to all lords and knights who had bent the knee to him after harrenhal and the field of fire when torin stark reached the banks of the trident he found a host half again the size of his own awaiting him south of the river riverlords westerman stormlanders men of the reach all had come and above their camp valerian maraxis and vegard prowled the sky in ever-widening circles tauren scouts had seen the ruins of harrenhal where slow red fire still burned beneath the rubble the king in the north had heard many accounts of the field of fire as well he knew that the same fate might await him if he tried to force a crossing of the river some of his lords bannermen urged him to attack all the same insisting that the northern valor would carry the day others urged him to fall back to mokalen and make his stand there on northern soil the king's bastard brother brandon snow offered to cross the trident alone under cover of darkness to slay the dragon whilst they slept king thorne did not send brandon snow across the trident but he crossed with three maesters by his side not to kill but to treat all through the night messages went back and forth the next morning torren stark himself crossed the trident there upon the south bank of the trident he knelt laid the ancient crown of kings of winter at aegon's feet and swore to be his man he rose as lord of winterfell and warden of the north a king no more from that day to this day tauren stark is remembered as the king who knelt but gnome northman left his burned bones beside the trident and the swords aegon collected from lord stark and his vassals were not twisted nor melted nor bent now aegon targaryen and his queens parted company aegon turned south once again marching toward old town whilst his two sisters mounted their dragons visenya for the veil of aaron and rhaenys for sunspear and the deserts of dorne shara aaren had strengthened the defenses of goldtown moved a strong host to the bloody gate and tripled the size of the garrisons in stone snow and sky the way castles that guarded the approach to the eerie all these defenses proved useless against visenya targaryen who rode veigar's leathery wings above them all and landed in the erie's inner courtyard when the region of the vale rushed out to confront her with a dozen guards at her back she found visenya with ronald aaron seated on her knee staring at the dragon wonderstruck mother can i go flying with the lady the boy king asked no threats are spoken no angry words exchanged the two queens smiled at one another and exchanged courtesies instead then lady shara sent for the three crowns her own region's coronet her son's small crown and the falcon crown of mountain and vale that the iron kings had worn for a thousand years and surrendered them to queen vicenja along with the swords of her garrison and it was said afterward that the little king flew thrice about the summit of the giants lance and landed to find himself a little lord thus did visenya targaryen bring the val of aaron into her brother's realm rhaenys targaryen had no such easy conquest a host of dornish spearmen guarded the prince's pass the gateway through the red mountains but rhaenys did not engage them she flew above the pass above the red sands and the white and descended upon vaith to demand its submission only to find the castle empty and abandoned in the town beneath its walls only women and children and old men remained when asked where their lords had gone they would only say away rhaenys followed the river downstream to god's grace seat of house of lyrion but it too was deserted anji flew where the greenblood met the sea rhaenys came upon the planky town where hundreds of pole boats fishing skiffs barges houseboats and hulks sat baking in the sun joined together with ropes and chains and planks to make a floating city yet only a few old women and small children appeared to peer up at her as maraxis circled overhead finally the queen's flight took her to sunspear the ancient seat of house martell where she found the princess of dorne waiting in her abandoned castle miriam martel was 80 years of age the maesters tell us and had ruled the dornish man for 60 of those years she was very fat blind and almost bald her skin sallow and sagging argalak the arrogant had named her the yellow toad of dorne but neither age nor blindness had dulled her wits i will not fight you princess maria told rhaenys nor will i kneel to you dorne has no king tell your brother that i shall rhaenys replied but we will come again princess and the next time we shall come with fire and blood your words said princess miriam ours are unbowed unbent unbroken you may burn us my lady but you will not bend us you will not break us or make us bow this is dawn and you are not wanted here return at your peril thus queen and princess parted and dorn remained unconquered to the west aegon targaryen meant a warmer welcome the greatest city in all of westeros old town was ringed about with massive walls and ruled by the high towers of the hightower the oldest richest and the most powerful of the noble houses of the reach old town was also the center of the faith there dwelt the high septon father of the faithful the voice of the new gods on earth who commanded the obedience of millions of devout throughout the realms save in the north where the old gods still held sway and the blades of the faith militant the fighting order the small folk called the stars and swords yet when aegon targaryen and his host approached old town they found the city gates open and lord hightower wanting to make his submission as it happened when word of aegon's landing first reached old town the high septon had locked himself within the starry sept for seven days and seven nights seeking the guidance of the gods he took no nourishment but bread and water and spent all his waking hours in prayer moving from one altar to the next and on the seventh day the crone had lifted up her golden lamp to show him the path ahead if old town took up arms against aegon the dragon his high holiness saw the city would surely burn and the hightower in the citadel and the starry sept would be cast down and destroyed manfred hightower lord of old town was a cautious lord and godly one of his younger sons served the warrior's sons and another had only recently taken vows as a septon when the high septon told him of the vision vouchsafed him by the crone lord hightower determined that he would not oppose the conqueror by force of arms thus it was no men from old town burned on the field of fire though the hightowers were bannermen of the gardeners of highgarden and thus it was that lord manfred rode forth to greet aegon the dragon as he approached and to offer up his sword his city and his oath some say the lord hightower also offered up the hand of his youngest daughter which aegon declined politely lest it offend his two queens three days later in the starry sept his high holiness himself anointed aegon with the seven oils placed a crown upon his head and proclaimed him aegon of house targaryen the first of his name king of the andals the ruiner and the first men lord of the seven kingdoms and protector of the realm seven kingdoms was the style used though dorne had not submitted nor would it for more than a century to come only a handful of lords had been present for aegon's first coordination at the mouth of the black water but hundreds were on hand to witnesses second and tens of thousands cheered him afterward in the streets of old town as he rode through the city on valerian's back amongst those at aegon's second coronation were the maesters and archmaesters of the citadel perhaps for that reason it was this coronation rather than the aegon fort crowning on the day of aegon's landing that became fixed as the start of aegon's reign thus where the seven kingdoms of westeros hammered into one great realm by the will of aegon the conqueror and his sisters many thought that king aegon would make old town his real seat after the wars were done whilst others thought he would rule from dragonstone the ancient island citadel of house targaryen the king surprised them all by proclaiming his intent to make his court in the new town already rising upon the three hills at the mouth of the blackwater rush where he and his sisters had first set foot on the soil of westeros king's landing the new town would be called from there aegon the dragon would rule his realm holding court from a great metal seat made from the melted twisted beaten and broken blades of all his fallen foes a perilous seat that would soon be known through all the world as the iron throne of westeros
