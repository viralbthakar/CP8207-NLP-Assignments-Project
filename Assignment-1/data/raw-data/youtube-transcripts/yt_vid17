 chapter 11 the long reign jiharis and alisaine policy progeny and pain on the seventh day of the 59th year after aegon's conquest a battered ship came limping up the whispering sound to the port of old town her sails were patched and ragged and salt stained her paint faded and flaking the banner streaming from her mast so sun bleached as to be unrecognizable not until she was tied up at doc was she finally recognized in her sorry state she was the lady meredith last seen departing old town almost three years earlier to cross the sunset sea as our crew began to disembark throngs of merchants porters [ __ ] seamen and thieves gaped in shock nine of every ten men coming ashore were black or brown ripples of excitement ran up and down the docks had the lady meredith indeed crossed the sunset sea were the peoples of the fabled lands of far west all dark-skinned as summer islanders only when sir eustis hightower himself emerged did the whispers die lord donald's grandson was gaunt and sunburned with lines on his face that had not been there when he sailed a handful of old town men were with him all that remained of his original crew one of the grandsire's customs officers met him on the dock and a quick exchange ensued the lady meredith's crew did not simply look like summer islanders they were summer islanders hired on in sethoros as ruinous wages sir eustis complained to replace the men he'd lost he would require porters the captain said his holds were bulging with rich cargo but not from lands beyond the sunset sea that was a dream he said soon enough lord donald's nights turned up with orders to escort him to the hightower there in his grandsire's high hall with a cup of wine in hand so eustis hightower told his tale lord donald's scribe scribbled as he spoke and within days the story had spread all over westeros by messenger bard and raven the voyage had begun as well as he could have hoped so eustis said once beyond the arbor lady westhill had steered her sunchaser south by southwest seeking warmer waters and fair winds and the lady meredith and autumn moon had followed the big bravosi ship was very fast when the wind was in her sails and the high towers had difficulties keeping pace the seven were smiling on us at the start we had the sun by day and the moon by night and as sweet as wind a man unmaid could hope for we were not entirely alone we glimpse fish or folk from time to time and once a great dark ship there could only have been a whaler out of ib and fish so many fish some dolphins swam beside us as if they had never seen a ship before we all thought that we were blessed twelve days of smooth sailing out of westeros the sun chaser and her two companions were as far south as the summer islands according to the best calculations and farther west than any ship had sell before or any ship that had returned to tell the tale of it at least on lady meredith and autumn moon casks of arbor gold were breached to toast the accomplishment on sunchaser the sailors drank a spiced honey wine from lannisport and if any man of them was disquieted that they had not seen a bird for the past four days he held his tongue the gods hate man's arrogance the septons teach us and the seven-pointed star says that pride goes before the fall it may well be that alice westhill and the hightower celebrated too loudly and too early there in the ocean deeps for soon after that grand voyage began to go badly wrong we lost the wind first so eustis told his grandfather's court for almost a fortnight there was not so much as a breeze and the ships moved only so as far as we could tow them it was discovered that a dozen casts of mead on autumn moon were crawling with maggots a small enough thing by itself but an illumine the wind finally returned one day near summer when the sky turned red as blood but the look of it set men to muttering i told them it boded well for us but i lied before morning the stars were gone and the wind began to howl and then the ocean rose that was the first storm sir used to said another followed two days later and then a third each worse than the one before the waves rose higher than our mast and there was a thunder all around and lightning such as i had never seen before great crackling bolts that burned the eyes one struck the otter moon and split a mass from the crow's nest down to the deck in the midst of all that madness one of my hands screamed that he had seen arms rising from the water the last thing any captain needs to hear we had all lost sight of the sun chaser by then all that remained was my lady in the moon the sea was washing over our decks with every rise and fall and men were being swept over to the side clinging uselessly to lines i saw the ottoman found her with my own eyes one moment she was there broken and burning but there then a wave rose up and swallowed her and i blinked and she was gone quick as that that was all it was a wave a monster of a wave but all my men were screaming cracking cracking and not a word i said whatever disabuse them i will never know how we survived that night but we did the next morning the sea was calm again the sun was shining and the water was so blue and innocent a man might never know that it under my brother floated dead with all his men lady meredith was in sad shape sails torn mass splintered nine men amongst the missing we said prayers for the lost and set about making what repairs we could and that afternoon our crow's eye saw sails in the distance it was sun chaser come back to find us lady westhill had done more than simply survive the storm she had found land the winds and raging seas that had separated her sun chaser from the high towers had driven her westward and when the dawn broke her man in the crow's nest had a spied birds circling a hazy mountain peak on the horizon lady alice made toward it and came upon three small islands a mountain attended by two hills as she put it the lady meredith was in no fit shape to sail but with the help of a tow from the three boats off the sunchaser she was able to make the safety of the islands the two battered ships sheltered off the island for more than a fortnight making repairs and replenishing their stores lady alice was triumphant here was land farther to the west than any land had ever been known to be islands that existed on no known chart since there were three of them she named them aegon rhaenys and visenya the islands were uninhabited but springs and streams were plentiful so the voyagers were able to fill their casts with all the fresh water they required there were wild pigs as well and huge sluggish gray lizards as big as deer and trees heavy with nuts and fruit after sampling some of those eustis hightower declared that they had no need to go any farther this is discovery enough he said we have spices here i've never tasted and these pink fruits we have our fortunes here in our hands alice westhill was incredulous three small islands even the largest of them a third of the size of dragonstone that was nothing the true wonders lay farther west there might be another essos just beyond the horizon oh there might be another thousand leagues of empty ocean sir eustis replied and though lady alice cajoled and pleaded and wove webs of words in the air she cannot move him even if i had wished to my crew would not allow it he told lord donald hightower to a man they were convinced they had seen a giant kraken pool autumn moon beneath the sea had i given the command to sail on they would have fed me to the waves and found another captain so the voyagers had parted ways as they left the islands lady meredith turned back east for home whilst alice westhill and her son chase are pressed onward chasing the sun eustis hightower's voyage home would prove to be nigh as perilous as his voyage out had been there were more storms to be weathered though none as terrible as the one that had claimed his brother's ship the prevailing winds were against them forcing them to tack and tack again they had taken three of the great grey lizards on board and one bit his steersman whose leg turned green and had to be removed a few days later they encountered a pod of leviathans one of them a huge white bull larger than a ship had slammed into lady meredith of a purpose and cracked her hull afterward sir eustace had changed course making for the summer islands which he figured to be their nearest landfall they were farther south than they had realized however and ended up missing the islands entirely and fetching up instead upon the coast of sothoros we were there a full year he told his grandsire trying to make lady meredith seaworthy again for the damage was greater than we thought there were fortunes to be had there as well though and we were not blind to that emeralds gold spices eye all that and more strange creatures monkeys that walk like men men that howl like monkeys wyverns basilisks a hundred different sorts of snakes deadly all of them some of my men just vanished overnight the ones who didn't began to die one was bitten by a fly a little prick upon his neck nothing to fear three days later his skin was slogging off and he was bleeding from his ears and [ __ ] and arse drinking salt while they will make a man mad every sailor knows that but the fresh water is no safer in that place there are worms in it almost too small to see if you swallow them they lay their eggs inside you and the fevers hardly a day went when half my men were fit to work we all would have perished i think but some summer islanders passing by came on us they know that hell better than they let on i think with the help i was able to get lady meredith to tall trees town and from there to home there ended his tale and his great adventure as for lady house westhill born elisa of house farmin where her adventure ended we cannot say the sun chaser vanished into the west still searching for lands beyond the sunset sea and was never seen again except many years later corliss velaryon the boy born on driftmark in 53ac would take his ship the sea snake on nine graded voyages sailing farther than any man of westeros had ever sailed before on the first of those voyages he sailed beyond jade gates to yiti and the isle of lange and returned with such wealth of spice and silk and jade that house velaryon became for a time the wealthiest house in the seven kingdoms on a second voyage sir corliss sailed even farther east and became the first westerosi ever to reach a shy by the shadow the bleak black city of the shadow binders at the edge of the world there he lost his love and half his crew if the tales to be true and there as well in asshai's harbor he glimpsed an old and much-weathered ship that he would swear forevermore could only have been sunchaser in 59 ac however corliss velaryon was a boy of six dreaming of the sea so he must leave him and turn back once again to the autumn in that fateful year when the skies darkened the winds rose and the winter came again in westeros the winter of 59 to 60 ac was an exceptionally cruel one all those who survived it agreed the north was hit first and hardest as crops died in the field streams froze and bitter winds came howling over the wall lord o'lark stark had commanded that half of every harvest be preserved and put aside against the coming winter not all his bannermen had obeyed as their larders and granaries emptied famine spread across the land and old men bathed farewell to their children and went out into the snow to die so their kin might live harvest failed in the riverlands the westerlands and the vale as well and even down into the reach those who had food began to hoard and all across the seven kingdoms the price of bread began to rise the price of meat rose even faster and in towns and cities fruits and vegetables all but disappeared and then the shivers came and the stranger walked the land they had seen it's like before a century ago and the course of the contagion was written in their books it was believed to have come to westeros from across the sea from one of the free cities or lands more distant still port cities and harbor towns always felt the hand of the disease first and hardest many of the small folk believed that it was carried by rats not the familiar grey rats of king's landing in old town big and bold and vicious but the smaller black rats that could be seen swarming from the holds of ships at dock and scurrying down the ropes that held them fast though the guild of rats was never proved to the satisfaction of the citadel suddenly every house in the seven kingdoms from the grandest castle to the humblest hut required a cat before the shivers ran its course that winter kittens were selling for as much as destroyers the marks of the disease were well known it began simply enough with a chill victims would complain of being cold throw a fresh log on the fire huddle under a blanket or a pile of furs some would call for hot soup mulled wine or against all reason beer neither blankets nor soups could stay the progress of the pestilence soon the shivering would begin mild at first a trembling a shudder but inexorably growing worse goose prickles would march up and down the victim's limbs like conquering armies by then the afflicted would be shivering so violently that their teeth would shatter and their hands and feet would begin to convulse and twitch when the victim's lips turned blue and he began to cough up blood the end was nigh once the first chill was felt the course of the shivers was swift death could come within day and no more than one victim and every five recovered all this the maesters knew what they did not know is where the shivers came from how to stop it or how to cure it poultices were tried and potions hot mustards and dragon peppers were suggested and wine spiced with snake venom that made the lips go numb the afflicted were immersed in tubs of hot water some heated almost to the point of boiling green vegetables were said to be a cure then raw fish then red meat the bloodier the better certain healers dispensed with the meat and advised their patients to drink blood various smokes and inhalations of burning leaves were tried one lord commanded his men to build fires all around him surrounding himself with walls of flame in the winter of 59 ac the shivers entered from the east and moved across the blackwater bay and upped the blackwater rush even before king's landing the islands off the crown lines felt the chill edwell celtigar maegor's one-time hand and the much-despised master of coin was the first lord to die his son and heir followed him to the grave three days later lord staunton died at rook's rest and then his wife their children frightened sealed themselves into the bed chambers and barred the doors but it did not save them on dragonstone the queen's beloved septa edith perished on driftmark damon velaryon lord of the tides recovered after being at the point of death but his second son and three of his daughters were born away lord bar emin lord rosby lady jyrelle of maidenpool the bells told for them all and many lesser men and women besides all across the seven kingdoms the noble and humble alike were struck down the old and the young were most at risk but men and women in the prime of their lives were not spared the role of those taken included the greatest of lords the noblest of ladies and the most valiant of knights lord prentice tully died shivering in riverrun followed a day later by his lady lucinda lyman lannister the mighty lord of casually rock was taken together with sundry of other lords of the westerlands lord mar brand of ashmark lord tarbeck of tarbach hall lord westerling of the crag at highgarden lord tyrell sickened but survived only to perish drunk in a fall from his horse four days after his recovery rogar baratheon was untouched by the shivers and his son and daughter by queen elissa were stricken but recovered yet his brother ronald died and the wives of both his brothers the great port city of old town was especially hard hit losing a quarter of its population eustis hightower who had returned alive from alice westhill's ill-fated voyage across the sunset sea survived once again but his wife and children were not as fortunate nor was his grandsire lord of the hightower donald the delayer could not delay death he died shivering so did the high septon two score of the most devout and fully a third of the archmaesters maesters acolytes and novices at the citadel in all the realm no place was as sorely afflicted as king's landing was in 59 ac amongst the dead were two knights of the kingsguard old sir sam of sour hill and the good-hearted victor the valiant along with three lords of the council alvin massey carl corbray and the grand maester benefer himself benefer had served 15 years through times both perilous and prosperous coming to the red keep after maker the cruel had decapitated his three immediate predecessors an act of singular courage or singular stupidity his sardonic successor would observe i would not have lasted three days under maegor all the dead would be mourned and missed but in the immediate aftermath of their passing the loss of carl corbrey was felt most grievously with their commander dead and many of the city watched stricken and shivering the streets and alleys of king's landing fell prey to lawlessness and license shops were looted women raped men robbed and killed for no crime but walking down the wrong street at the wrong time king jiharis sent forth his kingsguard and his household knights to restore order but they were too few and he soon had no choice but to call them back amidst the chaos his grace would lose another one of his lords not to the shivers but to ignorance and hate rhaego draz had never taken up residence in the red keep though there was ample room for him there and the king had made the offer many times the pentoshi preferred his own mance on the street of silk with the dragon pit looming above him atop the hill of rhaenys there he could entertain his concubines without suffering the disapproval of the court after 10 years of service to the iron throne lord rhaego had grown quite stout and no longer chose to ride instead he moved from mance to castle and back again in an ornate gilded palanquin unwisely his root took him through the wreaking heart of flea bottom the foulest and most lawless district of the city on that dire day a dozen of flea bottoms less savory denizens were chasing a piglet down an alley when they chanced to come upon lord rago moving through the streets some were drunk and all were hungry the piglet had escaped them and the sight of the pentoshi enraged them for to a man they held the master of coin to blame for the high cost of bread one wore a sword three had knives and the rest snatched up stones and sticks and swarmed the palaquin driving off lord rhaego's bearers and spilling his lordship onto the ground onlookers said he screamed for help in words none of them could understand he's fentoshi them's the bastards brung the shivers here one of the men pried a stone up from the king's newly cobbled street and brought it down upon lord rago's head again and again until only a red mash of blood and bone and brains remained thus died the lord of air his skull crushed by one of the very cobblestones he had helped the king lay down even then his assailants were not done with him before they ran they ripped off his fine clothes and cut off all his fingers to lay claim to his rings when word reached the red keep jairus targaryen himself rode forth to claim the body surrounded by his kingsguard so roth his grace at what he had saw that sir jeffrey doggett would say afterward when i looked upon his face for a moment it was as if i were looking at his uncle the street was full of the curious come out to see their king or gaze upon the bloody corpse the pentoshi money changer jiharis wheeled his horse about and shouted at them i would have the name of the men who did this speak now and you will be well rewarded hold your tongues and you will lose them many of the watchers slunk away but one barefoot girl came forward squeaking out a name the king thanked her and commanded her to show his knights where this man be found she led the kingsguard to a wine sink where the villain was discovered with a [ __ ] in his lap and three a lord rhaego's rings on his fingers under torture he soon gave up the names of the other attackers and they were taken one and all one of their number claimed to have been a poor fellow and cried out that he wished to take the black no jiharis told him the night's watch are men of honor and you are lower than rats such men as these were unworthy of a clean death by sword or axe he ruled instead they were hung from the walls of the red keep disembowelled and left to twist until they died their entrails swinging loose down to their knees the girl who had led the king to the killers had a kinder fate taken in hand by queen alisane she was plunged into a tub of hot water for a scrubbing her clothes were burned her head was shaved and she was fed hot bread and bacon there is a place for you in the castle if you want it alisaine told her when her belly was full in the kitchens or the stables as you wish do you have a father the girl gave a shy nod and admitted that she did he was one of them bellies you cut open the boxy one with the sty then she told her grace that she wanted to work in the kitchens that's where they keep the bread the old year ended and a new year began but there were a few celebrations anywhere in westeros to mark the coming of the 60th year since aegon's conquest a year before great bonfires had been lit in public squares and men and women had danced around them drinking and laughing while spells rang in the new year one year later the fires were consuming corpses and the bells were tolling out the dead the streets of king's landing were empty especially by night the alleyways were deep in snow and icicles hung down from the rooftops long as spears atop aegon's high hill king jaharis ordered the gates of the red keep closed and barred and doubled the watch on the castle walk he and his queen and their children attended sunset services at the castle sept prepared to maegor's holdfast for a modest meal and then retired to bed it was the hour of the out when queen alisain was awoken by her daughter shaking her gently by the arm mother princess daenerys said i'm cold there is no need to dwell on all that followed daenerys targaryen was the darling of the realm and all that could be done for any man was done for her there were prayers and poultices hot soups and scolding baths blankets and furs and hot stones nettle tea the princess was six and years past being weaned but a wet nurse was summoned for there were some who believed that mother's milk could cure the shivers maesters came and went septons and septas prayed the king commanded that a few hundred new rat catchers be hired at once and offered a silver stag for every dead rat gray or black daenerys wanted her kitten and her kitten was brought to her though as her shivering grew more violent it squirmed from her grasp and scratched her hand near dawn jeharis bolted to his feet shouting that a dragon was needed that his daughter must have a dragon and ravens took wing for dragonstone instructing the dragon keepers there to bring a hatchling to the red keep at once none of it mattered a day and a half after she had woken her mother from sleeping complaining of feeling cold the little princess was dead the queen collapsed in the king's arms shaking so violently that some feared she had the shivers too jiharis had her taken back to her own chambers and given milk of the poppy to help her sleep though near exhaustion he went next to the yard and loosed vermathor then flew to dragonstone to tell them there was no need for hatchling after all on his return to king's landing he drank a cup of dream wine and sent for septum barth how could this happen he demanded what sin did she commit why would the gods take her how could this happen but even barth that wise man had no answers for him the king and queen were not the only parents to lose a child to the shivers thousands of others highborn and low knew the same pain that winter for joharis and alisaine however the death of their beloved daughter must have seemed especially cruel for it struck at the very heart of the doctrine of exceptionalism princess daenerys had been targaryen on both sides with the blood of old valeria running pure through her veins and those of valyrian descent were not like other men targaryens had purple eyes and hair of gold and silver they ruled the sky on dragons the doctrines of faith and prohibitions against incest did not apply to them and they did not get sick since anar the exile first staked his claim to dragonstone that had been known targaryens did not die of pox or the bloody flux they were not afflicted with red spots or brown leg or the shaking sickness they would not succumb to worm bone or clotted lung or sour gutter any of the myriad pestilences and contagions that the gods for the reasons of their own see fit to loose on mortal men and women there was fire in the blood of the dragon it was reasoned a purifying fire that burned out all such plagues it was unthinkable that a pure born princess should die shivering as if she were some common child and yet she had even as they mourned for her and the sweet soul that she had been jayharrison alisaine must also have been confronting that awful realization may happens the targaryens were not so close to gods as they had believed mayhaps in the end they too were only men when the shivers finally ran its course king jaharis went back to his labors with a sadder heart his first task was a grim one replacing all the friends and counselors he had lost lord manfred redwine's eldest son sir robert was named to command the city watch sir giles morrigan brought forth two good nights to join the kingsguard and his grace duly presented sir ryan redwine and sir robin shaw with white cloaks the abel alvin massey his bent-backed justice shar was not so easily replaced to fill his seat the king reached out to the veil of aaron and summoned roderick aaron the arudi young lord of the eerie who he and the queen first met as a boy of ten the citadel had already sent him benefit's successor the sharp-tunned grand maester elisar 20 years younger than the man whose chain he donned elisar had never had a thought he didn't feel the need to share some claimed that the conclave had sent him to king's landing to be rid of him jaharis hesitated longus when it came to selecting his new lord treasurer and master of coin rhaego draws however despised had been a man of great ability i am tempted to say you do not find such men lying about in the streets but if truth be told we are more like to find one there than sitting in some castle the king told his counsel the lord of heir had never married but he did have three bastard sons who had learned his business at his knee much as the king was tempted to reach out to one of them he knew the realm would never accept another pentoshi it must need to be a lord he concluded gloomily familiar names were bandied once again lannister valerion hightower houses built on gold as much as steel they are all too proud jaharis said if septon barth who first proposed a different name the tyrells of highgarden are descended from stewards he reminded the king but the reach is broader than the westerlands with a different sort of wealth and young martin tyrell might prove a useful addition to this council lord redwine was incredulous the tyrell's adults he said i am sorry grace they are my liege lords but the tyrell's adults and lord bertrand was assault as well that is as it may be septic barth admitted lord bertrand is in his grave now however and i'm speaking of his son martin is young and eager but i will not vouch for the quality of his wits his wife however is a fast away girl the lady florence who has been counting apples since she learned to walk she has been keeping all accounts at higher garden since her marriage and it is said she has increased house tyrell's incomes by a third should we appoint her husband she would come to court as well i do not doubt hallisane would like that the king said she enjoys the company of clever women the queen had not been attending council since the death of princess daenerys mayhap's jiharis hoped that this would help bring her back to him again our good septon has never led us wrong let us try the adult with the clever wife and hope that my illegal small folk do not beat his head in with a cobblestone the seven take and the seven give me apps the mother above looked down on queen alisain in her grief and took pity on her broken heart her grace learned that she was once again carrying a child with winter holding the realm in its icy grip the queen once again chose caution and retired to dragonstone for her lying in later that year 60 ac she was delivered of her fifth child a daughter she named alyssa after her mother an honor her grace would have appreciated more had she been alive observed the new grand maester elisar though not in the king's hearing winter broke not long after the queen gave birth and alyssa proved to be a lively healthy child as a babe she was so like her late sister daenerys that the queen oft wept to behold her remembering the child she had lost the likeness faded as the princess grew older however long-faced and skinny alyssa had little of her sister's beauty her hair was a dirty blonde tangle with no hint of silver to evoke the dragonlords of old and she had been born with mismatched eyes one violet and the other startling green her ears were too big and her smile lopsided and when she was six playing in the yard a whack across the face from a wooden sword broke her nose it healed crooked but alyssa did not seem to care by that age her mother had come to realize that it was not daenerys that she took after but baylon just as balon had once followed aemon everywhere alyssa trailed after baylon like a poppy the spring prince complained balon was two years younger than ayman alyssa nearly four years younger than him and a girl which made it far worse in his eyes the princess did not act like a girl however she wore boys clothes when she could shun the company of other girls preferred riding and climbing and dueling with wooden swords to sewing and reading and singing and refused to eat porridge an old friend and old adversary returned to king's landing in 61ac when lord rogar baratheon rode up from storm's end to deliver three young girls to court two were the daughters of his brother ronal who had died shivering together with his wife and sons third was lady jocelyn his lordship's own daughter by queen elissa the small frail babe who had come into the world during that terrible year of the stranger had grown into a tall young girl of solemn mine with large dark eyes and hair black as sin rogar baratheon's own hair had gone gray however and the years had taken their toll on the old king's hand his face was pale and lined and he had grown so gone that his clothes hung loose upon him as if they had been cut for a much larger man when he took a knee before the iron throne he had trouble rising back to his feet and required the help of a kingsguard to stand he had come to ask a boon lord rogar told the king and queen lady jocelyn would soon be celebrating her seventh name day she has never known her mother my brother's wives looked after her as much as they were able but they favor their own children as mothers will and now both of them are gone if it please you sires i would ask you except jocelyn and her cousins as wards to be raised here caught beside your own sons and daughters it would be our honor and our pleasure queen alisane replied jocelyn is our own sister we have not forgotten our blood lord rogar seemed relieved i would ask you to look after my son as well bormans will remain at storm's end in charge of my brother garen he's a good boy a strong boy and he will be a great lord in time i do not doubt but he is only nine as your graces know my brother boris left the stormland some years ago he grew sour and angry after a bulman was born and things went from bad to worse between us boris was in mir for a time and later in volantis doing god's nose but now he has turned up in westeros again in the red mountains the talk is that he's joined up with a vulture king and is raiding his own people garen is an able man and leo but he never was matched for boris and borman is but a boy i fear for what may befall him and the stormlands when i am gone that took the king of back when are you gone why should you be gone and what do you mean to go my lord lord rogar's answering smile showed a glimpse of his old ferocity into the mountains your grace my maester says that i am dying i believe him even before the shivers there was pain it has gotten worse since he gives me milk of the poppy and that helps but i use only a little i would not sleep away what life remains of me nor would i die a bed bleeding out of my arse i mean to find my brother boris and deal with him and with his vulture king as well a fool's errand garen calls it he's not wrong but when i die i want to die with my axe in my hand scream here curse do i have your leave your grace moved by his old friend's words king jeharis rose and descended from the iron throne to clap lord rogar by the shoulder your brother is a traitor and this vulture i will not call him king has vexed our marches long enough you have my leaf my lord and more than that you have my sword the king was true to his word the fight that followed is named in histories as the third dornish war but that is a misnomer for the prince of dorne kept his armies well out of the conflict the small folk of the time called it lord rogar's war and the name is far more apt whilst the lord of storm's end led 500 men into the mountains jaehaerys targaryen took to the air on vermathor he calls himself a vulture the king said but he does not fly he hides he should call himself the gopher he was not wrong the first vulture king had commanded armies leading thousands of men into battle the second was no more than followers who shared his taste of robbery and rape he knew the mountains well however and when pursued he would simply disappear to reappear at will men who came hunting him did so at their peril for he was skilled at ambiscade as well none of his tricks availed him against a foe who could hunt him from above however legend claimed the vulture king had an impregnable mountain fastness hidden in the clouds jaharis found no secret lair only a dozen rude camps scattered here and there one by one vermathor flamed them all leaving the vulture only ashes to return to lord rogar's column winding their way into the heights were soon forced to abandon their horses and proceed on foot along the goat tracks up steep slopes and through caves whilst hidden foes rolled stones down about their heads yet still they came on undaunted as the stormlanders proceeded from the east simon dondarrion lord of blackhaven led a small host of marcher knights into the mountains from the west to seal off escape from that side whilst the hunters crept toward one another jiharis watched them from the sky moving them about as once he had moved toy armies in the chamber of the painted table in the end they found their foes boris baratheon did not know the mountain's hidden ways as the dornish did so he was the first to be cornered lord rogar's men made short work of his own but as the brothers came face to face king jiharis descended from the sky i would not have you named a kinslayer my lord his grace told his former hand the traitor is mine sir boris laughed to hear it rather name me a kingslayer than him a kinslayer he shouted as he rushed the king but jiharis had black fire in hand and he had not forgotten the lessons he had learned in the yard on dragonstone forest baratheon died at the king's feet from a cut to his neck that near took off his head the vulture king's turn came the new full moon brought to bay in a burned lair where he had hoped to find refuge he resisted to the end showering the king's men with spears and arrows this one is mine rogue baratheon told his grace when the mountain king was led before them in fetters at his command the outlaw's chains are struck off and he was given a spear and shield lord rogar faced him with his axe if he kills me let him go free the vulture proved sadly unequal to the task wasted and weak and racked with pain as he was rogar baratheon turned the dornishman's attacks aside contemptuously then clove him from shoulder to navel when it was done lord rogar seemed weary it seems that i will not die with an axe in hand after all he told the king sadly nor did he rogar baratheon lord of storm's end and one time hand of the king and lord protector of the realm died at storm's end half a year later in the presence of his maester his septon his brother sargaran and his son and heir bormund lord rogar's war had lasted less than half a year begun and won entirely in 61 ac with the vulture king eliminated raiding fell off sharply along the dornish marches for a time as accounts of the campaign spread through the seven kingdoms even the most martial of lords gained a new respect for the young king any lingering doubts have been dispelled jiharis targaryen was not his father aines for the king himself the war was healing against the shivers i was helpless he confessed to septon barth against the vulture i was a king again in 62ac the lords of the seven kingdom rejoiced when king jiharis conferred upon his eldest the title of prince of dragonstone making him the acknowledged heir to the iron throne prince eamonn was seven years of age a boy as tall and as handsome as he was modest he still trained every morning in the yard with prince balon the two brothers were fast friends and evenly matched eamonn was taller and stronger balon quicker and fiercer their contests were so spirited that they offed through crowds of onlookers serving men and washer women household knights and squires maesters and septons and stable boys they would gather in the yard to cheer on one prince or the other one of those who came to watch was jocelyn baratheon the late queen alyssa's dark-haired daughter who grew taller and more beautiful with every passing day at the feast that followed eamon's investiture as prince of dragonstone the queen sat lady jocelyn next to him and the two young people were observed talking and laughing together through the evening to the exclusion of all others that same year the gods blessed jaharis and alisain with yet another child a daughter they named miguel a gentle selfless and sweet natured girl and exceedingly bright she soon attached herself to sister alisa in much the same way that prince balon had attached himself to prince aemon though not entirely as happily now it was alyssa's turn to bristle at having the baby clinging to her skirts she evaded her the best she could and baylon laughed at her fury we have already touched upon several of jiharis's achievements as 62ac drew near its end the king looked ahead to the year donning and all the years beyond and began to make plans for a project that would transform the seven kingdoms he had given king's landing cobblestone streets cisterns and fountains now he lifted his eyes beyond the city walls to the fields and hills and bogs that stretch from the dornish marches to the gift my lords he told the council when the queen and i go forth on our progresses we go on vermethor and silverwing when we look down from the clouds we see cities and castles hills and swamps rivers and streams and lakes we see market towns and fishing villages old forests mountains moors and meadows flocks of sheep and fields of grain old battlefields ruined towards lichards and sepps there is much and more to see in the seven kingdoms of ours do you know what i do not see the king slapped the table roads my lords i do not see roads i see some ruts if i fly low enough i see some game trails and here and there a footpath by the stream but i do not see any proper roads my lords i will have roads the building of so many leagues of road would continue throughout the rest of jaharis's reign and into the reign of a successor but it started that day in the council chambers of the red keep let it not be thought that there were no roads in westeros before his reign hundreds of roads crisscrossed the land many dating back thousands of years to the days of first men even the children of the forest had paths they followed when they moved from place to place beneath the trees yet the roads as they existed were abysmal narrow muddy rutted crooked they wandered through hills and woods and over streams without plan or purpose only a handful of those streams were bridged river forts were often guarded by men at arms who demanded coin or kind for the right to cross some of the lords whose lands the roads pass through maintain them for after a fashion but many more did not a rainstorm would wash them out robber knights and broken men preyed upon the travelers who used them before maegor the poor fellows would provide a certain amount of protection to common folk upon the roads when they were not robbing them themselves after the destruction of the stars the realms byways became more dangerous than ever even great lords traveled with an escort to correct all these ills in a single reign would have been impossible but jaharis was determined to make a start king's landing it must be remembered was a very young as cities go before aegon the conqueror and his sisters had come ashore to dragonstone only a modest fishing village stood on the three hills where the blackwater rush flowed into blackwater bay not surprisingly few roads of any note began or end in the modest fishing villages the city had grown quickly in the 62 years since aegon's conquest and a few rude roads had sprung up with it narrow dusty tracks that followed the shore up to stokeworth rossby and duskendale or cut through the hills to meet him pool aside from that there was nothing no roads connected the king's seat with the great castles and cities of the land king's landing was a port far more accessible by sea than land that was where jiharis would begin the woods south of the river was old forest dense and overgrown fine for hunting poor for travel he commanded that a road be cut through it to connect king's landing with storm's end the same road should be continued north of the city from the rush to the trident and beyond straight along the green fork and through the neck then across the wild trackless north to winterfell and the wall the king's road the small folk named it the longest and most costly of jaharis's roads the first begun the first completed others followed the roads road the ocean road the river road the gold road some had existed for centuries in rooter form but jiharis would remake them beyond all recognition filling ruts spreading gravel bridging streams other roads his men created anew the cost of all this was not inconsiderable to be sure but the realm was prosperous and the king's new master of coin martin tyrell aided and abetted by his clever wife the apple counter proved almost as able as the lord of air had been mile by mile league by league the roads grew for decades to come he bound the lands together and made of seven kingdoms one read the words on the plinth of the old king's monument that stands at the citadel of old town mayhaps the seven smiled on his work as well for they continued to bless jaharis and alisain with children in 63 ac the king and queen celebrated the birth of aegon their third son and seventh child a year later came another daughter daela three years hence princess sarah came into the world red-faced and squalling another princess arrived in 71ac when the queen gave birth to her 10th child and sixth daughter the beautiful vicera though born within a decade of one another it would be hard to conceive of four siblings so different from one another as these younger children of jaeharys and alisene prince vegan was as unlike his elder brothers as night to day never robust he was a quiet boy with wary eyes other children and even some of the lords of the court found him sour though no coward he took no pleasure in the rough play of the squires and pages or the heroics of his father's nights he preferred the library to the yard and could often be found their reading princess dialla the next oldest was delicate and shy easily frightened and quick to cry she did not speak her first word until she was almost two and even thereafter she was tongue-tied more often not her sister miguel became her guiding star and she worshipped her mother the queen but her sister alyssa seemed to terrify her and she blushed and hit her face in the presence of the older boys princess sarah three years younger was a trial from the very start tempestuous demanding disobedient the first word she spoke was no and she said it so often and loudly she refused to be weaned until past the age of four even as she ran about the castle talking more than her siblings vagon and daela combined she wanted her mother's milk and raged and screamed whenever the queen dismissed another wet nurse seven save us alisone whispered to the kings one night when i look at her i see arya fierce and stubborn sarah targaryen thrived upon the attention and sulked when she did not receive it the youngest of the four princess visera had a will of her own as well but she never screamed and certainly never cried sly was one word used to describe her vain was another visera was beautiful all men agreed blessed with the deep purple eyes and the silver gold hair of a true targaryen with flawless white skin fine features and a grace that was somehow eerie and unsettling in one so young when one stammering young squire told her she was a goddess she agreed we shall return to these four princelings and the woes they visited upon their mother and their father in due time but for the nonce let us take a step back to 68 ac not long after the birth of princess sarah when the king and queen announced the betrothal of their firstborn son eamonn prince of dragonstone to jocelyn baratheon of storm's end there had been some thought after the tragic death of princess daenerys that eamonn should wed princess elissa the eldest of his remaining sisters but queen alisaine firmly put the thought aside alyssa is for baelon she declared she has been following him around since she could walk they're as close as you and i were at their age two years later in 70ac eamonn and jocelyn were joined in a ceremony that rivaled the golden wedding for its splendor lady jocelyn at 16 years old was one of the great beauties of the realm a long-legged full-breasted maid with thick straight hair that fell to her waist black as a raven's wing prince eamonn was one year younger at 15 but all agreed that they made a handsome couple an inch shy of six feet tall jocelyn would have towered over most of the lords of westeros but the prince of dragonstone had three inches on her there stands the future of the realm sir gals morrigan said when he beheld the two of them side by side the dark lady and the pale prince in 72ac attorney was held at duskendale in honor of young lord darklin's wedding to a daughter of theomore manderly both of the young princes attended together with their sister alyssa and competed in the squire's melee prince eamon emerged victorious in part by dint of hammering his brother into submission later he distinguished himself in the lists as well and was awarded his night spurs in recognition of his skills he was 17 years of age with knighthood now achieved the prince wasted no time becoming a dragon rider as well ascending into the sky for the first time not long after his return to king's landing his mount was blood red caraxes fiercest of all the young dragons in the dragon pit the dragon keepers who knew the denizens of the pit better than anyone called him the bloodworm elsewhere in the realm 72 ac also marked the end of an era in the north with the passing of a lark stark lord of winterfell both of the strong sons he had boasted of had died before him so it fell to his grandson edric to succeed him wherever prince eamonn went whatever prince eamonn did prince balon would not be far behind as the wags at court oft observed the truth of that was proved in 73 ac when balon the brave followed his brother into knighthood eamonn had won his spurs at 17 so balon must needs do the same at 16 traveling across the reach to old oak where lord oakhart was celebrating the birth of a son with seven days of jousting a raid as a mystery knight and calling himself the silver fool the young prince overthrew lord rowan sir allen ashford both fossaway twins and lord oakhart's own heir sir dennis before falling to sir rickard redwine after helping him to his feet sir rickard unmasked him bait him neal and knighted him on the spot prince balon lingered only long enough to partake of the feast that evening before galloping back to king's landing to complete his quest and become a dragon rider never one to be overshadowed he had long since chosen the dragon he wished to mount and now he claimed her unridden since the death of the dowager queen visenya 29 years before the great she-dragon veigar spread her wings roared and launched herself once more into the skies carrying the spring prince across blackwater bay to dragonstone to surprise his brother eamonn and karaxis the mother above has been so good to me to bless me with so many babes all bright and beautiful queen alison declared in 73 ac when it was announced that her daughter miguel would be joining the faith as a novice it is only fitting that i give one back princess miguel was 10 years of age and eager to take the vows a quiet studious girl she was said to read from the seven-pointed star every night before sleep hardly had one child departed from the red keep then another arrived however for it appeared that the mother above was not yet done blessing alisain targaryen in 73 ac she gave birth to her 11th child a son named gaiman in honor of gaming the glorious the greatest of the targaryen lords who had ruled on dragonstone before the conquest this time however the child came early after a long and difficult labor that exhausted the queen and made her maesters fear for her life gaiman was a scrawny thing as well barely half the size of his brother vagon had been at birth 10 years earlier the queen eventually recovered though sad to say the child did not prince gaiman died a few days into the new year not quite three moons old as ever the queen took the loss of a child hard questioning whether or not it had been through some fault of her own that prince gaiman had failed septa lira her confidant since her days on dragonstone assured her that she was not to blame the little prince is with the mother above now lyra told her and she will care for him better than we could ever hoped to here in this world of strife and pain that was not the only sorrow house targaryen was to suffer in 73 ac it'll be remembered that this was also the year that queen reina died at harrenhal next year's end a shameful revelation came to light that shocked both court and city the amiable and well-loved sir lockamore strong of the kingsguard a favorite of the small folk was found to have been secretly wed despite the vows that he had sworn as a white sword worse he had taken not one but three wives keeping each woman ignorant of the other two and fathering no fewer than 16 children on the three of them in flea bottom and along the street of silk where [ __ ] and pendants plied their trade men and women of low birth and lower morals took a wicked pleasure in the fall of an anointed night and made body japes about sir luckamore the lusty but no laughter was hurt in the red keep jaehaerus and alisain had been especially fond of sir luckamore strong and were mortified to learn that he had played them both for fools but his brothers in the kingsguard were even angrier it was sariam redwine who discovered sir luckamore's transgressions and brought them to the attention of the lord commander of the kingsguard who in turn brought them to the king speaking for his sworn brothers sir guiles morrigan declared that strong had dishonored all they stood for and requested that he'd be put to death when dragged before the iron throne sir luckamore fell to his knees confessed his guilt and begged the king for mercy jaharis might well have granted him same but the errant knight made the fatal error of appending for the sake of my wives and children to his plea a septon barth observed this was tantamount to throwing his crimes in the king's face when i rose against my uncle maegor two of his kingsguard abandoned him to fight for me jaharis responded they might well have believed that they would be allowed to keep their white cloaks once i'd won perhaps even be honored with lordships and a higher place in the court i sent them to the wall instead i wanted no oath breakers around me then or now said luckamore you swore a sacred vow before gods and mend to defend me and mine with your own life to obey me fight for me die for me if need be you also saw to take no wife father no children and remain chaste if you could shrug aside the second vow so easily why should i believe you would honor the first then queen alizene spoke up saying you made a mockery of your own oaths as a knight of the kingsguard but those were not the only vows you broke you dishonored your marriage vows as well not once but thrice none of these women are lawfully wed so these children i see behind you are bastards one and all they are the true innocence of this sir your wives were ignorant of one another i am told but each of them must surely have known you were a white sword a knight of the king's god to that extent they share your guilt as does whatever drunk inception you found to marry you for them some mercy may be warranted but for you i will not have you near my lord sir there was no more to be said as the false night's wives and children wept or cursed or stood in silence jaehaerys commanded that sir luckamore be gelded forth with then clapped in irons and sent off to the wall the night's watch will require vows from you as well his grace warned see that you keep them or the next thing you lose shall be your head jiharis left it to his queen to deal with the three families alisayne decreed that her luck-amore sons might join the father on the wall if they wished the two oldest boys chose to do so the girls would be accepted as novices by the faith if that was their desire only one elected that path the other children were to remain with their mothers the first of the wives with her children was given over to the charge of the luckmore's brother bywin who had been raised to be the lord of harrenhal not half a year earlier the second wife and her offspring would go to driftmart to be fostered by damon velaryon lord of the tides the third wife whose children were the youngest one still on her breast would be sent down to storm's end where garen baratheon and young lord borman would see to their upbringing none were ever again to call themselves strong the queen decreed from this day they would bear the bastard names rivers waters and storm for that gift you may think your father the hollow knight the shame that luckmore the lusty visited on the kingsguard and the crown was not the only difficulty jaharis and alisaine faced in 73 ac let us pause now for a moment and consider the vexing question of their seventh and eighth born children prince vegan and princess dialla queen alisain took great pride in arranging marriages and had put together hundreds of fruitful unions for lords and ladies from one end of the realm to another but never had she faced so much difficulty as she did while searching for the mates for her four younger children the struggle would torment her for years bring about no end of conflict between her and the children her daughters in particular drive her and the king apart and in the end bring her so much grief and pain for the time that her grace contemplated renouncing her marriage to spend the rest of her life with the silent sisters the frustration started with vegan and diella only a year apart in age the prince and princess seemed well matched as babes and the king and queen assumed that the two of them would eventually marry their older siblings baylon and alyssa had become inseparable and plans were already being made for them to wed why not vegan and dialla as well be sweet to your little sister king jaharis told the prince when he was five one day she will be your alisain as the children grew however it became apparent that the two of them were not ideally suited there was no warmth between them as the queen saw plainly vagon tolerated his sister's presence but never sought it out daela seemed frightened of her sour bookish brother who would sooner read than play the prince thought the princess stupid she thought him mean they are only children jaharis said when alisane brought the problem to his attention they will warm to one another in time they never did if anything their mutual dislike only deepened the matter came to a head in 73 ac prince vegan was 10 years old and princess daela 9 when one of the queen's companions new to the red keep teasingly asked the two of them when they would be married vegan reacted as if he had been slapped i would never marry her the boy said in front of the half of the court she can barely read she should find some lord in need of stupid children for that's the only sort he will ever have of her princess dialla as might be expected burst into tears and fled the hall with her mother the queen rushing after her it fell to her sister alyssa at 13 3 years wagon's elder to pour a flagon of wine over his head even that did not make the prince repent you're wasting arbor gold was all he said before stalking from the hall to change his clothing plainly the king and queen concluded afterward some other bride must needs be found for vagon briefly they consider their younger daughters princess sarah was six years old in 73 ac princess facera only two vagon has never looked twice at either of them alisaine told the king i'm not sure he's aware that they exist perhaps if some maester wrote about them in a book i shall tell grand maester elisar to commence tomorrow the king japed then he said he is only ten he does not see girls no more than they see him but that will change soon he is comely enough and prince of westeros third in line to the iron throne in a few more years maidens will be flooding around him like butterflies and blushing if he danes to look their way the queen was unconvinced calmly was perhaps too generous a word for prince vegan who had the silver gold hair and purple eyes of the targaryens but was long a face and round of shoulder even at 10 with a pinched sour cast to his mouth the maid men suspect he had recently been sucking on a lemon as his mother her grace was mayhaps blind to these flaws but not to his nature i fear for any butterfly there comes fluttering around vagon he is like to squash it flat beneath a book he spends too much time in the library jahara said let me speak to balon we will get him into our yard and put a sword in his hand and a shield in his arm that will set him right grandmaster elsard tells me that his grace did indeed speak to prince balon who dutifully took his brother under his wing marched him out to the yard put a sword in his hand and a shield upon his arm it did not set him right vagon hated it he was a miserable fighter and he had a gift for making everyone around him miserable as well even balon the brave balon persisted for a year at the king's insistence the more he drills the worse he looks the spring prince confessed one day mayhaps in an attempt to spur vagon into making more of an effort he brought his sister alyssa into the yard shining in man's mail the princess had not forgotten the incident of the arbor gold laughing and shouting mockery she danced around her little brother and humiliated him half a hundred times whilst princess diella looked down from a window shamed beyond endurance vagon threw down his sword and ran from the yard never to return we shall return to prince vegan and his sister dayella in due course but let us now turn to a joyful event in 74 ac king jiharis and queen allison were blessed again by the gods when prince aemon's wife the lady jocelyn presented them with their first grandchild princess rhaenys was born on the seventh day of the seventh moon of the year which the septons judged to be highly auspicious large and fierce she had the black hair of her baratheon mother and the pale violet eyes of our targaryen father as the firstborn child of the prince of dragonstone many hailed her as next in line for the iron throne after her father when queen alisain held her in her arms for the first time she was heard to call the little girl our queen to be in breeding as in so much else balon the brave was not far behind his brother ayman in 75 ac the red keep was the site of another splendid wedding as the spring prince took to bride the eldest of his sisters princess alissa the bride was 15 the groom 18. unlike their father and mother balon and alyssa did not wait to consummate their union the betting that followed their wedding feast was the source of much ribald humor in the days that followed for the young bride's sounds of pleasure could be heard all the way to duskendale men said a shire maid might have been abashed by that but alyssa targaryen was his body a winch as any barmaid in king's landing as she herself was fond of boasting i mounted him and took him for a ride she declared the morning after the betting and i mean to do the same tonight i love to ride nor was her brave prince the only mount the princess was to claim that year like her brothers before her alyssa targaryen meant to be a dragon rider and sooner rather than later eamonn had flown at 17 baylon at 16. alissa meant to do it at 15. according to the tales set down by the dragon keepers it was all they could do to persuade her to not claim valerian here's old and slow princess they had to tell her surely you'll want a swift amount in the end they prevailed and princess alyssa ascended into the sky upon melees a splendid scarlet she-dragon never before ridden red maidens the two of us the princess boasted laughing but now we've both been mounted the princess was seldom long away from the dragon pit after that day flying was the second sweetest thing in the world she would off say and the very sweetest thing could not be mentioned in the company of ladies the dragon keepers had not been wrong melees was as swift a dragon as westeros had ever seen easily outpacing caraxies and veigar when she and her brothers flew together meanwhile the problem of their brother vagon persisted to the queen's frustration the king had not been entirely wrong about the butterflies as the years passed and wagon matured young ladies at the court began to pay him some attention age and some uncomfortable discussions with his father and brothers had taught the prince the rudiments of courtesy and he did not squash any of the girls to the queen's relief but he took no special notice in any of them either books remained his only passion history cartography mathematics languages grand maester elsar never a slave to propriety confessed to having given the prince a volume of erotic drawings thinking mayhaps that pictures of naked maidens comporting with men and beasts and one another might kindle vegan's interest in the charms of women the prince kept the book but showed no change in behavior it was on prince vegan's 15th name day in 78 ac a year short of his manhood that jaharis and alisaine broached the obvious solution to the grand maester do you think mayhap's vagon might have the makings of a maester no elisa replied bluntly can you see him instructing some lord's children how to read and write and do simple sums does he keep a raven in his chamber or any sort of bird can you imagine him removing a man's crushed leg or delivering a baby all these are required of a maester the grand maester paused and then said vagon is no maester but he could well have the makings of an archmaester in him the citadel is the greatest repository of knowledge in the known world send him there mayhaps he will find himself in the library that or he'll get so lost amongst the books that you never need to concern yourselves with him again his word struck home three days later king jaharis summoned prince vegan to his solar to tell him that he would be taking a ship for old town in a fortnight the citadel will take charge of you his grace said it is for you to determine what becomes of you the prince responded currently as was his want yes father good afterwards jaehaerys told the queen that he thought vagon had almost smiled prince balon had not ceased smiling since his marriage when not aloft baylon and alyssa spend every hour together most oft in their bedchamber prince balon was a lusty lad for those same shrieks of pleasure that had echoed through the halls of the red keep on the night of their bedding were heard many other nights in the years that followed and soon enough the much hoped-for result appeared and alyssa targaryen grew great with child in 77 ac she gave her brave prince a son they named viserys septon barth described the boy as a plump and pleasant lad who laughed more than any babe i've ever known and nursed so lustily he drank his wet nurse dry against all advice his mother clapped the boy in swaddling clothes strapped him to her chest and took him aloft on melees when he was nine days old afterward she claimed viserys giggled the whole while burying and delivering a child may be a joy for a young woman of 10 and 7 like the princess alyssa but is quite another matter for one of 40 like her mother queen alisene the joy was therefore not entirely unalloyed when her grace was found to be pregnant once again prince valerion was born in 77ac after another troubled labor that saw alisane confined to her bed for half a year like his brother gaiman four years earlier he was a small and sickly babe and never thrived half a dozen wet nurses came and went to no avail in 78 ac valerian died a fortnight short of his first name day the queen took his passing with resignation i am 42 years old she told the king you must be content with the children i have given you i am more suited to be a grandmother than a mother now i fear king jiharis did not share her certainty our mother queen alyssa was 46 when she gave birth to jocelyn he pointed out to grand maester ellisar the gods may not be done with us he was not wrong the very next year the grand maester informed queen alisain that she was once more with child to her surprise and dismay princess gail was born in 80 ac when the queen was 44 called the winter child for the season of her birth and because the queen was in the winter of her childbearing years some said she was small pale and frail but grand maester elsar was determined that she would not suffer the same fate of her brothers gaiman and valerian nor did she assisted by septa lira who watched over the babe night and day alisar nursed the princess through a difficult first year until finally it seemed as if she might survive when she reached her first name day still healthy if not strong queen alisaine thanked the gods she was thankful as well that year to have finally arranged a marriage for her eighth-born child the princess diella with vegon settled daela had been next in line but the tearful princess presented an entirely different sort of problem my little flower was how the queen described her like alisaine herself dayella was small on her toes she stood five feet two inches and there was a childish aspect to her that led everyone who met her to think she was younger than her age unlike alisaine she was delicate as well in ways the queen had never been her mother had been fearless dayala always seemed to be afraid she had a kitten that she loved until he scratched her then she would not go near a cat the dragons terrified her even silver wing the mildless scolding would reduce her to tears once in the halls of the red keep daela had encountered a prince from the summer isles in his feathered cloak and squealed in terror his black skin had made her take him for a demon cruel though her brother vagon's words had been there was some truth to them diallo was not clever even her septa had to admit she learned to read after a fashion but haltingly and without full comprehension she could not seem to commit even the simplest prayers to memory she had a sweet voice but was afraid to sing she always got the words wrong she loved flowers but was frightened of gardens a beehead almost stung her once jiharis even more than alisane despaired for her she will not even speak to a boy how is she to marry we could entrust her to the faith but she does not know her prayers and her septa says that she cries when asked to read aloud from the seven-pointed star the queen always rose to her defense daela is a sweet and kind and gentle she has such a tender heart give me time and i will find a lord to cherish her not every targaryen needs to wield a sword and ride a dragon in the years that followed her first flowering diallo targaryen drew the eye of many a young lordling as expected she was a king's daughter and maidenhood had only made her prettier her mother was at work as well arranging matters in every way she could to place suitable marriage prospects before the princess at 13 dayella was sent to driftmark to meet cordless valerion the grandson of the lord of the tides ten years her elder the future sea snake was already a celebrated mariner and captain of ships daela became seasick crossing blackwater bay however and on her return complained that he likes his boats better than he likes me she was not wrong in that at 14 she kept company with dennis swann simon staunton gerald templeton and ellard crane all promising squires out of her own age but staunton tried to make her drink wine and crane kissed her on the lips without her leave reducing her to tears by year's end daela had decided she hated all of them at 15 her mother took her across the riverlands to raventree in a wheelhouse as daela was afraid of horses where lord blackwood entertained queen allison lavishly whilst his son paid court to the princess tall graceful courtly and well-spoken royce blackwood was a gifted bowman a fine swordsman and a singer who melted daela's heart with ballads of his own composition for a short while it seemed as if betrothal might be in the offing and queen alsane and lord blackwood even began to discuss wedding plans it all fell to pieces when daela learned that the blackwoods kept the old gods and she would be expected to say her vows before a weirwood they don't believe in the gods she told her mother horrified i'd go to hell her 16th name day was fast approaching and with it her womanhood queen allison was at her wit's end and the king had lost patience on the first day of the 80th year since aegon's conquest he told the queen he wanted dialla wed before the year's end if she wants i can find a hundred men and line them up before her naked and she can pick the one she likes he said i would sooner she wet a lord but if she prefers a hedge knight or a merchant or paint the pig boy i am past the point of caring so long as she picks someone a hundred naked men would frighten her alisene said unamused a hundred naked ducks would frighten her the king replied and if she will not wed the queen asked magel says the faith will not want a girl who cannot read her prayers there are still silent sisters said jaharis must it come to that find her someone someone gentle as she is a kind man who will never raise his voice or his hand to her who will speak to her sweetly and tell her she is precious and protect her against dragons and horses and bees and kittens and boys with boils and whatever else she fears i shall do my best your grace queen alisaine promised in the end it did not require a hundred men naked or clothed the queen explained the king's command to daela gently but firmly and offered her a choice of three suitors each of whom was eager for her hand paint the pig boy was not amongst them it should be said the three men that alisane had selected were great lords or the sons of great lords whichever man she married daela would have wealth and position foreman baratheon was the most imposing of the candidates at 8 and 20 the lord of storm's end was the image of his father brawny and powerful with a booming laugh a great black beard and a mane of thick black hair as the son of lord rogar by queen elissa he stood half-brother to alisain and jiharis and daela knew and loved his sister jocelyn from her years at court which was thought to be much in his favor sir tyman lannister was the wealthiest contender heir to casually rock and all its gold at 20 he was nearer to daela's own age and thought to be one of the handsomest men in the realm lithe and slender with long golden mustachioes and hair of the same hue always clad in silk and satin the princess would well be protected in casually rock there was no castle more impregnable in all of westeros wade against lannister gold and lannister beauty however was sir tymon's own reputation he was overly fond of women it was said and even more fond of wine last of the three and least in many eyes was roderick aaron lord of the eerie and protector of the veil he had been a lord since the age of 10 a point in his favor for the past 20 years he had served on the small council as lord justice r and master of laws during which time he had become a familiar figure about the court and a legal friend to both king and queen in the veil he had been an able lord strong but just affable open-handed loved by the small folk and his lord's bannermen alike in addition he had acquitted himself well in king's landing sensible knowledgeable good humored and he was regarded as a great asset to the council lord aaron was the oldest of the three contenders however at 6 and 30 he was 20 years older than the princess and a father besides with four children left him by his late first wife short and balding with a kettle belly aaron was not the man most maidens dream of queen alsain admitted but he is the sort you asked for a kind and gentle man and he says that he has loved our little girl for years i know he will protect her to the astonishment of every woman at the court save mayhaps the queen princess daela chose lord rodrick to be her husband he seems good and wise like father she told queen alisene and he has four children i'm to be their new mother what her grace thought of that outburst is not recorded grand maester elsar's account of the day says only gods be good theirs would not be a long betrayal as the king had wished princess daela and lord rodrick were wed before the year's end it was a small ceremony in the septet dragonstone attended only by close friends and kin larger crowds made the princess desperately uncomfortable nor was there a bedding oh i could not bear that i should die of shame the princess had told her husband to be and lord rodrick had a seated to her wishes afterward lord aaron took his princess back to the eerie my children need to meet the new mother and i want to show the veil to dayella life is slower there and quieter she will like that i swear to you your grace she will be safe and happy and so she was for a time the eldest of lord rodrick's four children from his first wife was a daughter ellis three years older than her new stepmother the two of them clashed from the first dayella doted on the three younger children however and they seemed to adore her in turn lord rodrick true to his word was a kind and caring husband who never failed to pamper and protect the bride he called my precious princess such letters as daelis said her mother letters largely written for her by lord roderick's younger daughter amanda spoke glowingly of how happy she was how beautiful the veil how much she loved her lord's sweet sons how everyone in the eerie was so kind to her prince eamon reached his 26th name day in 81 ac and had proved himself more than able in both war and peace as the heir apparent to the iron throne it was felt desirable that he take a greater role in the governance of the realm as a member of the king's council accordingly king jaharis named the prince his justice r and master of laws in place of roderick aaron i will leave the making of the law to you brother prince baylon declared while shrinking to prince aemon's appointment i would sooner make sons and that was just what he did for later that same year princess elissa bore her spring prince a second son who was given the name damon his mother irrepressible as ever took the babe into the sky on melees within a fortnight of his birth just as she had done with his brother viserys in the veil however her sister dayella was not doing near as well after a year and a half of marriage a different sort of message arrived at the red keep by raven it was very short and written in diella's own uncertain hand i am with child it said mother please come i'm frightened queen alsain was frightened too once she read those words she mounted silver wing within days and flew swiftly to the veil a lighting first in goldtown before proceeding on to the gates of the moon and then skyward to the eerie it was 82 ac and her grace arrived three moons before diallo was due to give birth though the princess professed delight that her mother had come and apologized for sending her such a silly letter her fear was palpable she burst into tears for the slightest reason and sometimes for no reason at all lord roderick said his daughter ellis was dismissive telling her grace you would think she's the first woman ever to have a baby but alisaine was concerned daela was so delicate and she was carrying very heavy she is such a small girl for such a big belly she wrote the king i would be frightened too if i were her queen alisane stayed beside the princess for the rest of her confinement sitting by her bedside reading her to sleep at night and comforting her fears it will be fine she told her daughter half a hundred times she will be a girl wait and see a daughter i know it everything will be fine she was half right emma aaron the daughter of lord rodrick and princess diella came into the world a fortnight early after a long and troubled labor it hurts the princess screamed through half the night it hurts so much but it is said she smiled when her daughter was laid against her breast everything was far from fine however childbed fever set in soon after birth though princess daela desperately wished to nurse her child she had no milk and a wet nurse was sent for as her fever rose the maester decreed that she might not even hold her babe which set the princess so weeping she wept until she fell asleep but in her sleep she kicked wildly and tossed and turned her fever rising even higher by morning she was gone she was 18 years of age lord rodrick wept as well and begged the queen's permission to bury his precious princess in the veil but alsane refused she was the blood of the dragon she will be burned and her ashes and turned on dragonstone beside her sister daenerys daela's death tore the heart out of the queen but as we look back it is plain to see that it was also the first hint of the rift that would open between her and the king the gods hold us all in their hands and life and death are theirs to give and take away but men in their pride look for others to blame alisaine targaryen in her grief blamed herself and lord aaron and the eeries maester for their parts in her daughter's demise but most of all she blamed jiharis if he had not insisted that daela wed that she picked someone before year's end what harm would it have done for her to stay a little girl for another year or two or even 10. she was not old enough or strong enough to bear a child she told his grace back at king's landing we ought never have pushed her into marriage it is not recorded how the king replied the 83rd year after aegon's conquest is remembered as the year of the fourth dornish war better known amongst the small folk as prince maurian's madness or the war of the hundred candles the old prince of dorne had died and his son maurian martell had succeeded him in sunspear a rash and foolish young man prince maurian had long bristled at his father's cowardice during lord rogar's war when knights of the seven kingdoms had marched into the red mountains unmolested whilst the dornish army stayed at home and left the vulture king to his fate determined to avenge this stain on dornish honor the prince planned his own invasion of the seven kingdoms though he knew dorne could not hope to prevail against the might that the iron throne could muster against him prince moryan thought that he might take king jiharis unawares and conquer the stormlands as far as storm's end or at the very least cape wrath rather than attack by the way of the prince's past he planned to come by sea he would assemble his hosts at ghost hill and the tour load them on ships and sail them across the sea of dorne to take the stormlanders by surprise if he was defeated or driven back so be it but before he went he swore to burn a hundred towns and raise a hundred castles so the stormlanders might know that they could never again march into the red mountains with impunity the madness of this plan can be seen in the fact that there are neither 100 towns nor 100 castles on cape wrath nor even a third of that number doran had not boasted any strength at sea since nymeria burned her 10 000 ships but prince morion did have gold and he found willing allies in the pirates of the stepstones the cell sales of mir and the corsairs of the pepper coast though it took him the best part of a year eventually the ships came straggling in and the prince and his spearmen were loaded aboard mauryan had been weaned on the tails of past dornish glory and like many young dornish lords he had seen the sun-mottled bones of the dragon miraxis at the hellholt every ship in his fleet was therefore manned with crossbowmen and equipped with massive scorpions of the sort that had felled miraxis if the targaryens dared to send dragons against him he would fill the air with bolts and kill them all the folly of prince maurian's plans cannot be overstated his hopes of taking the iron throne unawares were laughable for a start not only did jiharis have spies in morien's own court and friends amongst the shrewder dornish lords but the pirates of the stepstones the self-sails of mir and the corsairs of the pepper coast are none of them famed for their discretion a few coins changing hands was all it took by the time morion set sail the king had known of his attack for half a year borman baratheon lord of storm's end had been made aware as well and was waiting on cape wrath to give the dornishmen a red welcome when they came ashore he would never have the chance jaehaerus targaryen and his sons eamonn and baylon had been waiting as well and as morgan's fleet beat its way across the sea of dorne the dragon's vermathor caraxis and vegar fell on them out of the clouds shouts rang out and the dornish filled the air with scorpion bolts but firing at a dragon is one thing and killing it is quite another a few bolts glanced off the scales of the dragons and one punched through veigar's wing but none of them found any vulnerable spots as the dragons swooped and banked and loose great blasts of fire one by one ships went up in gouts of flame they were still burning when the sun went down like a hundred candles floating on the sea burned bodies would wash up on the shores of cape wrath for half a year but not a single living dornish men set foot upon the stormlands the fourth dornish war was fought and won in a single day the pirates of the stepstones the cell sails of mir and the corsairs of the pepper coast became less troublesome for a time and mara martel became the princess of dorne back in king's landing king jaharis and his sons received a riotous welcome even aegon the conqueror had never won a war without losing a man prince balon had another cause for celebration as well his wife alyssa was again with child this time he told his brother eamonn he was praying for a girl princess alissa was brought to bed again in 84 ac after a long and difficult labor she gave prince balon a third son a boy they named aegon after the conqueror they call me bailon the brave the prince told his wife at her bedside but you are far braver than me i would soon fight a dozen battles then do what you've just done alyssa laughed at him you were made for battles and i was made for this viserys and damon and again that's three as soon as i am a well that makes another i want to give you 20 sons an army of your own it was not to be alyssa targaryen had a warrior's heart in a woman's body and her strength failed her she never fully recovered from aegon's birth and died within a year at only four and twenty nor did prince aegon long survive her he perished half a year later still shy of his first name day though shattered by his loss balon took solace than the two strong sons that she had left him viserys and damon and never ceased to honor the memory of his sweet lady with a broken nose and mismatched eyes and now i fear we must turn our attention to one of the most troubling and distasteful chapters in the long reign of king jiharis and queen alisene the matter of their ninth-born child princess sarah born in 67 ac three years after daela sarah had all the courage that her sister lacked along with the voracious hunger for milk for food for affection for praise as a babe she did not do so much cry as scream and her ear piercing whales became the terror of every maid in the red key she wants what she wants and she wants it now grand maester lsr wrote of the princess in ac when she was only two seven save us went all when she is older the dragon keepers had best lock up the dragons he had no notion of how prophetic those words would be septum barth was more reflective as he observed the princess at the age of 12 in 79 ac she is the king's daughter and well aware of it servants see to her every need though not always as quickly as she might like great lords and handsome knights show her every courtesy the ladies of the court defer to her girls of her own age vie with one another to be her friends all of this sarah takes as her due if she were the king's firstborn or better still his only child she would be well content instead she finds herself the ninth born with six living siblings who are older than her and even more adored amen is to be king balon most likely would be hand and alyssa may be all her mother is and more vegan is more learned than she is maegel is holier and daela when does the day go by when daela is not in need of comfort and while she is being soothed sarah is being ignored such a fierce little thing she is they say she has no need of comfort they are wrong in that i fear all men need comfort area targaryen had once been thought to be wild and willful given to acts of disobedience but princess sarah's girlhood made arya seem a model of decorum by comparison the border between innocent pranks wanton mischief and acts of malice is not always discerned by one so young but there can be no doubt that the princess crossed it freely she was forever sneaking cats into her sister daela's bedchamber knowing that she was frightened of them once she filled daela's chamber pot with bees she slipped into white sword tower when she was ten stole all the white cloaks that she could find and dyed them pink at seven she learned when and how to steal into the kitchens to make off with cakes and pies and other treats before she was 11 she was stealing wine and ale instead by 12 she was like as not to arrive drunk when summoned to the sept for prayer the king's half-witted fool tom turnip was the victim of many of her japes and her unwitting catspaw for others once before a great feast where many lords and ladies were to be in attendance she persuaded tom that it would be much funnier if he performed dankit it was not well received later far more cruelly she told him that if he climbed the iron throne he could be king but the fool was clumsy at best of times and prone to tremors and the throne sliced his arms and legs to pieces she's an evil child her septa said of her afterward princess sarah had half a dozen septas and his many bed maids before she turned 13. this is not to say that the princess was without her virtues her maesters affirmed that she was very clever as bright as her brother vegan in her own way she was certainly pretty taller than her sister diella and not half so delicate and is strong and quick spirited as her sister alyssa when she wanted to be charming it was hard to resist her her big brothers eamonn and balon never failed to be amused by her mischief though they never knew the worst of it and long before she was half-grown sarah had learned the art of getting anything she wanted from her father a kitten a hound a pony a hawk a horse jaehaerys did draw a firm line at an elephant queen allison was far less gullible however and septon barth tells us that sarah's sisters all misliked her to various degrees maidenhood became her and sarah truly came into her own after her first flowering after all they had endured with daela the king and queen must have been relieved to see how eagerly sarah took to the young men of the court and they to her at 14 she told the king she meant to marry the prince of dorne or perhaps the king be on the wall so she could be a queen like mother that year a traitor from the summer isles came to court far from shrieking at the sight of him as daela had sarah said she might like to marry him too by 15 she had put such idol fantasies aside why dream of distant monarchs when she could have as many squires knights and likely lords as she desired dozens danced attendance on her but three soon emerged as favorites jonah mutin was the heir to the maiden pool red roy connington was the 15 year old lord of griffin's roost and braxton beesberry called stinger was a 19 year old knight the finest lance in the reach and the heir to honey hole the princess had female favorites as well perrian moore and alice turnberry the two maids of her own age became her dearest friends sarah called them pretty perry and sweet berry for more than a year the three maids and the three young lords were inseparable at every feast and ball they hunted and hawked together too and one sailed across blackwater bay to dragonstone when the three lords rode at rings or crossed swords in the yards the three maids were there to cheer them on king jiharis who was forever entertaining visiting lords or envoys from across the narrow sea sitting at council or planning further roads was well pleased they would not need to scour the realm to find a match for sarah when three such promising young men were at hand queen allison was less convinced sarah is clever but not wise she told the king lady perrian and lady alice were pretty vapid empty-headed little fools from what she had seen of them whilst connington and mutin were callow boys and i do not like the stinger i've heard he sired a bastard in the reach and another here in king's landing jaharis remained unconcerned it is not as if sarah were ever alone with any of them there are always people about serving men and maids grooms and men at arms what mischief can they get up to with so many eyes around them he did not like the answer when it came one of sarah's japes was their undoing on a warm spring night in 84 ac shouts and screams from a brothel called the blue pearl drew the notice of two men of the city watch the screams were coming from tom turnip who was lurching helplessly in circles trying to escape from half a dozen naked [ __ ] whilst the patrons of the house laughed uproariously and shouted on the harlots jonah mooton red roy connington and stinger beesberry were amongst those patrons each one drunker than the last they thought it would be funny to see old turnip do the deed redroy admitted then jonah mooton laughed and said that jape had all been sarah's notion and what a funny girl she was the watchman rescued the hapless fool and escorted him back to the red keep the three lords they brought before sir robert redwine their commander sir robert delivered them to the king ignoring stinger's threats and connington's clumsy attempt to bribe him it is never pleasant to lance a boyle grand maester elisara wrote of the affair you never know how much pus will come out or how badly it will smell the pus that burst forth from the blue pearl would smell very badly indeed the three drunken lords had sobered somewhat by the time the king confronted them from atop the iron throne and put up a bold front they confessed to making off with tom turnip and bringing him to the blue pearl none of them said a word concerning princess sarah when his grace ordered mooton to repeat what he had said about the princess he blushed and stammered and claimed the watchmen had misheard jiharis finally ordered the three lordlings taken to the dungeons let them sleep in the black cell tonight mayhaps they will tell the different tale come morning it was queen alisain knowing how close lady perrian and lady alice had been to the three lords who suggested that they be questioned as well let me speak with them your grace if they see you up on the throne glaring down at them they will be so frightened they will never say a word the hour was late and her guardsmen found both girls asleep sharing a bed in lady perrian's chambers the queen had them brought before her and her sawler their three young lords were in the dungeon she told the girls if they did not wish to join them they would tell the truth it was all she needed to say sweet barry and pretty perry stumbled over one another in their eagerness to confess before long both of them were weeping and pleading for forgiveness queen alsain let them plead never saying a word she listened as she had done before at 100 women's courts her grace knew how to listen it was just a game at the start pretty perry said sarah was teaching alice how to kiss so i asked if she would teach me too the the the boys trained at fighting every morning why shouldn't we train it kissing that's what girls are meant to do isn't it al's turnberry agreed kissing was sweet she said and one night we started kissing with our clothes off and that was scary but exciting we took turns pretending we were boys we never meant to be wicked we were only playing then sarah dared me to kiss a real boy and i dared perry to do the same and both of us dared sarah but she said she would do us one better she would kiss a grown man a knight that's how it began with roy and jonah and stinger lady perrian jumped back in then to say afterward it was stinger who did the training for all of them he has two bastards she whispered one in the reach and one right here on the street of silk her mother is a [ __ ] at the blue pearl that was the only mention of the blue pearl neither of the trolls knew the slightest thing concerning poor tom turnip as irony would have it grand maester lsr would write afterward but they knew a great deal about certain other things none of them which had been their fault where were your scepters doing all of this the queen demanded when she had heard them out where were your maids and the lords they would have been attended where were the grooms the men at arms their squires and serving men lady perrian was confused by the question we we told them to wait without she said in the tone of one explaining that the sun rises in the east they're servants they do what you tell them the ones who knew they knew to keep quiet stinger said he'd have their tongues out if they talked and sarah is smarter than the septus that was where sweetberry broke down and began to sob and tear at her own dressing gown she was so sorry she told the queen she had never wanted to be bad stinger made her and sarah said she was a craven so she showed them but now she was with child and she did not know who the father was and what was she to do all you can do tonight is go to bed queen allisane told her on the morrow we shall send a scepter to you and you can make confession of your sins the mother will forgive you my mother won't said alice turnberry but she went as she was told lady perrian helped her sobbing friend back to her room when the queen told him what she had learned king jiharis could scarce credit a word of it guards were sent forth and a succession of squires grooms and maids were dragged before the iron throne for questioning many of them wound up in the dungeons with their masters once their answers had been heard dawn had come by the time the last of them had been led away only then did the king and queen send for princess sarah the princess surely knew that something was amiss when the lord commander of the kingsguard and the commander of the city watch appeared together to escort her to the iron throne it was never good when the king received you while seated on the iron throne the great hall was almost empty when she was brought in only grand maester elisar and septon barth had been summoned to bear witness they spoke for the citadel and the starry sept and the king felt a need for their guidance but there were things like to be said that day that his other lords need never know it is oft said that the red keep has no secrets that there are rats in the walls who hear everything and whisper in the ears above sleepers by night mayhap so for when princess sarah came before her father she appeared to know all that had happened at the blue pearl and be not the least abashed i told them to do it but i never thought they would she said lightly that must have been so funny turn up dancing with a horse not for tom said king jaharis from the iron throne he is a fool princess sarah answered with a shrug fools are meant to be laughed at where is the harm in that turnip loves it when you laugh at him he was a cruel shape said queen alisene but now there are other matters that concern me more i've been speaking with your ladies are you aware that alice turnberry is with child it was only then that the princess came to realize that she was not there to answer for tom turnip but more for shameful sins for a moment sarah was at a loss for words but only for a moment then she gasped and said my sweet berry truly she oh what has she done oh my sweet little fool if septon barth's testimony is to be believed a tear rolled down her cheek her mother was not moved you know perfectly well what she has done what all of you have done we will have the truth from you now child and when the princess looked to her father she found no comfort there lie to us again and it will go very much the worse for you king jeharas told his daughter your three lords are in the dungeons you all know and what you say next may determine where you sleep tonight sarah crumbled then and the words came tumbling out one after another in a rush a flood that left the princess almost breathless she went from denial to dismissal to quibbling to contrition to accusation to justification to defiance in the space of an hour with stops at giggling and weeping along the way septon barthward right she never did it they were lying it never happened how could they believe that it was just a game it was just a jape who said that that was not how it happened everyone likes kissing she was sorry perry started it it was such fun no one was hurt no one ever told her kissing was bad sweet barry had dared her she was so ashamed balon used to kiss elissa all the time once she started she did not know how to stop she was afraid of stinger the mother above had forgiven her all the girls were doing it the first time she was drunk she had never wanted to it was what men wanted magel said the gods forgave all sins jonah said he loved her the gods had made her pretty it was not her fault she would be good from now on it will be as if it never happened she would marry red roy connington they had to forgive her she would never kiss a man again or do any of those other things it wasn't her who was with child she was their daughter she was their little girl she was a princess if she were queen she would do what she liked why wouldn't they believe her they never loved her she hated them they could whip her if they wanted but she would never be their slave she took my breath away this girl there was never a mummer in our land who gave such a performance but by end she was exhausted and afraid and her mass slipped what have you done the king said when at last the princess ran out of words seven save us what have you done have you given one of these boys your maidenhead tell me true true said sarah it was in that moment with that word that contempt came out no i gave it to all three they all think they were the first boys are such silly fools jaehaerys was so horrified he could not speak but the queen kept her composure you're very proud of yourself i see a woman grown and nearly seven in ten and i'm sure you think you have been very clever but it is one thing to be clever and another to be wise what do you imagine will happen now sarah i will be married the princess said why shouldn't i be you were married at my age i shall be wedded and bedded but to whom jonah and roy both love me i could take one of them but they are both such boys stinger does not love me but he makes me laugh and sometimes makes me scream i could marry all three of them why not why should i have just one husband the conqueror had two wives and maegor had six or eight she had gone too far jaeharys rose to his feet and descended from the iron throne his face a mask of rage you would compare yourself to maegor is that who you aspire to be his grace had heard enough take her back to her bedchamber he told his guards and keep her there until i send for her again when the princess heard his words she rushed toward him crying father father but jeharis turned his back on her and sir giles morgan caught her by the arm and wrenched her away she would not go over her own accord so the guards were forced to drag her from the hall wailing and sobbing and calling for her father even then septembarth tells us princess sarah might have been forgiven and restored to favor if she had done as she was told if she had remained meekly in her chambers reflecting on her sins and praying for forgiveness jaharis and alisain met all the next day with barth and greymaster elsar discussing what was to be done with the six sinners particularly the princess the king was angry and unyielding for his shame was deeply felt and he could not forgive sarah's taunting words about his uncle's wives she's no longer my daughter he said more than once queen allison could not find it in her heart to be so harsh however she is our daughter she told the king she must be punished yes but she's still a child and where there is sin there can be redemption my lord my love you reconciled with the lords who fought for your uncle you forgave the men who rode with septon moon you reconciled with the faith and with lord rogar when he tried to tear us apart and put arya on your throne surely you can find some way to reconcile with your own daughter her grace's words were soft and gentle and jaharis was moved by them september tells us alcene was stubborn and persistent and she had a way of bringing the king around to her own point of view no matter how far apart they had been at the start given time she might have softened his stance on sarah as well she would not have that time that very night princess sarah sealed her fate instead of remaining in her room as she had been instructed she slipped away whilst visiting the privy donned a washerwoman's robes and stole horse from the stables and escaped from the castle she got halfway across the city to the hill of rhaenys but as she tried to enter the dragon pit she was found and taken by the dragon keepers and returned to the red key alisane wept when she heard for she knew her cause was hopeless jiharis was as hard as stone sarah with a dragon was all he had to say would she have taken valerian as well i wonder this time the princess was not allowed to return to her own chambers she was confined to a tower cell instead with john keel dark guarding her day and night even in the privy hasty marriages were arranged for her sisters in sin perianne moore who was not pregnant was wed to jonah mooton you played a partner ruin you can be a part of her redemption the king told the young lordling the marriage proved to be a success and in time the two became the lord and lady of maidenpool alice turnberry who was pregnant presented a harder case as red roy connington refused to marry her i will not pretend sting is bastard as my son nor make him the heir to griffin's roost he told the king defiant instead sweetberry was sent to the vale to give birth a girl with bright red hair at a mother house on an island in goldtown harbor where many lords sent their natural daughters to be raised afterward she was married to dunstan pryor the lord of pebble an island off of the fingers connington was given a choice between a lifetime in the night's watch or 10 years of exile unsurprisingly he chose exile and made his way across the narrow seat of pentos and thence to mir where he fell in with sellswords and the other low company only half a year before he might have returned to westeros he was stabbed to death by a [ __ ] in a mirish gambling den the harshest punishment was reserved for braxton beesberry the proud young knight called stinger i could geld you and send you to the wall jiharis told him that was how i served sir luckamore but he was a better man than you i could take her father's lands in castle but there would be no justice in that he had no part in what you did no more than your brothers did we cannot have you spreading tales about my daughter though so we mean to take your tongue and your nose as well i think so you may not find the maids quite so easy to beguile you are far too proud of your skill with sword and lance so we will take that away from you as well we shall break your arms and legs and my masters will be certain that they heal crookedly you will live the rest of your sorry life a [ __ ] unless unless beesberry was as white as chalk is there a choice any knight accused of wrongdoing has a choice the king reminded him you can prove your innocence add hazard of your body then i choose trial by combat stinger said he was by all accounts an arrogant young man and sure of his skill at arms he looked about at the seven kingsguards standing beneath the iron throne in their long white cloaks and shining scale and said which of these old men do you mean for me to fight this old man announced jaehaerys targaryen the one whose daughter you seduced and despoiled they met the next morning at dawn the heir to honeyholt was 19 years of age the king 49 but still far from an old man beesberry armed himself with a morning star thinking mayhaps that jaharis would be less accustomed to defending himself against that weapon the king bore blackfyre both men were well armored and carried shields when the combat began stinger rushed hard at his grace seeking to overwhelm him with the speed and strength of youth making the spiked ball whirl and dance and sing jiharis took every blow on his shield however contenting himself with defense whilst the younger man wore himself out soon enough the time arrived when braxton beesberry could scarce lift his arm and then the king moved to attack even the best of male is hard-pressed to turn valyrian steel and jaharis knew where every weak point could be found stinger was bleeding from half a dozen wounds when he finally fell jiharis kicked his shattered shield away opened the visor of his helm laid blackfyre's point against his eye and drove it deep queen allison did not attend the duel she told the king that she could not bear the thought that he might die princess sarah watched from the window of her cell john kill dark her galore made certain that she did not turn away a fortnight later jaehaerus and alisaine gave another of their daughters over to the faith princess sarah who is not quite 17 departed king's landing for old town where her sister septa maegel was to take charge of her instruction she would be a novice it was announced with the silent sisters septon barth who knew the king's mind better than most would later maintain the sentence was meant to be a lesson no one could mistake sarah for her sister magel least of all her father she would never be a septa much less a silent sister but she required punishment and it was thought that a few years of silent prayer harsh discipline and contemplation would be good for her that it would set her on the path of redemption that was not the path that sarah targaryen cared to walk however the princess endured the silence the cold baths the scratchy rough spun robes the meatless meals she submitted to having her head shaved and being scrubbed with horse hair brushes and when she was disobedient she submitted to the cane as well all this she suffered for a year and a half but when her chance came in 85 ac she seized it fleeing from the mother house in the dead of night and making her way down to the docks when an older sister came upon her during her escape she knocked the woman down a flight of steps and leapt over her to the door when word of her flight reached king's landing it was assumed that sarah would be hiding somewhere in old town but lord hightower's men combed the city door to door and no trace was found of her it was then thought mayhaps that she would make her way back to the red keep to beg pardon from her father when she did not appear there either the king wondered if she might not flee to her former friends so jonah moon and his wife perrian were told to keep watch for her at maidenpool the truth did not come out until a year later when the former princess was seen in a lysene pleasure garden still clad as a novice queen elsain wept to hear it they've made our daughter into a [ __ ] she said she always was the king replied jaehaerys targaryen celebrated his 50th name day in 84 ac the years had taken their toll on him and those who knew him well said that he was never the same after his daughter sarah had disgraced and then abandoned him he had grown thinner almost gaunt and there was more gray than gold in his beard now and in his hair for the first time men were calling him the old king rather than the conciliator alisaine shaken by all the losses they had suffered withdrew more and more from the governance of the realm and seldom came to council meetings any longer but jaharis still had his faithful sept in barth and his sons if there is another war he told the two of them it will be for you to fight it i have my roads to finish it was better with rhodes than with daughters grand maester elsar would write later in his customary waspish style in 86 ac queen allison announced the betrothal of her daughter viscera 15 years of age to theomore manderly the fierce old lord of white harbor the marriage would do much and more to tie the realm together by uniting one of the great houses of the north to the iron throne the king declared lord theomor had won great renown as a warrior in his youth and had proved himself a kenny lord under whose rule white harbor had prospered greatly queen elsie was very fond of him as well remembering the warm welcome he had given her during her first visit to the north his lordship had outlived four wives however and while still a dowdy fighter he had grown very stout which did little to recommend him to princess visera she had a different man in mind even as a little girl viscera had been the most beautiful of the queen's daughters great lords famous knights and callow boys had danced attendance on her all her life feeding her vanity until it became a raging fire her great delight in life was playing one boy off against another goading them into foolish quests and contests to win her favor for a joust she made admiring squires swim the blackwater rush climb the tower of the hand or set free all the ravens in the rookery once she took six boys to the dragonpit and told them she would give her maidenhead to whoever put his head in a dragon's mouth but the gods were good that day and the dragon keepers put an end to that no squire was ever going to win visera queen elsa knew not her heart and certainly not her maidenhead she was far too sly a child to go down the same path as her sister sarah she has no interest in kissing games nor boys the queen told you harris she plays with them as she used to play with her puppies but she would no more lie with one than with a dog she aims much higher avra sarah i've seen the way she preens and prances around balon that is the husband she desires and not for love of him she wants to be the queen prince balon was 14 years older than visera 29 to her 15 but the older lords had married younger maids as she knew well it had been two years since princess alissa had died yet balon had shown no interest in any other woman he married one sister why not another visera told her closest friend the empty-headed beatrice butterwell i am much prettier than alyssa ever was you saw her she had a broken nose if the princess was intent on marrying her brother the queen was equally determined to prevent it her answer was lord manderly and white harbor theomore's a good man alisaine told her daughter a wise man with a kind heart and a good head on his shoulders his people love him the princess was not persuaded if you like him so much mother you should marry him she said before running to her father to complain jiharis offered her no solace it is a good match he told her before explaining the importance of drawing the north closer to the iron throne marriages were the queen's domain in any case he said he never interfered with such matters frustrated viscera next turned to her brother baylon in hopes of rescue if court gossip can be believed slipping past the guards into his bed chamber one night she disrobed and waited for him making free with the prince's wine while she lingered when prince baylon finally appeared he found her drunk and naked in his bed and sent her on her way the princess was so unsteady that she required the help of two maids and a knight of the kingsguard to get her safely back to her own apartment how the battle of wills between queen alisain and her headstrong 15 year old daughter might have finally resolved will never be known not long after the incident in balon's bed chamber as the queen was making arrangements for vasara's departure from king's landing the princess traded clothes with one of her maids to escape the guards who had been assigned to keep her out of mischief and slipped from the red keep for what she termed one last night of laughter before i go and freeze her companions were all men two minor lordlings and four young knights all green as spring grass and eager for vasara's favor one of them had offered to show the princess parts of the city that she had never seen the pot shops and rat pits of flea bottom the inns along eel alley and river row where the serving winches danced on tables the brothels of the street of silk ale mead and wine all featured in the evenings frolicks and viscera partook eagerly at some point near to midnight the princess and her remaining companions several of the knights having become insensible from drink decided to race back to the castle a wild ride through the streets of the city ensued with king's landers scrambling out of the way to avoid being run down and trampled laughter rang throughout the night and spirits were high until the racers reached the foot of aegon's high hill where viserys palfrey collided with one of her companions the night's marrow lost her footing and fell breaking his leg beneath her the princess was thrown from the saddle head first into a wall her neck was broken it was the hour of the wolf the darkest time of night when it fell to sir ryan redwine of the kingsguard to rouse the king and queen from their sleep to tell them that their daughter had been found dead in an alley at the foot of aegon's high hill despite their differences the loss of princess visera was devastating to the queen in the space of five years the gods had taken three of her daughters daela in 82 ac alyssa in 84 ac viscera in 87 ac prince balon was greatly distraught as well wondering if he should have spoken to his sister less brustly the night he found her naked in his bed though he and eamonn were a comfort to the king and queen in their time of grief along with eamonn's wife the lady jocelyn and their daughter rhaenys it was to her own remaining daughters that alsane turned for solace maegel 25 years of age in a septa took leave from her sept to stay with her mother for the rest of that year and princess gail a sweet shy child of seven became the queen's constant shadow and support even sharing her bed at night the queen took strength from their presence but even so more and more she found her thoughts turning to the daughter who was not with her though jaharis had forbidden it alsane defied his edict and secretly engaged agents to keep watch over her wayward child across the narrow sea sarah was still in lease she knew from their reports still at the pleasure garden now 20 years of age she often entertained her admirers still garbed as the novice of the faith there were evidently a good many lyceni who took pleasure in ravishing innocent young women who had taken vows of chastity even when the innocence was feigned it was her grief over the loss of princess facera that finally drove the queen to approach jiharis about sarah once again she brought septon barth along with her to speak on the virtues of forgiveness and the healing properties of time only when barth had finished did her grace mention sarah's name please she begged the king it is time to bring her home she has been punished long enough surely she is our daughter jiharis would not be moved she is a lyceni [ __ ] his grace replied she opened her legs for half my court threw an old woman down the steps and tried to steal a dragon what more do you require have you given any thought as to how she got to lis she had no coin how do you think she paid for her passage the queen cringed at the harshness of his words but still she would not yield if you will not bring sarah home for love of her bring her home for love of me i need her you need her as a dornishman needs a pit viper jahara said i am sorry king's landing has sufficient [ __ ] i do not wish to hear her name again with those words he rose to leave but at the door he halted and turned back we have been together since we were children i know you as well as you know me right now you are thinking that you do not need my leave to bring her home that you can take silverwing and fly to lease yourself what would you do then visit her in pleasure garden do you imagine she will fly into your arms and beg forgiveness she is more like to slap you in the face and what will the lyceni do if you try and make off with one of their [ __ ] she has value to them how much do you think it costs to lay with a targaryen princess at best they will demand a ransom for her at worst they may decide to keep you too what will you do then shout for silly wing to burn the city down would you have me send to aemon and balon with an army to see if they can prize her free you want her yes i hear you you need her but she does not need you or me or westeros she is dead bury her queen alisane did not fly to lis but neither did she ever quite forgive the king for the words he spoke that day plans had been underway for some time for the two of them to make another progress for the following year returning to the westerlands for the first time in 20 years shortly after they're falling out the queen informed jiharis that he should go alone she was going back to dragonstone alone to grieve for their dead daughters and so it was that jaharis targaryen flew to casterly rock and the other great seats of the west alone in 88 ac this time he even called on fair isle for the despised lord franklin was safely in his grave the king was gone far longer than it had been originally intended he had roadworks to inspect and he found himself making unplanned stops at smaller towns and castles delighting many a petty lord and landed night prince eamon joined him at certain castles prince balon and others but neither could persuade him to return to the red keep it has been too long since i have seen my kingdom and listen to my people his grace told them king's landing will do well enough in your hands and your mothers when at last he had exhausted the hospitality of the westerman he did not return to king's landing but moved on directly to the reach flying vermithor from crackhaul to old oak to begin a second progress even as the first was ending by that time the queen's absence had been noticed and his grace would oft find himself seated next to some lissa maid or handsome widow at feast or riding beside them when hawking or hunting but he took no notice of any of them at bandalon when lord blackbar's youngest daughter was so bold as the seat herself in his lab an attempt to feed him a grape he brushed her hand aside and said forgive me but i have a queen and no taste for power morse for the entire year of 89 ac the king remained on the move at highgarden he was joined for a time by his granddaughter princess rhaenys who flew to his side on melees the red queen together they visited the shield islands where the king had ever been before jiharis made a point of landing on all four shields it was on green shield in lord chester's hall that princess rhaenys told him of her plans to marry and received the king's blessing you could not have chosen a better man he said his journeys finally ended in an old town where he visited with his daughter septa magel was blessed by the high septon and feasted by the conclave an enjoyed attorney staged in his honor by lord hightower sir ryan redwine again emerged as champion the maesters of that time referred to the estrangement betwixt the king and queen as the great rift the passage of time and a subsequent quarrel that was near as bitter gave it a new name the first quarrel that is how it is known to this day we shall speak of the second quarrel in good time it was septa magel who bridged the rift this is foolish father she said to him rhaenys is to be married next year and it should be a great occasion she will want all of us there including both you and mother the archmaesters call you the conciliator i have heard it is time that you conciliate it the scolding had the desired effect a fortnight later king jairus returned at last to king's landing and queen alsain returned from her own self-imposed exile on dragonstone what words pass between them we can never know but for a good while afterward they were once again as close they had been before in the 90th year after aegon's conquest the king and queen shared one of their last good times together as they celebrated the wedding of their eldest grandchild princess rhaenys to cordless valerion of driftmark lord of the tides at 7 and 30 the sea snake was already hailed as the greatest seafarer westeros had ever known but with his nine great voyages behind him he had come home to mary and make a family only you could have won me away from the sea he told the princess i came back from the ends of the earth for you rhaenys at six and ten was a fearless young beauty and more than a match for her mariner a dragon rider since the age of 13 she insisted upon arriving for the wedding on melees the red queen the magnificent scarlet she-dragon that had once borne her on alyssa we can go back to the ends of the earth together she promised corliss but i'll get there first as i'll be flying that was a good day queen allison would say with a sad smile through the years that remained to her she was 54 that year but sad to say she did not have many good days left it is not within the scope of this history to chronicle the endless wars intrigues and rivalries of the free cities of essos save when they impinge on the fortunes of house targaryen in the seven kingdoms one such time occurred during the wars 91 to 92 ac during what is known as the mirish bloodbath we shall not trouble you with the details suffice it is to say that in the city of mir two rival factions vied for supremacy there were assassinations riots poisonings rapes hangings tortures and sea battles before one side could emerge supreme the losing faction driven from the city tried to establish themselves first upon the stepstones only to be hounded from there as well when the archan of tyrosh made common cause with the league of pirate kings in their desperation the mere men next turned to the island of tarth where their landings took the evenstar by surprise in a short time they had taken the entire eastern side of the island by that time the mirrors were little more than pirates themselves a ragged band of rogues neither the king nor his council felt it would require much to drive them back into the sea prince eamon would lead the assault it was decided the mirror men did have some strength at sea so the sea snake would first need to bring the valerian fleet south to protect lord bormond as he crossed the tarth with his stormlanders to join with evenstar's own levees the combined strength would be more than sufficient to retake all of tarth from the mirror's pirates and if there proved to be unexpected difficulties prince aemon would have caraxies he does love to burn the prince said lord corliss and his fleet set sail from driftmark on the ninth day of the third moon of 92ac prince aymond followed a few hours later after bidding farewell to lady joslin and their daughter rhaenys the princess had just learned she was expecting else she would have accompanied her sire on melees into battle the prince said as if i would have ever permitted that you have your own battle to fight lord corliss will want a son i'm sure and i would like a grandson those were the last words he would ever speak to his daughter caraxes swiftly outdistanced the sea snake in his fleet dropping down out of the sky on tarth lord cameron the even star of tarth had fallen back into the spine of the mountains that ran down the center of his island and established a camp in a hidden valley from which he could look down on the mirish movements below prince eamonn met him there and the two made plans together whilst karaxis devoured half a dozen goats but the even star's camp was not as hidden as he had hoped and the smoke from the dragon's fires drew the eyes of a pair of mirror scouts who were creeping through the heights unawares one of them recognized the even star as he strode through camp at dusk talking with prince aemon the men of mir are in different sailors and feeble soldiers the weapons of choice are dirk dagger and crossbow preferably poisoned one of the mirror scouts wound his crossbow now behind the rocks where he was hidden rising he took aim on the evenstar 100 yards below and loosed his bolt dusk in distance made his aim less certain and the bolt missed lord cameron and struck prince eamonn standing at his side the iron bolt punched through the prince's throat and out the back of his neck the prince of dragonstone fell to his knees and grasped the crossbow bolt as if to pull it from his throat but his strength was gone aemon targaryen died struggling to speak drowned on his own blood he was 37 years old how can my words tell of the grief that swept the seven kingdoms then of the pain felt by king jiharis and queen elisane of lady jocelyn's empty bed and bitter tears and the way princess rhaenys wept to know that her father would never hold the child she was carrying far easier to speak on prince balon's wrath and how he came down upon tarth on vegar howling for vengeance the mere ships burned as prince maurian ships had burned nine years earlier and when the even star and lord borman descended on them from the mountains they had nowhere to fly they were cut down by thousands and left to rot along the beaches so every wave that washed ashore for days was tinged with pink balon the brave played his part in the slaughter with dark sister in his hand when he returned to king's landing with his brother's corpse the small folk lined the streets screaming his name and hailing him as a hero but it is said that when he saw his mother again he fell into her arms and wept i slew a thousand of them he said but it will not bring it back and the queen stroked his hair and said i know i know seasons came and went in the years that followed there were hot days and warm days and days when the salt wind blew bracing off the sea there were fields of flowers in the spring and bountiful harvests and golden autumn afternoons all across the realm the roads crept onward and new bridges spanned old streams the king took no pleasure in any of it so as far as men could tell it is always winter now he said to septon barth one night when he had drunk too much since eamon's death he always drank a cup or three of honeyed wine at night to help him sleep in 93 ac prince balon's 16 year old son viserys entered the dragon pit and claimed velaryon the old dragon had stopped growing at last but he was sluggish and heavy and hard to rouse and he struggled when viserys urged him up into the air the young prince flew thrice around the city before landing again he had intended to fly to dragonstone he told his father afterward but he did not think the black dread had the strength for it less than a year later belarion was gone the last living creature in all the world who saw valyria in its glory wrote septon barth barth himself died four years later in 98 ac grand maester elsar preceded him by half a year lord redwine had died in 89 ac his son sir robert soon thereafter new men took their places but jaharis was truly the old king by then and sometimes he would walk into the council chamber and think who are these men do i know them his grace grieved for prince aemon until the end of his days but the old king never dreamed that eamon's death in 92 ac would be like the hell horns of valyrian legend bringing death and destruction down on all those who heard their sound the last years of alisain targaryen were sad and lonely ones in her youth good queen alzane had loved her subjects lords and commons alike she had loved her women's courts listening learning and doing what she could to make the realm a kinder place she had seen more of the seven kingdoms than any queen before or since slept in a hundred castles charmed a hundred lords made a hundred marriages she had loved music she loved to dance had loved to read and oh she had loved to fly silver wing had carried her to old town to the wall and to a thousand places in between and alsane saw them all as few others ever would looking down from above the clouds all these loves were lost to her in the last decade of her life my uncle maegor the cruel alisaine was heard to say but age is crueler worn out from childbirth travel and grief she grew thin and frail after aemon's death climbing hills became a trial to her and in 95 ac she slipped and fell on the serpentine steps breaking her hip thereafter she walked with a cane her hearing began to fail as well music was lost to her and when she tried to sit in on council meetings with the king she could no longer understand half of what was said she was far too unsteady to fly silver wing last carried her into the sky in 93 ac when she came to earth again and climbed painfully from her dragon's back the queen wept more than all of these she had loved her children no mother ever loved a child more grandmaster benefit once told her before the shivers carried him away in the last days of her life queen allison reflected on his words he was wrong i think she wrote for surely the mother above loved my children more she took so many of them away from me no mother should ever have to burn her child the queen said at her funeral pyre for her son velaryon but of the 13 children she bored to king jiharis only three of them would survive her aegon gaiman and valerion died his babes the shivers took daenerys at the age of six a crossbow slew prince eamonn alyssa and daela had died in child bed visera drunk in the street sept amagel the gentle soul died in 96 ac her arms and legs turned to stone by grayscale for she had spent her last years nursing those afflicted with the horrible condition saddest of all was the loss of princess gail the winter child born in 80 ac when princess alisaine was 44 and thought to be well past her childbearing years a sweet natured girl but frail and somewhat simple-minded she remained with the queen long after her other children had grown and gone but in 99 ac she vanished from court and soon afterward it was announced that she had died of a summer fever only after both her parents were gone did the true tale come out seduced and abandoned by a traveling singer the princess had given birth to a stillborn son then overwhelmed by grief walked into the waters of blackwater bay and drowned some say that alsain never recovered from that loss for her winter child alone had been a true companion during her declining years sarah still lived somewhere in volantis she had departed least some years before an infamous woman but a wealthy one but she was dead to jiharis and the letters alisene sent her secretly from time to time all went unanswered vagon was an archmaester of the citadel a cold and distant son he had grown to be a cold and distant man he wrote as a sun aunt his words were dutiful but there were no warmth to them it had been years since alisaine had last seen his face only balon the brave remained near her to the end her spring prince visited her as often as he could and always want to smile from her but balon was the prince of dragonstone handed the king forever coming and going sitting at his father's side at council treating with the lords you will be a great king even greater than your father alisaine told him the last time they were together she did not know how could she know after the death of princess gayle king's landing in the red keep became unbearable to alisane she could no longer serve as she once had as a partner to the king in his labors and the court was full of strangers whose names alsane could not quite recall seeking peace she turned once more to dragonstone where she had spent the happiest days of her life with jiharis between their first and second marriages the old king would join her there when he could how is it that i am the old king now but you are still the good queen he asked her once alsain laughed i am old as well but i am still younger than you alisain targaryen died on dragonstone the first day of the seventh moon in 100 ac a full century after aegon's conquest she was 64 years old that was chapter 11 of fire and blood make sure to subscribe to this channel to read
