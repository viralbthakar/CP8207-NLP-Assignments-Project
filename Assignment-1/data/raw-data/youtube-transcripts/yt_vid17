 you know I'm notorious for my love of gray characters and one of the greatest characters and entire story Westeros is daemon targaryen the rogue Prince we we took one of the sidebars made a separate story out of it the rogue Prince daemon is the younger brother of King Viserys the first for a time he was the heir to the throne when Viserys had no children and then Viserys started having children and he stopped being the heir to the throne he's notorious bad boy a rogue in every sense of the word he was a rival for the Sarah's sister and his own niece rhaenyra and then later he became the husband of her Neera he switched his side several times you never know what side he's going to come down on he's a very colorful and unpredictable character and I think he has to rank up there is my favorite but the the book is full of what I hope are interesting characters Lari on the black grid he is the oldest and largest of the Targaryen dragons he's the only one born in valaria when the Targaryen fled valaria before the doom they brought I believe I say five dragons with them one by one those dragons died on Dragonstone only balerion survived past a conquest and to be the the leading and most powerful dragon of the age so he's gigantic and old and difficult to master or tame he was a God's dragon Aegon the dragon Aegon the conquerer the founder of the whole Targaryen dynasty and after a gods death various other riders a road or attempted to ride balerion some more happily than others but he is certainly a legend among the the Dragons of of the Targaryen dynasty he was the Lord of Dragonstone one of a succession after the after the Targaryen is fled valaria and settled on Dragonstone in advance of the doom a number of them came and went mostly their eyes still gazed east toward Essos but as the years pass and son succeeded father and brother succeeded brother they began to take more interest in the affairs of Westeros and Aegon finally decided to take over Westeros and unify the Seven Kingdoms that existed at a time under a single rule there is a lot of speculation that in some sense he saw what was coming 300 years later and wanted to unify the Seven Kingdoms to be better prepared for the threat that he eventually saw coming from the north the threat that we're dealing with in a Song of Ice and Fire yes Joe Harris the conciliator the old king was the longest-reigning of the Targaryen monarchs he took the crown when he was 14 years old and held it I believe for 55 years and Alison was his sister and his wife theirs was a great romance if you'll accept that an incestuous relationship can be a great romance and they were for most of their reigns they were they were partners they worked together I mean Joe Harris ruled but Alison had an immense amount of influence over him and on a number of occasions he took her advice or passed laws that that she urged yeah thing about Daenerys of course is she lives in a time when the dragons have been gone for hundreds of years no one has seen the living dragons since the events chronicled in fire and blood so this is a book that Daenerys actually might benefit from reading but she has no access to archmaester guild Dean's crumbling manuscripts so she's operating on her own there and maybe she understood a few things more about dragons her own history and in Essos would have gone a little differently but we shall see fans all have to make up their own mind about that [Music]
