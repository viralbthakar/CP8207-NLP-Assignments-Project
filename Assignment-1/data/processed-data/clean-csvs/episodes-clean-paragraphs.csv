101,scroll jaehaerys open giving final result identifies viserys parent jaehaerys son baelon baelon sister wife alyssa later episode viserys say dialogue name newborn son baelon specify naming father
102,phrasing son may caused confusion whether jaehaerys son cut tv canon official guide confirms jaehaerys 13 child three son survived cradle third son vaegon became archmaester could inherit addition fact older brother surviving child stronger claim
103,detail great council harrenhal somewhat condensed tv version book final two candidate viserys rhaenys son laenor rhaenys counted one potential candidate 14 total still broadly speaking seen vote bloodline viserys rhaenys tv series also say 14 candidate unclear laenor laena included count book though 11 14 candidate ever described book complete list disrupt

420,first episode alicent hightower criston cole harrold westerling appear
421,show follows tradition game throne least one king killed per season except season 7 season one king died viserys
422,dragonstone
423,daemon claim alicent murdered viserys according fire blood one ever claimed viserys murdered whether alicent anyone else mushroom writes since unreliable historian general according book many fable partake fool fevered imaginings historical truth statement questionable even king landing viserys died
424,daemon book rhaenys list seventeen dragon enemy disposal dragon used rider past wild dragon mention dragon name completed according book
425,green dreamfyre vhagar sunfyre adult one tessarion
426,black syrax caraxes meleys vermax arrax tyraxes moondancer
427,unclaimed seasmoke vermithor silverwing
428,laenor velaryon king jaehaerys targaryen queen alysanne targaryen rider dragon respectively death one replaced till beginning war
429,wild dragon cannibal sheepstealer grey ghost
430,book rhaenys mentioned one dragon stormcloud however stormcloud status unclear given aegon younger far younger outbreak dance book counterpart possible stormcloud either hatchling far small ridden hatched yet
431,addition aforementioned eighteen dragon book mention two morghul shrycox alive beginning war thus total number dragon point twenty dragon hatched war young ridden participate war one mentioned name morning
432,book rhaenyra pointed actually five dragon green four dragon since strong enough fly six riderless dragon claimed yet moondancer stormcloud claimed ridden yet
433,rhaenyra act similarly daenerys stormborn reject suggestion send dragon immediately attack king landing since wish kill innocent people state wish rule kingdom ash bone similarly daenerys word queen ash
434,book rhaenyra never said word lord celtigar urged fly king landing reduce ash bone corlys rhaenyra daemon rejected suggestion
435,fourth time song ice fire mentioned show following heir dragon king narrow sea lord tide
436,seems corlys resent daemon killing vaemond lord tide maybe recognizes viserys could dismiss vaemond obnoxious behavior unpunished vaemond haste bury corlys claim seat rhaenys say
437,rhaenyra receives alicent page rhaenyra tore ten thousand ship heir dragon maybe alicent meant remind rhaenya time friend thus persuade resolve conflict without bloodshed
438,indeed alicent intention must missed irony passage torn page nymeria formidable warrior consistently defied patriarchal rule custom world took dorne survived invasion uprising assassination attempt succeeded daughter contrast inheritance law region westeros according male heir ahead female heir thus passage would encourage rhaenyra fight iron throne rather submit half brother
439,encounter dragonstone greatly resembles encounter rogue prince place leader rhaenyra arrives riding syrax event resolved non violently difference time rhaenyra side daemon impressive arrival meant discourage otto retinue rather discourage daemon
440,daemon act episode consistently conduct previous episode quarrelsome rash ever parallel book scene however acted surprisingly restrained staid manner character agreed wife try resolving conflict word went battle first rally supporter rejected lord celtigar suggestion send dragon destroy king landing immediately pointing enemy fearsome dragon could kill dragon would sacrifice needlessly unless alternative
441,storm end
442,deadly encounter aemond luke confirms viserys said heir dragon idea control dragon illusion power man never trifled valyrian dragonlords could control dragon using binding spell magical horn targaryens migrated westeros neither
443,daenerys realizes dance dragon chapter 71 daenerys x drogon allows ride back make fly back meereen also parallel scene mother mercy
444,two sword drogon snap daenerys try keep bullying lamb brother jorah mormont state dragon khaleesi never tamed even mother
445,conclusion dragon first foremost wild animal fully tamed true many animal real life well dragon intelligent rather mindless beast form bond people enough trust let ride back even dragon bonded reared birth 100 loyal domesticated capable ignoring disobeying outright command arrax vhagar gave baser instinct attacked threatened even real life domesticated animal bond rider either insufficient stop outright ignored
446,scene storm end resembles scene form dance dragon chapter 19 davos iii davos arrives white harbor persuade lord wyman manderly support stannis dismay find envoy house frey already lord manderly agreed wed granddaughter frey lord manderly treat open hostility attending people taunt reluctantly admits stannis nothing offer lord manderly except avenging son wendel murdered red wedding one frey threaten davos draw sword lord manderly forbids spill blood court
447,following davos pov chapter revealed lord manderly hostility toward davos pretence make frey spy court believe loyal crown actually want settle score responsible wendel death agrees support stannis condition davos find rickon stark unclear whether lord borros baratheon acted genuinely secretly support black
448,confrontation lucerys aemond resembles willem blackwood jerrel bracken king narrow sea confrontation take place storm end involve older youth taunting younger insult craven involve drawing weapon sword younger dagger older result death however confrontation lucerys aemond never come blow inside storm end younger boy dy
449,killing luke aemond become kinslayer even intend book proud killing lost control dragon initiated encounter thus responsibility
450,aemond rash behavior episode slightly resembles joffrey baratheon foolish decision execute eddard stark ruined chance resolve conflict peacefully ignited extremely destructive war cost life countless innocent people
451,altered deleted scene
452,following unused monologue written rhaenyra visenya daughter born abomination mayhaps warning god augury born day father died crown stolen would called visenya meant david j peterson commissioned translate monologue high valyrian 1

648,title episode refers driftmark island seat house velaryon high tide castle driftmark located
649,first episode house dragon titled ancestral seat westerosi noble house two episode game throne shared title house seat dragonstone house targaryen winterfell house stark
650,unlike several episode season set entirely around king landing entire episode set driftmark island barring rhaenyra daemon wedding briefly seen end might actually dragonstone specified
651,rhaenyra tell daemon need support since face green alone first time green supporter alicent son aegon identified name opposing faction black named screen yet behind scene video episode however emma arcy rhaenyra refers green black moreover within episode helaena make cryptic prophetic reference dragon flesh targaryens weaving thread black green
652,book give specific detail funeral practice house velaryon tv show invented inter remains sarcophagus drop ocean specific cliff driftmark rest sea ancestor targaryens typically burn dead married targaryens appears laena laenor cremated book
653,vaemond eulogy prominently mention merling king local mythological figure land around narrow sea according legend velaryons given driftwood throne gift merling king figure valyrian religion local deity got mixed velaryons cultural practice located fringe valyrian domain
654,baela rhaena arrive mother home driftmark meet grandparent rhaenys corlys first time episode somewhat change book daemon laena actually moved back driftmark pentos one year girl born twin book thus baela rhaena spent early life driftmark book already knew rhaenyra son tv version baela jace meet first time funeral seem bond shared grief
655,rhaenyra remark daemon laenor actually try conceive child together never worked rhaenyra belief harwin strong father child unknown objectively true possibility remains could mistaken much ambiguous book
656,rhaenys insists rhaenyra son really laenor baela named heir driftmark eldest daughter laena ahead corlys younger brother vaemond nephew book westeros except dorne follow male preference primogeniture still primogeniture lord daughter inherits ahead lord younger brother thus daughter corlys daughter still stand ahead corlys younger brother line succession rule strictly applied new targaryen dynasty rhaenys named heir king jaehaerys death father aemon crown prince eldest son instead passed viserys son jaehaerys second son baelon baela namesake pretext unbroken male line descent thus rhaenys rightful heir along laenor legitimate child technically even according male preference primogeniture baela would actually rightful heir iron throne
657,wake scene present juxtaposition larys strong secret nephew lucerys alicent note larys almost gleaming pride recently becoming new lord harrenhal secretly killing father older brother contrast corlys tell luke one day one day ruler driftmark house velaryon luke say want would inherit rule corlys laenor dead
658,daemon naked beach scene seen back several burn scar continues show targaryens actually invulnerable fire seen earlier daemon took wound shoulder flaming arrow third episode game throne made change season 6 daenerys targaryen always invulnerable fire even though george r r martin repeatedly said survival drogo funeral pyre hatched dragon egg one time miraculous event due magical spell
659,end episode viserys seen kissing ring finger belonged wife aemma arryn arryn falcon sigil death laena heavily reminds viserys aemma death much mind one point accidentally call alicent aemma

661,filming location
662,filming location exterior high tide castle driftmark cgi matte painting famous castle st michael mount south coast cornwall england high tide called tidal island land bridge connecting main island low tide get subsumed ocean tide rise rather digitally add element production team simply found castle actually located real life tidal island willing allow filming extensive spy photo laena funeral scene leaked back filming series began may 2021 scene rhaenyra daemon alone beach aemond finding vhagar separate beach filmed hollywell beach north coast cornwall 45 minute drive st michael mount
663,greg yaitanes originally intended direct episode unable due scheduling issue last minute location shoot second episode take place immediately miguel sapochnik supposed direct busy different shoot yaitanes step film second episode based sapochnik storyboards yaitanes swapped back directing duty episode 7 sapochnik though return yaitanes got direct season finale 1
664,successful premiere house dragon resulted quick renewal hbo director miguel sapochnik announced would returning work season 2 co showrunner ryan condal acknowledged interview sapochnik never intended stay potential second season citing extreme exhaustion need break though neither ruled sapochnik returning franchise point later season make driftmark chronologically last episode sapochnik directed franchise though final wrap actually filming one two episode directed season
665,behind scene video explains actually first episode filmed production first season indeed first entire series whole tv series filmed order cast inevitably le familiar first episode compared later filming time refine play recognizing showrunners decided work people funeral often know say would expected awkward interaction made funeral episode first one filmed order mask cast unfamiliarity began example matt smith daemon paddy considine viserys interaction wake awkwardly paced compared conversation later filmed earlier episode fit daemon would loss word wife funeral
666,stated behind scene video absolute first scene filmed episode thus entire tv series laena funeral scene sarcophagus dropped water almost entire cast side targaryen family gathered wake scene took four day film
667,sarcophagus actually built fiberglass stone buoyant could recovered take camera switch underwater position show sarcophagus sinking switch digital effect
668,stated behind scene video absolute first scene filmed episode thus entire tv series laena funeral scene sarcophagus dropped water almost entire cast side targaryen family gathered wake scene took four day film
669,according behind scene video location filming st michael mount resulted numerous logistical difficulty 2
670,due nature tidal island material could driven site narrow window day sent week advance rush acquire new material issue came
671,coastline st michael mount almost entirely sheer cliff beach scene filmed separately northern cornwall therefore platform funeral wake scene take place built production team complicated fact legally drill rock island attach pole strap meant could build large platform entire wake scene contains 40 people crammed small cliffside courtyard platform without enough space fit dolly crane camera change elevation camera propped ladder
672,tidal island st michael mount course famous rapidly changing tide level presented major challenge scene continuity also intermittently raining throughout exterior shoot even though supposed take place bright sunny day wait right hour film sun tide level ultimately funeral scene took full day film wake scene took four day film
673,filming relatively brief funeral scene difficult took 20 minute retrieve sarcophagus water reset take
674,combined storm tide level surrounding bay actually major tourist area meant digitally remove tourist boat surrounding water well modern town opposing coastline
675,aemond fight
676,book aemond actually got right eye slashed left eye slashed tv series possibly done safety reason adult actor playing aemond right handed would difficult see sword going right eye covered
677,book rhaenyra three son fight aemond jace luke joff though joff contribution fight minimal given three year old jace six luke five aemond ten year old tv series altered age slightly jace luke closer nine eight joff significantly younger still baby tv version therefore swapped joff added girl baela rhaena around four happened book also older tv show version aemond still ten year old thus largest child despite four one fight strength side roughly even
678,entire incident book tv show child two rival family getting fight adult arguing front king parallel arya stark got fight joffrey baratheon resulted direwolf biting mother cersei lannister demanding punishment
