Biography
Background
Rhaenyra is the daughter and only surviving child of King Viserys I and Aemma Arryn.[4] She rides the dragon Syrax.[5]
House of the Dragon: Season 1
Rhaenyra returns to King's Landing after riding Syrax and visits her mother Aemma, who is heavily pregnant. While Rhaenyra is not very enthused at the prospect of having her own children, her mother reminds her of her duty as a princess, and that the childbed is a royal woman's battlefield. Rhaenyra later greets her uncle Daemon in the throne room, where he presents her with a gift acquired on his recent journey; a necklace made of Valyrian steel.[5]
Later that evening, Rhaenyra, and her friend, Lady Alicent Hightower spend time in the godswood, where Rhaenyra hopes that her unborn sibling is a boy, for the sake of her father, Viserys I's happiness, ignoring Alicent's remarks that a son would overshadow her in the line of succession.[5]
Rhaenyra is present in the royal box when her father commences the Heir's Tournament, where he announces that Aemma has gone into labor. Rhaenyra and Alicent are intrigued by a new contender in the tournament, Ser Criston Cole, after his victories against Lord Boremund Baratheon, and another Baratheon. Rhaenyra witnesses the duel between Ser Criston, and her uncle, Prince Daemon, in which Criston emerges victorious. He then asks Rhaenyra for her favor. She then tosses down a floral wreath to him, and bids Criston good luck in the rest of the tournament. In the middle of the tournament, the spectators in the royal box are informed of Queen Aemma's death in childbirth.[5]
Several days later, the royal court gathers outside the city walls of King's Landing for the funeral of Rhaenyra's mother, Aemma, and her infant brother, Prince Baelon. Rhaenyra bitterly ponders to her uncle, Daemon, whether her father finally found happiness in the few hours that Baelon lived, and laments that she will never make her father truly happy, as she is not a son. She then sets her mother and brother's funeral pyre ablaze, with a command of "Dracarys" to Syrax.[5]
After Viserys disinherits Daemon, he summons Rhaenyra to Balerion's shrine, to her confusion due to Viserys's recent lack of contact with her. Viserys then voices his intention to name Rhaenyra as his heir, and informs her of Aegon the Conqueror's vision, which he dubbed "The Song of Ice and Fire," which every legitimate heir to the Iron Throne has been informed of to ensure Westeros's readiness for the evil that Aegon foresaw. Some time later, the realm's nobility swears fealty to Viserys and Rhaenyra, and Rhaenyra is officially named Princess of Dragonstone.[5]
Six months after her mother's funeral, Rhaenyra speaks up at a Small Council meeting to voice her opinion on how to handle the situation in the Stepstones, suggesting dragonriders be sent to force the Triarchy's surrender. Instead of taking her advice, Viserys tasks her with filling the vacant spot on the Kingsguard, after Ser Ryam Redwyne's death. Ignoring advice from Otto Hightower that she choose a knight that would earn them a strong alliance, she selects Ser Criston Cole, due to him being the only knight being considered to have seen actual combat, rather than tourney fighting.[6]
Later that day, Rhaenyra visits a sept with Alicent, where she vents her frustration about the Small Council plotting to replace her as heir. The two pray to the Mother, with Alicent teaching Rhaenyra— who does not worship the Seven—how to do so. Rhaenyra tearfully expresses her wish that Viserys see her as more than his little girl.[6]
That night, Rhaenyra and Viserys share an awkward dinner, during which they discuss the appointment of Ser Criston Cole on the Kingsguard and briefly bond over their shared love of Aemma. When she tries to apologize for speaking out at the Small Council earlier, he dismisses it, stating that she is young, and will learn propriety in time.[6]
Rhaenyra and her cousin, the Princess Rhaenys Targaryen, discuss Rhaenyra's succession to the Iron Throne, and the possibility of her displacement as heir to the Iron Throne due to her sex, with Rhaenys bluntly telling Rhaenyra that the men of Westeros would sooner put the realm to the torch than allow a woman to ascend the Iron Throne.[6]
At the Small Council, Viserys and Rhaenyra get word from a Dragonkeeper Elder that Daemon has stolen a dragon egg from the Dragonpit, namely the one Rhaenyra had picked out for her brother, Baelon. Despite not being given leave to go to Dragonstone, Rhaenyra flies there atop Syrax to persuade Daemon to relinquish the dragon egg, and to leave the castle. She succeeds in getting the dragon egg back without bloodshed, but fails to get Daemon to leave Dragonstone. When Rhaenyra returns to King's Landing, Viserys angrily chides her for leaving and endangering herself, though he does credit her being the only person able to retrieve the egg without bloodshed. Viserys insists that because Rhaenyra is his only heir, the Targaryen line is vulnerable, and though he insists that he will not unname Rhaenyra as his heir, even if his new wife were to give him sons, he must ensure the continuation of the Targaryen line.[6]
At a Small Council meeting the next morning, Viserys announces his intention to marry Lady Alicent Hightower, which infuriates and disgusts Rhaenyra, hurt by her father and friend keeping this from her.[6]
Three years later, Rhaenyra's relationships with both her father and Alicent, now queen of the Seven Kingdoms, have soured, and is now disinclined to listen to either of them. She attends a royal hunt with her family to celebrate the second nameday of her half-brother, Prince Aegon Targaryen. At the camp, she is proposed to by Lord Jason Lannister, to which she declines. She then gets into a terse confrontation with her father, realizing that he intends to marry her off to one of the noblemen of Westeros, causing her to run off into the Kingswood. Ser Criston Cole goes after her, and she contemplates whether the realm will actually accept her as queen.[1]
After agreeing to get married to perpetuate the Targaryen line, she goes on a tour of Westeros to pick a lord of her choosing to wed. However, she cuts the progress short at Storm's End. Rhaenyra reunites with her uncle, Daemon, after four years, and he takes her through the Street of Silk late in the night, where she witnesses the true nature of King's Landing, and the smallfolk's opinion of her and her position in society. Rhaenyra and Daemon then go to a brothel, where Rhaenyra witnesses the pleasures of sex. She and Daemon then proceed to couple together, but Daemon is rendered impotent and leaves her in the brothel. Rhaenyra, still sexually aroused, seduces Ser Criston Cole, and loses her virginity to him.[7]
Rhaenyra and Daemon are seen together by a Lyseni boy, who brings word of this to Mysaria. Mysaria then orders the boy to inform Otto Hightower, who in turn brings the news to Rhaenyra's father Viserys. Alicent, who overheard the conversation between Viserys and Otto, confronts Rhaenyra about this, but she vehemently denies the allegations against her and Daemon. Viserys then confronts Rhaenyra about this, and to avoid scandal, he orders Rhaenyra to wed Ser Laenor Velaryon. She reluctantly agrees, on the condition that Viserys dismisses Otto as his Hand. That night, Grand Maester Mellos, at Viserys's behest, gives Rhaenyra moon tea as a precaution.[7]
Rhaenyra travels with her father to Driftmark to discuss a marriage alliance between her and Laenor. The two walk on a nearby beach, where Rhaenyra expresses that she is aware that the two of them love other people, and that he is no more enthusiastic about this marriage pact than she is. She proposes a mutual arrangement: they will perform their duty for their respective families to marry and produce heirs, but otherwise they will both continue having their own private romantic relationships. Later, as Viserys's ship heads back to King's Landing, Rhaenyra is approached by Criston on the deck. He tells her he knows she doesn't love Laenor and for years she's talked about her fear of being trapped in a loveless arranged marriage. Instead, he pleads with her to flee with him into exile beyond Westeros, where they can be married. Rhaenyra insists that she has duties to her family and to the realm that keep her from eloping with him. However, she doesn't consider this a problem because she just worked out an "understanding" with Laenor. Criston becomes agitated about being just Rhaenyra's "whore", hoping that he could restore some of his lost honor by marrying her. Rhaenyra begins to explain again that this is impossible, but Criston storms off.[8]

Joffrey refers to Rhaenyra while giving Margaery a tour in the Great Sept of Baelor.[9]
Personality
Rhaenyra is strong-willed and independent.[10] Rhaenyra rejects the idea of being a lady and is more interested in flying on top of her dragon Syrax having adventures and choosing her own destiny.[5] During her youth, Rhaenyra was in love with her friend Alicent, and a long series of small rejections by Alicent culminating in her marriage to Viserys made Rhaenyra increasingly insecure, fueling the division and jealousy between them.[11][disputed; see talk page]
Family tree
1 Jaehaerys had thirteen children in all. For simplicity, only the direct ancestors of future generations are on this family tree and they are not in the exact order of birth. The thirteen children in correct order are: Aegon, Daenerys, Aemon, Baelon, Alyssa, Maegelle, Vaegon, Daella, Saera, Viserra, Gaemon, Valerion, and Gael.
2 While Jacaerys, Lucerys, and Joffrey are officially Laenor's, he and Rhaenyra never had any biological issue. His three sons are in fact fathered by Harwin Strong.

Behind the scenes
Rhaenyra Targaryen was revealed to be a lead character in House of the Dragon on July 18, 2020. On December 11, 2020, HBO announced that Emma D'Arcy had signed on for the series. The character breakdown reads as follows:
- "The king's first-born child. She is of pure Valyrian blood, and she is a dragonrider. Many would say that Rhaenyra was born with everything… but she was not born a man."
- ―HBO
On July 6, 2021, it was reported that Milly Alcock was set to portray young Rhaenyra.
In the books
In Fire & Blood, Rhaenyra was the daughter of King Viserys I, and his only child to survive the cradle by his wife, Aemma of House Arryn. Viserys's younger brother Daemon was his closest male heir, but many at court felt he was so unruly that he was unfit to sit the throne, so Viserys officially named Rhaenyra his heir. This decision was controversial, as it contradicted the principle of male-preference proximity which had put Viserys himself on the throne, instead of his older first cousin Rhaenys Targaryen (who according to primogeniture should have been the heir).
Rhaenyra was therefore raised expecting to one day sit the Iron Throne herself, becoming somewhat pampered and arrogant, though also receiving an education in government as befitting the heir to the throne. From an early age, Rhaenyra regularly sat at the foot of the Iron Throne while her father held royal court, and her father also regularly brought her to meetings of the Small Council. A precocious young girl, in her childhood she was known as "the Realm's Delight". The year before her mother died, Rhaenyra also become a dragonrider, claiming Syrax as her mount. One of Rhaenyra's personal tics was also that she tended to nervously play with her hands (or the rings on them) when she was thinking.

Notes
- ↑ Viserys states that Rhaenyra is 15 years old in "The Rogue Prince," which takes place in 112 AC. "The Heirs of the Dragon" takes place earlier in 112 AC, and in that episode she is 14 according to Emily Carey. (interview with Insider, Popsugar, and Metacritic). She was therefore born in 97 AC, same as in the books. Alicent Hightower is the same age as Rhaenyra according to the interview previously linked.
