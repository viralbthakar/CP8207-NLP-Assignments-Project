House of the Dragon: Season 1
After Daemon is banished from King's Landing by Viserys, he leaves on Caraxes with Mysaria.[2]
During a confrontation between Daemon and Otto Hightower at Dragonstone, Caraxes shrieks and crawls forward to reveal himself at the top of a cliff, prompting Otto to order his men to sheathe their weapons.[3]
Caraxes is used by Daemon during the War for the Stepstones. Despite the distinct advantage a powerful dragon gives in battle, his effectiveness was suppressed by the caves along the coast of Bloodstone, where Craghas Drahar and his soldiers retreated to. During one such night raid, Caraxes and Daemon ambush the Triarchy forces but can only cause minimal casualties when the Crabfeeder and his men hide from the dragonfire. Subsequently, numerous flaming arrows are fired at them, confusing Caraxes and wounding Daemon, forcing them to retreat.[4]
Caraxes and Daemon fly over Rhaenyra Targaryen's ship during their return to King's Landing.[5]
Caraxes flies alongside Vhagar in the skies above Pentos, during the self-exile of Daemon and his second wife Laena Velaryon.[6]
Caraxes stays at High Tide along with several other dragons during the funeral of Laena Velaryon.[7]
At Dragonstone, Daemon summons Caraxes to intimidate Kingsguard knights Ser Steffon Darklyn and Ser Lorent Marbrand and to remind them of their oaths.[8]
Behind the scenes
The visual design of Caraxes is inspired by a loong (Chinese dragon).[9]
In the books
In Fire & Blood, Caraxes was one of the older and larger dragons during the Dance of the Dragons. His scales were colored red, leading to him being called "the Blood Wyrm".
Caraxes's first rider was Aemon Targaryen, the Prince of Dragonstone and King Jaehaerys I's eldest son. One of the fiercest dragons among the younger generation, he was given his nickname by the Dragonkeepers, the order of guards created by King Jaehaerys to guard the newly-completed Dragonpit, and later saw his first conflict during the Fourth Dornish War, when King Jaehaerys (astride Vermithor), Prince Aemon (astride Caraxes) and Prince Baelon, Aemon's younger brother (astride Vhagar), descended upon the Dornish fleet and destroyed it without suffering a single loss. Caraxes would later accompany Aemon to Tarth when an invasion of Myrish pirates caused the route of the Evenstar. However, Caraxes's fires drew the attention of the Myrish onto the Westerosi camp and a crossbowmen took a shot at the Evenstar, but missed and hit Aemon instead. The Prince of Dragonstone died of the wound, leaving Caraxes riderless until Daemon Targaryen, the younger son of Aemon's brother Baelon, claimed him.
