0,56,31,0,56,34,I will do my duty as heir
0,56,34,0,56,35,and wed Ser Laenor.
0,56,37,0,56,40,But you must first do yours as king.
0,56,51,0,56,53,"- (door closes)
- Your Grace."
0,56,55,0,56,57,Five days.
0,57,0,0,57,2,"I'm sorry, Your Grace?"
0,57,2,0,57,4,"King Viserys:
Though it was some time ago."
0,57,5,0,57,8,The details... they fade in memory.
0,57,8,0,57,12,"My father was a hale and healthy
warrior and dragonrider"
0,57,12,0,57,14,at the peak of his abilities.
0,57,14,0,57,16,Jaehaerys named a great royal hunt
0,57,16,0,57,19,"to celebrate him being
named the Hand of the King."
0,57,20,0,57,24,"Five days later my...
my father lay dead."
0,57,26,0,57,28,Tourneys last longer.
0,57,29,0,57,32,"Baelon the Brave,"
0,57,32,0,57,34,"rider of Vhagar,"
0,57,34,0,57,36,heir to the Iron Throne...
0,57,37,0,57,39,dead of a burst belly.
0,57,41,0,57,44,The gods have a dark wit.
0,57,44,0,57,46,It was a grim day.
0,57,47,0,57,50,"- I recall it all too well.
- Yeah..."
0,57,51,0,57,53,It was a good day for you.
0,57,54,0,57,57,"Jaehaerys named you Hand
in Baelon's stead."
0,58,0,0,58,3,"That's hardly how
I viewed it, Your Grace."
0,58,4,0,58,6,It was a duty.
0,58,8,0,58,12,"You served my grandsire
nobly in his final days."
0,58,13,0,58,16,"You are the man that
taught me how to be King."
0,58,18,0,58,22,"- Oh, you honor me, Your Grace.
- (King Viserys sighs)"
0,58,22,0,58,23,Just five days...
0,58,25,0,58,29,"you went from being another man
in Jaehaerys's court,"
0,58,29,0,58,31,"to the second most
powerful man in the realm."
0,58,32,0,58,33,I wonder...
0,58,35,0,58,38,"how long did it take you to choose
yourself over your King?"
0,58,40,0,58,42,Your Grace?
0,58,43,0,58,45,I will never recover from Aemma's death.
0,58,46,0,58,49,But Alicent...
0,58,49,0,58,51,"she took me through
the worst of my grief."
0,58,53,0,58,55,She was a calculated distraction.
0,58,57,0,59,0,"I only now realize
how well-calculated it was."
0,59,0,0,59,3,That is an absurdity.
0,59,3,0,59,5,The Queen loves you...
0,59,6,0,59,8,as I know you love her.
0,59,8,0,59,11,"Your interests no longer align
with those of the realm."
0,59,11,0,59,14,Your judgment has been compromised.
0,59,14,0,59,17,A loyal Hand must tell his king
0,59,17,0,59,20,"a discomforting truth
from time to time, Your Grace."
0,59,20,0,59,22,If he doesn't...
0,59,23,0,59,25,he's failed as a servant.
0,59,26,0,59,28,"You were a faithful servant, Otto."
0,59,38,0,59,40,The crown and the realm
0,59,40,0,59,43,"both owe you a debt
that can never be repaid."
0,59,44,0,59,47,But I can no longer trust your judgment.

1,0,8,1,0,10,(knocks on door)
1,0,11,1,0,12,Come.
1,0,17,1,0,20,"I hope you can forgive
the late hour, Princess."
1,0,25,1,0,28,I took great care in its preparation.
1,0,31,1,0,34,"If not brewed properly,
it can either prove ineffective"
1,0,34,1,0,36,or else bear
1,0,36,1,0,38,"- unpleasant...
- Brewed properly?"
1,0,40,1,0,41,"I'm sorry, what is that?"
1,0,42,1,0,44,"A tea, Princess."
1,0,45,1,0,47,From the King.

unwanted consequences."
