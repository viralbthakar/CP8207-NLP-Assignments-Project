Biography
Background
Meleys is ridden by Rhaenys Targaryen.[1] She has scarlet scales and a crown of bright copper horns. During her youth, she is said to have been faster than both Caraxes and Vhagar.[2]
House of the Dragon: Season 1
Rhaenys rides Meleys towards King's Landing. Her son Laenor Velaryon, who is to marry Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen, rides the dragon Seasmoke at her side.[3]
Meleys stays at High Tide along with several other dragons during the funeral of Laena Velaryon.[4]
Meleys is chained in the Dragonpit during the coronation of Aegon II Targaryen. She is eventually freed by Rhaenys and rides her out of the Dragonpit, inadvertently killing a number of smallfolk during their escape to Dragonstone.[5]
After the coronation of Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen, Rhaenys and Meleys start to patrol the Gullet and reinforce Lord Corlys Velaryon's blockade of the shipping lanes to King's Landing.[6]
In the books
In the prequel novellas, Meleys was known as "the Red Queen", which seems to indicate that she was the mother of several of the other dragons (much as Rhaenys was grandmother to the youngest generation of dragon-riders). Her exact age and lineage has not yet been established.
Meleys does appear to have been one of the oldest and largest dragons after Vhagar herself, and was probably one of the second generation dragons hatched to the original three from the Conquest-generation (Balerion, Meraxes, and Vhagar). Vhagar was 181 years old during the Dance, and by that point as said to have grown as large as Balerion had been during the War of Conquest. Vhagar is also described as being five times the size of the young dragon Arrax, who was only a decade or so old and only just big enough to ride to war.
