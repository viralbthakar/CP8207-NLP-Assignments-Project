Synopsis
Prologue: 11 years ago, at Harrenhal
In the year 101 AC, the lords of Westeros gather in a Great Council to elect a Prince of Dragonstone to succeed Jaehaerys I Targaryen, following the deaths of the king's sons. Although fourteen claims are brought forward, only two are truly considered; those of Princess Rhaenys Targaryen, Jaehaerys's eldest grandchild, and Prince Viserys Targaryen, his eldest grandson. The Great Council elects Prince Viserys to succeed his grandfather.
In King's Landing
It is now the year 112 AC, nine years into Viserys's reign. High above King's Landing, his only daughter, Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen, flies across the city atop her dragon Syrax, landing her outside the gates of the Dragonpit. As the Dragonkeepers escort Syrax away, Rhaenyra is greeted by her sworn shield, Ser Harrold Westerling of the Kingsguard, and her friend, Lady Alicent Hightower. The two girls exchange comments on Syrax's growth before Rhaenyra invites Alicent to take a ride with her on Syrax, though Alicent politely declines. Ser Harrold and several men-at-arms escort Rhaenyra and Alicent in a covered wagon back to the Red Keep. Rhaenyra then pays a visit, with Alicent in attendance, to her heavily pregnant mother, Queen Aemma Arryn. Rhaenyra is dismissive of the idea of being a mother, but Aemma insists that as royal women, birthing royal children is how they serve the realm.
Within the Red Keep, Viserys hosts a meeting with his Small Council, with Rhaenyra in attendance as a cupbearer (though her father lightly chides her for being late to the meeting). His Master of Ships, Lord Corlys Velaryon, warns that the Free Cities have formed an alliance named the "Triarchy" and are trying to claim the Stepstones for themselves. Should the alliance eradicate the pirates currently inhabiting the Stepstones, Corlys warns, Westerosi ports could be badly affected, but his concerns are dismissed by Viserys and his Hand of the King, Ser Otto Hightower. The Master of Coin, Lord Lyman Beesbury, also complains to Viserys about the ruinous amounts of gold his younger brother, Prince Daemon Targaryen who is absent from his seat at the table, has spent in his new role as commander of the City Watch to properly arm and supply his men, but Viserys will hear no complaints against his brother. The discussion then turns to the upcoming "Heir's Tournament" Viserys has planned for the upcoming birth of his next child. Despite Grand Maester Mellos's insistence that there is no way of determining the sex, Viserys is confident the child will be a boy.
After the Small Council concludes, Rhaenyra and Ser Harrold head to the Great Hall, where they find Prince Daemon sitting on the Iron Throne. Ser Harrold is shocked by the disrespect, but Rhaenyra, used to her uncle's flippancy, is more amused. Rhaenyra and Daemon converse in High Valyrian, with Daemon amused at, in his own words, Viserys throwing a tournament for his benefit, since until Viserys actually has a son, Daemon is his heir by law, before gifting his niece a bejeweled necklace of Valyrian steel. Later that evening, as Rhaenyra and Alicent spend time in the Red Keep's godswood, Rhaenyra concludes that she hopes her unborn sibling is a boy for the sake of her father's happiness, ignoring Alicent's remarks that a son would overshadow her in the line of succession. Elsewhere in the Red Keep, Viserys endures Grand Maester Mellos treating a wound supposedly inflicted by the blades of the Iron Throne on his back that has become infected, before going to see his wife Aemma, taking a bath. Viserys tells her of his confidence their child will be a son, but Aemma insists that boy or girl, it will be their last; after several miscarriages and stillbirths, and one child dead in the cradle (a total of five within ten years), she can't bring herself to mourn another child.
As night falls, Daemon addresses the men of the City Watch, proudly identified by the gold cloaks he has bestowed upon them; Daemon declares that he turned the City Watch from a disorganized rabble into a professional force to be reckoned with, before unleashing the gold cloaks on the criminals of King's Landing, who are rounded up en masse to face summary justice; thieves lose a hand, rapers are castrated, murderers executed on the spot. At a Small Council meeting the following morning, at which Daemon is in attendance, Otto complains that the violence used by Daemon and his men was too excessive. Daemon defends his actions by pointing out that with most of Westeros's nobility coming to his brother's tournament, and the general lawlessness of King's Landing, extreme measures were warranted to ensure the safety of all of Viserys's subjects within the city walls. Corlys Velaryon also speaks in support of Daemon's actions, arguing the criminals of King's Landing should fear the City Watch. The discussion turns into a personal argument when Otto snipes that Daemon could put as much effort into his marriage as his work with the gold cloaks, insinuating Daemon should return to his wife's seat, Runestone, in the Vale of Arryn. Daemon scoffs that his wife, Lady Rhea Royce, is likely happier for his absence, derisively referring to her as his "bronze bitch." When Otto defends Lady Rhea's honor, Daemon sarcastically offers to give her to Otto as a replacement for his own late wife. Otto furiously rises to his feet at the insult, but Viserys defuses the argument, admonishing Daemon to police the city without a repeat of the previous night's brutality. Later that night, Daemon complains to his mistress Mysaria, a brothel proprietor, about the lack of respect for his efforts shown by his brother and the Small Council. Mysaria reassures Daemon that, given his reputation and the power and prestige he possesses, the king can not so easily replace him.
The following day, Viserys commences the Heir's Tournament with an announcement that Queen Aemma has gone into labor. Prince Daemon Targaryen quickly becomes a favorite contender in the lists, further insulting Otto by picking as his first opponent his eldest son Ser Gwayne Hightower, defeating Gwayne in the joust by taking out the legs of Gwayne's horse, and then receiving his daughter Alicent's favor. Rhaenyra and Alicent are also intrigued by a new contender, Ser Criston Cole, after his unexpected victories against Lord Boremund Baratheon and his son, Ser Borros. As the tourney continues, a maester arrives and summons Viserys and Otto away. To Viserys's horror, Grand Maester Mellos explains that Queen Aemma's child is in breech, and that they must either cut open her womb to free the baby, a procedure that will almost certainly kill her, or risk losing both mother and child. Despite being appalled by the necessity of such a choice, Viserys grudgingly gives his consent, the Grand Maester's acolytes holding down a delirious and screaming Aemma while Mellos cuts into her womb.
On the tourney grounds, Criston Cole manages to unhorse Daemon in the joust; furious at his unexpected defeat, Daemon angrily demands his sword to continue the fight on foot. Criston dismounts to oblige the prince, wielding a flail while Daemon fights with Dark Sister, one of the two ancestral Valyrian steel swords of House Targaryen. A savage duel ensues from which, to the shock of all spectators, Criston emerges victorious. As a beaten and humiliated Daemon angrily storms off, Criston approaches the royal box and begs Rhaenyra for her favor. Rhaenyra tosses down a floral wreath to him and bids Criston good luck in the rest of the tournament.
In the Red Keep, at his wife's bedside, Viserys weeps over Aemma's body, his wife having bled to death from the procedure to save their child. Grand Maester Mellos informs Viserys that the child in question is a boy and hesitantly asks the king if he and the queen had chosen a name. Viserys answers "Baelon" (in honor of his own father), but at that moment, the infant prince begins choking in the Grand Maester's arms.
Several days later finds the royal court gathered outside the city walls of King's Landing for Queen Aemma and Prince Baelon's funeral. Viserys is near catatonic with grief, while Rhaenyra bitterly ponders to her uncle whether her father finally found happiness in the few short hours her brother lived. Daemon, sympathetic to his brother and niece's losses, urges Rhaenyra to support her father, insisting Viserys will need her more than ever, before Rhaenyra, with a command of "Dracarys" to Syrax, sets her mother and brother's funeral pyre ablaze.
The next day in the Small Council chamber, Otto presses Viserys to set his succession firmly in order. With Prince Baelon's death, Daemon is once again Viserys's heir presumptive, but Otto is adamant that Daemon cannot succeed to the Iron Throne, insisting Daemon would be a second Maegor the Cruel, unaware that Daemon is listening to the entire conversation from the shadows. Viserys angrily dismisses Otto and Mellos's insinuations that Daemon would be willing to murder him to seize the crown, insisting his brother has no ambitions for the Iron Throne because kingship wouldn't suit him, and retorts to Otto's complaints that Daemon's command of the City Watch effectively gives the prince a private army loyal to him within the city walls by pointing out it was Otto's idea to give Daemon the command, given how vigorously Otto complained when Viserys named his brother Master of Laws and Master of Coin. Otto concedes the point, but asserts that in his opinion Daemon should be kept far from power. Corlys Velaryon asks who else would have a claim, to which Otto suggests Rhaenyra. Lord Lyonel Strong, the Master of Laws, vehemently protests this, arguing that Westeros has never had a queen and doing so would overturn centuries of tradition. Viserys refuses the notion of choosing between his daughter and his brother, so Corlys offers an alternative, namely his own wife Rhaenys; as the daughter of King Jaehaerys's eldest son Aemon, she has a valid claim to the throne, and a male heir (Laenor) to continue her line. Otto and Lyonel shout him down before a furious Viserys berates his Small Council for behaving like crows squabbling over a corpse while he is still mourning his wife and son and storms out.
Within the Tower of the Hand, Alicent pays her father a visit as Otto dispatches Mellos with a message to be sent by raven to Oldtown. Otto embraces his daughter, asking after Rhaenyra, before suggesting Alicent might offer her condolences to the princess's father as well. Though apprehensive about the request, Alicent complies, visiting Viserys in his chambers, offering him a history book to distract himself, given his love of the subject, and offers her condolences at Queen Aemma's passing, for which Viserys thanks her. Later that evening, at a pleasure house on the Street of Silk, Daemon hosts a drunken orgy for several of his subordinates in the gold cloaks. Daemon raises a toast to his late nephew. Otto reports this event to Viserys, insisting that his sources claim Daemon dubbed Baelon "the Heir for a Day." While the context is ambiguous, Viserys takes it for an insult and summons his brother.
Viserys confronts Daemon in the Great Hall, seated upon the Iron Throne, the Targaryen sword Blackfyre in his hand, surrounded by his Kingsguard. Viserys angrily demands the truth, if Daemon truly mocked his nephew as the "Heir for a Day." When Daemon calls it his own way of showing grief, Viserys erupts at Daemon for celebrating his restored status with his lickspittles instead of consoling his brother and niece, and for throwing everything Viserys has given him back in the king's face. Daemon retorts that Viserys has only ever tried sending Daemon away from his side, as well as never naming him Hand of the King after ten years of rule. When Viserys scoffs at the notion, Daemon insists he deserves it as Viserys's brother, and that he would do a better job of it than Otto Hightower, who he describes as an overambitious second son out for himself. As Viserys defends his Hand, Daemon asserts that Otto doesn't protect his brother, whereas he would. When Viserys asks from what, Daemon bluntly replies "Yourself. You're weak, Viserys, and that council of leeches knows it. They all prey on you for their own ends."
Outraged by the insult, Viserys declares his intention to name a new heir. When Daemon insists he is his brother's heir, Viserys retorts "Not anymore" and orders Daemon to return to his wife's seat in the Vale. When Daemon steps forward to protest, the Kingsguard draw their swords and block his path, and Daemon grudgingly withdraws.
Later that evening, Viserys summons Rhaenyra to Balerion's shrine within the bowels of the Red Keep. Rhaenyra is confused by the summons, given her father has barely spoken to her since her mother's funeral, and even more so when he asks her what she sees when she looks at the dragons. Staring at Balerion's skull, Rhaenyra admits that she sees their family; the people say that the Targaryens are closer to gods than to men, but it is only because of their control of the dragons. Viserys warns Rhaenyra that the dragons are a dangerous power, a power that caused the Doom of Valyria and might well destroy their family if they are not careful. Viserys asserts that a Targaryen must always understand that truth if they aspire to be king or queen.
As his words sink in for Rhaenyra, Viserys apologizes for spending years chasing a son when he already had a worthy heir in his daughter. He insists that she has the makings of a great queen. To cement his trust in her, Viserys tells Rhaenyra a truth known only to their family: Aegon the Conqueror was not solely motivated by ambition and lust for power to conquer Westeros. Like Daenys Targaryen foresaw the Doom of Valyria, Aegon had a vision that foretold the end of the world of Men. Aegon foresaw the end would be preceded by a terrible winter descending from the North, and that what lurked within that storm would destroy the world of the living, unless the kingdoms of men united against it with a Targaryen to lead them. Since Aegon's time, a Targaryen king has passed knowledge of Aegon's vision, which he dubbed "The Song of Ice and Fire" to their heir, to ensure Westeros was ready when the evil Aegon foresaw finally descended upon mankind.
Before a gathering of the realm's nobility, including houses Velaryon, Hightower, Stark, and Baratheon, Viserys bears witness as the nobles declare oaths of fealty to him and to Rhaenyra as his named heir. At the Dragonpit, Daemon, absent from the ceremony, presents Mysaria to his own dragon Caraxes, before they both take flight on Caraxes's back.

Quotes
Rhaenyra Targaryen: (opening narration) As the first century of the Targaryen dynasty came to a close, the health of the Old King, Jaehaerys, was failing. In those days, House Targaryen stood at the height of its strength, with ten adult dragons under its yoke. No power in the world could stand against it. King Jaehaerys reigned over nearly sixty years of peace and prosperity, but tragedy had claimed both his sons, leaving his succession in doubt. So, in the year 101, the Old King called a Great Council to choose an heir. Over a thousand lords made the journey to Harrenhal. Fourteen succession claims were heard, but only two were truly considered. Princess Rhaenys Targaryen, the king's eldest descendant, and her younger cousin, Prince Viserys Targaryen, the king's eldest male descendant.
High Septon: (in flashback) It is declared by all lords paramount and lords vassal of the Seven Kingdoms that Prince Viserys Targaryen be made Prince of Dragonstone.
Rhaenyra: (narrating) Rhaenys, a woman, would not inherit the Iron Throne. The lords instead chose Viserys, my father. Jaehaerys called the Great Council to prevent a war being fought over his succession, for he knew the cold truth. The only thing that could tear down the House of the Dragon was itself.
Harrold Westerling: Welcome back, princess. I trust your ride was pleasant.
Rhaenyra Targaryen: You need not look so relieved, ser.
Harrold: I am relieved. Every time that golden beast brings you back unspoiled, it saves my head from a spike.
Daemon Targaryen: When I took command of the Watch, you were stray mongrels, starving and undisciplined. Now, you're a pack of hounds. You're sated and honed for the hunt. My brother's city has fallen into squalor. Crime of every breed has been allowed to thrive. No longer. Beginning tonight, King's Landing will learn to fear the color gold.
Otto Hightower: The gods have yet to make a man who lacks the patience for absolute power, Your Grace.
Corlys Velaryon: Who else would have a claim?
Otto Hightower: The king's firstborn child.
Lyonel Strong: Rhaenyra? A girl? No queen has ever sat the Iron Throne.
Grand Maester Mellos: That is only by tradition and precedent, Lord Strong-
Lyonel Strong: If order and stability so concern this council, perhaps we should not overturn one hundred years of it by naming a girl heir.
Viserys I Targaryen: I will not be made to choose between my brother and my daughter.
Corlys Velaryon: You wouldn't have to, Your Grace. There are others who would have a claim.
Lyonel Strong: Such as your wife, Lord Corlys? "The Queen Who Never Was"?
Corlys Velaryon: Rhaenys was the only child of Jaehaerys's eldest son. She had a strong claim at the Great Council and she already has a male heir.
Otto Hightower: Just moments ago, you announced your support for Daemon!
Lyonel Strong: If we cannot agree on an heir, then how can we expect the realm to…?
Viserys I Targaryen: My wife and son are dead! I will not sit here and suffer crows that come to feast on their corpses!
Viserys I Targaryen: "The Heir for a Day". Did you say it?
Daemon Targaryen: We must all mourn in our own way, Your Grace.
Viserys I Targaryen: My family has just been destroyed, but instead of being by my side or Rhaenyra's, you chose to celebrate your own rise! Laughing with your whores and your lickspittles! You have no allies at court but me! I have only ever defended you, yet everything I've given you, you've thrown back in my face!
Daemon Targaryen: You've only ever tried to send me away! To the Vale, to the City Watch, anywhere but by your side. Ten years you've been king and yet not once have you asked me to be your Hand!
Viserys I Targaryen: And why would I do that?
Daemon Targaryen: Because I'm your brother, and the blood of the dragon runs thick.
Viserys I Targaryen: Then why do you cut me so deeply?
Daemon Targaryen: I've only ever spoken the truth. I see Otto Hightower for what he is.
Viserys I Targaryen: An unwavering and loyal Hand?
Daemon Targaryen: A cunt. A second son who stands to inherit nothing he does not seize for himself.
Viserys I Targaryen: Otto Hightower is a more honorable man than you could ever be.
Daemon Targaryen: He doesn't protect you, I would!
Viserys I Targaryen: From what?
Daemon Targaryen: Yourself. You're weak, Viserys, and that council of leeches knows it.
Viserys I Targaryen: I am sorry, Rhaenyra. I have wasted the years since you were born wanting for a son. You are the very best of your mother, and I now believe, as I know she did, that you could be a great ruling queen.
Rhaenyra Targaryen: Daemon is your heir…
Viserys I Targaryen: Daemon was not made to wear the crown, but I believe that you are. This is no trivial gesture, Rhaenyra. A dragon's saddle is one thing, but the Iron Throne is the most dangerous seat in the realm.
Viserys I Targaryen: (talking with Rhaenyra) There's something else that I need to tell you. It might be difficult for you to understand but you must hear it. Our histories... they tell us that Aegon looked across the Blackwater from Dragonstone and saw a rich land ripe for the capture. But ambition alone is not what drove him to conquest. It was a dream. And just as Daenys foresaw the end of Valyria, Aegon foresaw the end of the world of men. 'Tis to begin with a terrible winter gusting out of the distant north. Aegon saw absolute darkness riding on those winds, and whatever dwells within will destroy the world of the living. When this great winter comes, Rhaenyra, all of Westeros must stand against it, and if the world of men is to survive, a Targaryen must be seated on the Iron Throne, a king or queen strong enough to unite the realm against the cold and the dark. Aegon called his dream "The Song of Ice and Fire." This secret, it's been passed from king to heir since Aegon's time. Now you must promise to carry it and protect it. Promise me this, Rhaenyra. Promise me.
Behind the scenes
General
- The camerawork and cinematography in House of the Dragon are notably distinct from its predecessor Game of Thrones, even though this episode was directed by Miguel Sapochnik himself, a veteran director from the prior series. As he explained in an interview with Den of Geek, a key difference is that this story simply doesn't cover as many vastly different physical locations across different continents - so they no longer use color filters to distinguish them. On Game of Thrones, blue color filters were used at the Wall to give an impression that it's colder and at a higher altitude with less light, while King's Landing scenes used an orange color filter to give the impression it is a warmer climate, etc. Given that so much of House of the Dragon: Season 1 is set at King's Landing (and nearby Dragonstone and Driftmark), showrunners Sapochnik and Ryan Condal decided to drop the use of color filters, to let the natural colors "pop" on-screen, highlighting that this is the Targaryen golden age and full of bright, opulent heraldry.[1]
- The title of the episode derives from the chapter of Fire & Blood it is adapted from, "Heirs of the Dragon — A Question of Succession."
- Viserys is referred to by the full title, "King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men". Game of Thrones usually omitted mention of "the Rhoynar" because Dorne wasn't introduced until Season 4 and the writers were unsure if they would ever appear.
- Viserys refers to bells tolling in the "Grand Sept" - but not the "Great Sept". The Great Sept of Baelor won't be built for another half-century. The Great Sept replaced an earlier one atop Visenya's Hill.
- Another way the skyline of King's Landing is different is that the Dragonpit atop Rhaenys's Hill is not yet in ruins, but a mega-structure on the scale of the Red Keep, used as a massive stable for the dragons.
- Other than the cold open prologue at Harrenhal, this entire episode is set at King's Landing.
- When Daemon is introduced sitting on the Iron Throne, Harrold Westerling is shocked and Rhaenyra says he can't be heir if he's executed for treason. Only the king is allowed to sit on the Iron Throne - or if he is indisposed, the Hand of the King - and for anyone else including the designated heir to sit on it is officially treason (and Daemon isn't even the official heir at the time, only the presumed heir). Daemon's flippancy towards this rule immediately displays in his first scene how much of a rogue he is.
- The scene near the end of the end of the episode where Daemon remarks on the "heir for a day" in a brothel is the first of several "unreliable narrator" moments in Fire & Blood, due to the framing device that it is an in-universe history book with conflicting sources. Some sources say that Daemon's remark was repeated by the whore who was on his lap, while other "more plausible" ones say one of the Gold Cloaks eager for a promotion repeated it. The TV episode avoids directly showing how Otto found out about it, though it presents that Daemon was actually morose after the death of his brother's wife and son, not entertaining a whore on his lap. It then cuts away before showing what he said, or more importantly, how he said it: flippant and celebrating, or depressed and bitterly sarcastic.
- The scene of Rhaenyra and Alicent in the castle godswood prominently discusses a book about Nymeria, warrior-princess of the Rhoynar and founder of unified Dorne. Perhaps not coincidentally, at the time this was made HBO was actively considering a pitch for an additional prequel spinoff about the story of Nymeria, by writer Amanda Segel. By the time this episode aired, the Nymeria project advanced from the pitch phase and HBO ordered a full pilot episode script to be written, under the working title Ten Thousand Ships. Filming hasn't been greenlit yet, however, as HBO is waiting to see how well House of the Dragon performs.
- Viserys's words "I will not sit here and suffer crows that come to feast on their corpses!" are perhaps a reference to the fourth novel, A Feast for Crows.
- The scene near the end of the episode in which Viserys summons Rhaenyra to meet in front of Balerion's skull was the first scene that Milly Alcock filmed.[2]
- Costume designer Jany Temime gave several details about the extravagant "Investiture" outfit that Rhaenyra wears in the final scene of the episode. Temime described the overall design as "inspired by Byzantine elements", and explained that it looks so different from the other designs at court because it is not a contemporary design: the idea is that this is a ceremonial robe that "has been passed down for four or five generations", worn by each new Prince of Dragonstone when they were formally invested as heir to the throne. Thus the robe apparently goes back to the time of Aegon the Conqueror himself, used for his son and all subsequent kings for the next four generations (Aegon to his grandson Jaehaerys, and from Jaehaerys to his grandson Viserys). The heirloom investiture robe therefore offers a glimpse of earlier art styles from the Conquest generation, which are hinted to be more Byzantine-inspired. It took a team of three people ten weeks to embroider the entire outfit.[3] The "accessories", however, particularly the large earrings, were inspired by Moroccan wedding dresses.[4]
- During the early development of the series, George R.R. Martin suggested a first episode titled "The Heir and the Spare," centering on the relationship between Aemon and Baelon Targaryen, and leading up to their deaths. By Martin's account, he was the only one enthused by this idea.[5]
Filming locations
The home base for production has shifted from Titantic Studios in Belfast (on Game of Thrones) to the massive WB Leavesden Studios complex outside of London, England.
Exterior filming locations for this season included parts of England, Spain, and Portugal. In this episode:
- The first scene of Rhaenyra landing at the Dragonpit actually wasn't filmed in the Leavesden Studios backlot, but was instead filmed in a quarry located in the Peak District of northern England.
- Many of the King's Landing street scenes were filmed in Cáceres, Spain, which was previously used for King's Landing locations starting in Game of Thrones: Season 7.
- The funeral pyre scene for Rhaenyra's mother Queen Aemma, at a seaside cliff outside the city, was filmed in Devon, England. According to Ryan Condal, it was one of the most difficult exterior locations they filmed at in Season 1 due to its extreme remoteness, and they weren't allowed to use any real fire for the funeral pyre because it was a protected site.[3]
The new Red Keep set
- Because so many scenes are set in the Red Keep, all of the interior sets were combined into one large interconnected set: at various points the camerawork highlights this by following characters in uninterrupted cuts as they walk between rooms.[6]
- The new Red Keep set is 62 meters long, 39 meters wide, and 13.5 meters height at its tallest point. This includes multiple levels and functional staircases. The interiors have a combined area of 35,000 square feet. The entire combined set took four months to build.[3]
- The entire Red Keep is filled with erotic Valyrian tapestries, which according to the showrunners it meant to highlight that the series begins in an age of decadence and opulence, when the Targaryens are at their height and do not fear judgement by anyone (including the leadership of the Faith of the Seven).[3]
- The Iron Throne itself has been significantly expanded. As showrunner Ryan Condal explained, the Iron Throne in the books is 40 feet tall and requires a small stair to reach the seat - due to limits of budget and space the Iron Throne developed for the first season of Game of Thrones was a large chair made of melted swords (George R.R. Martin liked the design and considers it iconic, but always noted it wasn't what it's like in his books). Condal tried to meet this halfway: making it closer to Martin's vision while still honoring the original design. The result was that the "Iron Throne" is now a pile of melted swords that expands out and down the raised steps at the end of the hall, with the original Iron Throne from Game of Thrones at the center. Condal said the implication is that as the Targaryen dynasty declined over the centuries these extra parts were eventually removed, making it look like it did in the original TV series.[3]
- The decoration of the Iron Throne room in general is different from Game of Thrones, though the original series already established that different rulers sometimes redecorate it: when Joffrey took over after Robert Baratheon died, he replaced the metal vine decorations on the columns with spikes and roaring fires. In this era, the columns of the throne room are decorated with large statues of prior Targaryen kings: there are specifically four columns with statues, of the first four kings that came before Viserys I, and the remaining columns stretching back through the hall have empty space for future generations of kings. Each column is also decorated with relief sculptures wrapping around them, like Trajan's Column, depicting historical scenes.[3]
- A new room is used for Small Council meetings: it is much wider and with larger windows. Miguel Sapochnik explained he ordered this so there is more room to position the camera anywhere they want, instead of being limited to a few angles, and to let more light in for the shots.[3]
- In Game of Thrones, the preserved skull of Balerion the dragon was packed away to a dungeon level and forgotten, after the fall of the Targaryen dynasty. In House of the Dragon, the Targaryens are at the height of their power and venerate their dragons, so the producers came up with the idea that Balerion's skull would be preserved in its own dedicated shrine (after all the dragons died, later Targaryen kings through Daenerys's father would display their skulls lined up in the throne room). The prop of Balerion's skull in this series is not simply a re-use of the prop seen in Game of Thrones - apart from its different shape, this time it is notably black and not white, as the books explain dragonbone is disproportionately strong due to its high iron content. The new Balerion prop skull is nine meters long, and took seven weeks to make. [3]
- Rhaenyra and Alicent have scenes in the Red Keep's godswood, which has a Weirwood heart tree. The castle did have a godswood in the books, Game of Thrones simply didn't have the extra budget to show it on-screen in the early seasons. Notably, the heart tree in the books is actually an oak, not a weirwood: apparently because King's Landing is a relatively new city, there simply wasn't a pre-existing weirwood there. In contrast, other castles have godswoods built around a pre-existing heart tree left by the Children of the Forest.
The Great Council at Harrenhal
- According to adult Rhaenyra's voiceover, "tragedy had claimed both his [Jaehaerys's] sons", without mentioning their names. His elder son Prince Aemon Targaryen was killed by a crossbow bolt to the throat in a skirmish with Myrish pirates nine years earlier, then in 101 AC his younger brother Baelon Targaryen died of appendicitis.
- The scroll that Jaehaerys opens giving the final result identifies that Viserys's parents were Jaehaerys's son Baelon, and Baelon's sister-wife Alyssa. Later in the episode Viserys says in dialogue that he will name his newborn son "Baelon", but doesn't specify that he's naming him after his own father.
- The phrasing about "both" of his sons may have caused some confusion about whether Jaehaerys's other sons were cut from TV-canon, but the Official Guide confirms that Jaehaerys had 13 children. Of these, only three sons survived the cradle - but the third son Vaegon became an archmaester and could not inherit (in addition to the fact that both of his older brothers had surviving children with stronger claims).
- The details of the Great Council at Harrenhal have been somewhat condensed in the TV version. In the book, the final two candidates were Viserys and Rhaenys's son Laenor, not Rhaenys herself, who was counted as one of the other potential candidates (14 in total). It was still, broadly speaking, seen as a vote between the bloodlines of Viserys and Rhaenys. The TV series also says that there were 14 candidates but it's unclear if Laenor and Laena are included in that count as they were in the book - though only 11 out of 14 candidates were ever described in the book, so there is no complete list to disrupt.
- Jaehaerys was not physically present at Harrenhal during the long deliberations (either because he was too older to travel or thought it inappropriate), though he plausibly could have come for the final tally.
- Rhaenyra's voiceover lists off that by the time of the Great Council the Targaryens possessed 10 adult dragons. This presumably included Vermithor and Silverwing (belonging to Jaehaerys and his sister-wife), Caraxes (ridden by Jaehaerys's first son), Vhagar (ridden by Baelon), Meleys (ridden by Alyssa), Dreamfyre (the mount of Jaehaerys's dead older sister), Syrax (bonded to Rhaenyra), and Seasmoke (bonded to Laenor by that point in the book, though he had yet to ride him). This count only yields 8, but two older dragons known to have been alive at this point were living "wild" on Dragonstone, unclaimed by any rider. Other dragons would hatch and be claimed during the reign of Viserys I.
- The entire, brief council scene was filmed entirely on greenscreen - rather than build a massive Harrenhal set which they'd barely use in Season 1. It was actually filmed in the Iron Throne room set, because it was the biggest internal set they had. Halfway through construction, before any of the surfaces were finished, they painted the wood walls green and hung green screens from the ceiling - the only parts actually constructed were Jaehaerys's throne and the steps leading up to it. While some of Harrenhal's vast ruin were seen in Game of Thrones, for this section of the castle the design drew inspiration from various ancient cathedrals such as Whitby Abbey.[3]
The Small Council
- Viserys's Small Council in this episode consists of Otto Hightower (Hand of the King), Ser Ryam Redwyne (Lord Commander of the Kingsguard), Grand Maester Mellos, Corlys Velaryon (Master of Ships), Lyman Beesbury (Master of Coin), and Lyonel Strong (Master of Laws). The seventh position, Master of Whisperers (spymaster), is not present: in the books the identity of Viserys's spymaster in the first half of his reign, or whether he even had one during that time, was not stated.
- The Small Council has been somewhat condensed from the book, in which Corlys Velaryon resigned his position as Master of Ships in protest after his wife (and children) were passed over for the throne in the Great Council at Harrenhal. The conversations TV-Corlys has in council scenes were conveyed through written correspondence and messengers in the book, complaining to the king about the Triarchy's affect on shipping lanes in the Stepstones. The TV series shifted this into face-to-face conversations. This doesn't displace any character, as it is unknown who Viserys's Master of Ships was during the first half of his reign.
- Corlys Velaryon introduces that the recent alliance in the Free Cities is calling itself "the Triarchy." It is a triple-alliance between Lys, Myr, and Tyrosh. The name is noted to be a misnomer in-universe, as it isn't ruled by "triarchs" the way Volantis is, but is rather - as TV-Corlys says - more of an "alliance."
- Grand Maester Mellos in the TV series is a condensation of two Grand Maesters from the book: the one during the first half of Viserys's reign was a man named Runciter, who was replaced by Mellos for most of the second half of Viserys's reign. In terms of personality he matches book-Mellos, particularly his go-to suggestion for leechings (other maesters in the narrative argue that various chemical tinctures would be more effective).
- Otto notes that Daemon has a seat at the Small Council as commander of the City Watch. Technically this isn't one of the formal seven offices on the council (like Hand of the King or Master of Ships), but it has long been tradition that the commander of the City Watch indeed has a seat at the council table as an advisor.
- As Viserys points out to Otto near the end of the episode, in the book, he tried giving Daemon a royal office just to keep him occupied and out of trouble, resulting in brief stints in which Daemon served as Master of Laws and then Master of Coin, both of which he hated, so he was made commander of the City Watch.
- Daemon created the modern City Watch in the book, and gave them their eponymous gold cloaks as a standard uniform. His brutal crackdown on crime in the city played out over several months in the book: it is condensed into one major raid in the TV episode, but is still quite accurate to the book (which noted that Daemon enthusiastically cut the hands off thieves and castrated rapers).
- Daemon refers to his wife Rhea Royce as "my bronze bitch", and quips that in the Vale, the men have sex with sheep because they're prettier than their women - all of these remarks are quotes from the book. Daemon calls Rhea "my bronze bitch" because House Royce are famous for their ancestral bronze armor.
- As the meeting ends, Viserys remarks that maybe the strict order imposed by the new City Watch is a good thing for now, because the city has been falling into chaos ever since his grandmother died. In the books, Queen Alysanne Targaryen died two years before the Great Council at Harrenhal, and her death left Jaehaerys a shell of the man he once was. Compounded by the sudden death of his son (and Viserys's father) Baelon, Jaehaerys lived out the remaining two years of his reign feeble and bedridden. Thus since Alysanne's death, royal administration in the city has fallen into a state of disrepair.
- The little detail of the Small Council placing smooth stones, called "totems" in the Official Guide, on the table when a meeting is in session has no basis in the book. Viserys's specific totem is made of a material called "septarian" or "dragon stone." The totems are left on the big plate in the center of the table, and each council member moves them to the smaller plate in front of their seats when the council is in session. In an interview with THR, set decorator Claire Nie Richards explained that she and production designer Jim Clay came up with this idea: "It represented the council coming in and being part of the meeting." Ryan Condal added: "Everybody shows up for work and they 'punch in'. I thought it was really cool. It's a way of visualizing the set formality of the Small Council chamber. It's enjoyable; we should have things that we like in this world."[7] Notice that at the first Small Council meeting one stone is left on the central plate because Daemon isn't there, then once the second meeting begins there are no remaining stones. The lack of an extra stone or chair further implies that Viserys simply hasn't named a Master of Whisperers at this point.
House Hightower
Not much information was given about the House Hightower family tree in the book, thus the TV series has expanded on several points:
- No mention is ever made about Alicent's mother, neither her name nor birth family, nor even if she is alive or dead. The fact that she never appears in the narrative does imply that she is dead. The TV version confirmed this, having Alicent sympathize when Rhaenyra loses her own mother.
- Otto's older brother, the current Lord Hightower at the beginning of Viserys's reign, is unnamed in the book. The TV series assigned him the name "Hobert Hightower," which is the name of a minor Hightower cousin from the story.
- Gwayne Hightower is said to be the "youngest" of Alicent's brothers in the book. However, no further information is given about his birth order, nor any information about the other brothers ("youngest brother" can both mean he's older or younger than Alicent.) The TV series condensed this to make Gwayne the "eldest" of Alicent's brothers, which still implies that there is more than one.
The Heir's Tournament
- The Heir's Tournament scene condenses together several different tournament scenes that happened in the book. It's mostly based on the tourney held to celebrate Viserys I's ascension to the throne, held in 104 AC (a year after he became king but a year before Aemma died in the book). Criston Cole defeated all challengers, even unhorsing Daemon and defeating him in single combat, and thus earning himself a place on the Kingsguard as soon as a new spot opened up. The tourney was not timed to occur exactly when Viserys's son Baelon was born (the following year). Seven years later, at the infamous "blacks and greens" tournament, Criston Cole also unhorsed Gwayne Hightower. Here, Gwayne is unhorsed by Daemon, using a dirty move by intentionally striking at his horse.
- Lead horse wrangler Camilla Naprous from Game of Thrones returned to work on House of the Dragon. She explained that her team used over 30 horses for this tournament sequence.[3]
- The tournament stadium in King's Landing mostly exists as CGI extensions: the finished on-screen version is designed to fit 1,000 people, though only about 150 extras were actually present on-set, spaced out due to COVID filming restrictions. They were then digitally re-copied to populate the entire CGI stadium.[3]
- The armor that the knights wear in the tournament was designed to be intentionally extravagant and impractical, to highlight how much this is an age of "decadence and opulence" with no major war in living memory. For example, the dragon wings on Daemon's helmet or the tower turret on Gwayne Hightower's head would blatantly catch sword blows, when functional armor is meant to deflect incoming blows. Sapochnik: "We often talked about this idea that at the jousting tournament, they'd be wearing such crazy armor that literally didn't work because it didn't protect them, because it really wasn't about that anymore."[8] Costume designer Jany Temime said that she drew inspiration from a variety of places for the designs: there are "elements of oriental armor, Persian armor, Greek armor."[3]
- Daemon Targaryen's tournament armor was the most sophisticated design: it took 16 weeks to get the shape, 8 to 10 weeks for manufacture, and was made by a team of 10 to 12 people. The dragon helmet went through seven or eight incarnations before the final one. There were even more dragons on it in the earlier versions. A key feature Temime wanted to keep through each iteration was that the ruby eyes of the dragon atop the helmet were always pointed forwards, as if directly staring at whoever Daemon was facing.[3]
- The weapon that Criston Cole wields is consistently referred to as a "morningstar" in the books, though this is inaccurate. In real life, a solid spiked club is called a "morningstar", while an iron ball attached to a stick by a chain is called a "flail" - regardless of whether the ball at the end of the chain is spiked. In Westeros, however, this is officially called a "morningstar," because that is what Martin consistently calls them.
- When Daemon selects his jousting opponent, the line of riders (from left to right) bear the heraldry of House Bolton, House Tyrell, House Mallister, House Corbray, House Hightower (Gwayne, who Daemon picks), House Lefford, House Cole (Criston), House Stark, House Lannister, House Baratheon, House Tully, House Darklyn, and House Tarly. The central rail on the tourney ground is decorated with truncated versions of this heraldry: some is clearly recognizable, such as a Lannister lion with just the head and not the whole body, while others are only identifiable compared with the full version (a green flame with no tower for House Hightower, a bleeding heart for House Corbray, etc.)
- House Darklyn is actually extinct by the time of Game of Thrones, as after the rebellion known as the Defiance of Duskendale Daenerys's father the Mad King had them all executed.
- The costumes worn by the tourney attendants, musicians, and announcer feature a Targaryen sigil with the colors reversed: a black dragon on a red background. This unintentionally recreates the heraldry of House Blackfyre, a younger branch of House Targaryen that fights a series of civil wars against the main branch. The first Blackfyre Rebellion, however, won't be fought for over 90 years from the events of this episode, so at the current time the reversed color scheme on the sigil has no such meanings associated with it.
- During the tournament, Rhaenyra is constantly playing with the Valyrian steel necklace that Daemon gave her. The books mention that one of Rhaenyra's character tics was that she would play with her jewelry when she was thinking.
- Alicent's character tic of engaging in mild self-harm by biting and picking at her nails, however, is an invention of the TV series.
- As mentioned in dialogue, House Cole is a minor family of hereditary stewards in service to House Dondarrion, on the southern border of the Stormlands with Dorne - a borderland known as the Dornish Marches. Criston himself is not described as looking part-Dornish, however (only that he had "coal black hair and pale green eyes"), though this isn't implausible given that in this contested region the borders have been constantly shifting for centuries.
- At the tournament, Rhaenys Targaryen refers to Borros Baratheon as "cousin" - Rhaenys's mother was Jocelyn Baratheon, sister of Boremund Baratheon (seen later in the swearing scene before the throne), and Borros is Boremund's son, making him Rhaenys's first cousin.
- House Baratheon heraldry at the tournament accurately depicts a stag with a crown around its neck. Game of Thrones: Season 1 included a scene in which Bran Stark remarked that the stag heraldry only gained a crown after Robert Baratheon usurped the throne, but this was erroneous: the first Dunk & Egg prequel novella, released in 1998, established that it was always a crowned stag. This is because it was originally the crowned stag heraldry of the old Storm Kings of House Durrandon. Their founder Orys Baratheon married the daughter of the last Storm King and copied his heraldry.
- At the tournament, Lord Lyman Beesbury wagers five Gold dragons on Daemon. This raises a point: we have no idea what relative money values were like during this prequel era, so any stated in dialogue are an invention of the TV series. The first prequel setting George R.R. Martin wrote about, the Tales of Dunk and Egg, began only about 90 years before the main novels, and it established that currency values in Westeros realistically fluctuate over time, experiencing inflation and deflation. Money values in the Dunk & Egg era were about four times what they were in the main novels (i.e. Jaime and Brienne consider 1 Gold Dragon a good price for a horse, but Dunk sold a horse for almost 4 Gold Dragons in his first novella). In contrast, Fire & Blood simply didn't give any money values for the Dance of the Dragons era. Not only might inflation be at play, but royal coinage could have been revalued between these time periods, adding in a higher or lower ratio of gold. By comparison, in dialogue invented for Game of Thrones: Season 1 that wasn't in the books, during the tournament scene Renly Baratheon wagered Petyr Baelish 100 Gold Dragons on the joust. Like Renly and Littlefinger, Lyman Beesbury is a member of the Small Council, so he is probably capable of making an equivalently large bet, but that doesn't necessarily mean he did: for all we know, 100 Gold Dragons is worth just as much here as it was for Renly, and Beesbury just didn't feel like making a very large bet. More money values will come up as the season progresses.
Aemma Arryn
- Aemma Arryn's death in childbirth is only mentioned in one sentence in Fire & Blood - because it is an in-universe history book: "Queen Aemma was brought to bed in Maegor's Holdfast and died whilst giving birth to the son that Viserys Targaryen had desired for so long." The TV series expanded this to show in graphic detail her death in an emergency caesarean section. In their July 2022 cover story with The Hollywood Reporter,[9] as well as the Inside the Episode video, the showrunners said they wanted to emphasize - realistically, but without being gratuitous - just how dangerous childbirth was with medieval levels of medical technology. Cast and crew elaborated in interviews that Aemma's death in childbirth was meant to be traumatic, because it hangs like a cloud over Viserys and Rhaenyra for the rest of their lives. Viserys is haunted by guilt, while Rhaenyra blames him for essentially "murdering" her mother, and the impression this makes on her of what the defined role for women in their medieval society is supposed to be, it and drives her not to accept these constraints.
- Emma D'Arcy (adult Rhaenyra) said: "For Rhaenyra, that traumatic event is also something that defines a journey about what type of woman she wants to be. She perceives what happens to her mother to be a form of abuse...Her mother loses control. She loses bodily autonomy. And I think Rhaenyra is sure as hell not [going] to let that happen to her."''[10]
- Aemma Arryn's actress Sian Brooke said: "It's quite hard to think now, as a woman, to put yourself in [Aemma's] position. It's so vulnerable to think, 'That's what you are: a vessel for childbirth.' You've got this battle showing man's eternal quest for power and status. And then within that, you've got this woman who's at the mercy of a man's decision. You think you've made this huge leap forward, with women being able to make decisions about their own bodies. It's quite shocking, that, sadly, there is some similarity between that and centuries ago."[11]
- Sapochnik confirmed that the exact wording of the line to Viserys that "sometimes a father has to make an impossible choice" was specific and intentional, "the idea being that Queen Aemma doesn't get to choose her fate even though she’s right there. King Viserys and the Grand Maester never think to consult her, and so she is powerless over a decision about her own body."[12]
- Director Miguel Sapochnik said in THR: "In medieval times, giving birth was violence. It's as dangerous as it gets. You have a 50/50 chance of making it. We have a number of births in the show and basically decided to give them different themes and explore them from different perspectives the same way I did for a bunch of battles on Thrones." In an interview with Popsugar, Sapochnik elaborated: "We gave themes to the births, and that theme for that birth was 'torture'. Then there's a birth where the theme is 'the agony and the ecstasy'. There's a birth where the theme is 'impasse', and there's a birth where the theme is 'a battle'. So we are trying to look at them in different ways."[13]
- Sapochnik continued in an extensive interview with LA Times: "The hope and intention of the show — beyond the primary one of entertainment — is to shine a light on how the experience of men and women in this world has parallels to our own past and present...I know it may sound extreme, but we wanted it to be difficult to watch. We wanted people to remember that no matter what they thought of Viserys, he did this and he could never take it back. It is the story's inciting incident and needed to be strong and unflinching."[14]
- Sapochnik continued in the LA Times interview to explain their efforts to refine the scene to be both realistic and not gratuitous for the audience:[15]
- Two professional midwives were present on set, "to talk us through the reality of a Caesarean without anesthesia or modern instruments and medicine. We also tried to make sure to represent the effect of the resulting blood loss on the mother so that it was clear what killed her." One of the two real midwives plays one of the midwives on-screen.
- Sapochnik’s goal was "not to shy away from what was happening but also not to sensationalize it". This resulted in a "painstaking" editing process, which began with an "all-in version", after which they began "slowly whittling away...what was too much, or felt gratuitous, or a repeat beat." Once they intercut it with the jousting sequence several shots became redundant so further cuts were made.
- During this editing process, they tweaked the scene's point of views, "shifting away from Viserys's experience of the birth onto Aemma's, until we felt we’d found the right balance that neither glorified nor shied away from the point we were trying to make."
- Finally, the showrunners played the scene for as many women as possible to get their feedback: "We were anxious not to get it wrong. And unanimously, the feedback was positive. Some felt it wasn't violent enough."
- George R.R. Martin himself weighed in on the scene in a post-episode interview with Vanity Fair and said that he thought how it was handled was well-done: "That scene is...you don't want to use the word 'enjoyable' for a scene like that, but it's incredibly powerful. It's visceral and it'll rip your heart out and throw it on the floor. It has the kind of impact that the Red Wedding had. It's a beautifully done scene of something horrible." Martin then responded to accusations that it was "gratuitous" by comparing it to the destruction of Alderaan in Star Wars: "I want to live the book. I want to be there. I want my emotions engaged. Those are the kind of novels I love to read and the kind of things I love to write. That's what affects you emotionally. I've been accused of being a particularly bloody person. Star Wars kills more people than I do...In the first Star Wars movie, here comes the Death Star. They blow up the planet of Alderaan — 20 million people are dead." - [Note: the actual death toll was 2 billion] - "Does it have any impact on you? Do you care that 20 million people are dead? Six movies later, you find out, I guess, that Jimmy Smits was one of them. Then you retroactively go, 'Oh, they've killed Jimmy Smits!' but you don't feel anything at the moment. It's just, 'Oh, okay.' It's a statistic. What would it mean if Viserys was watching the tournament, and a messenger comes running in and says, 'Your wife has died'? Is that going to have any effect on you? I don't think so."[16]
- The staff Intimacy Coordinator Miriam Lucia helped oversee filming of the scene, and said it was filmed on a closed set. About half of the people in the room were women (due to all of the midwives). Fourteen different gowns had to be made for Sian Brooke because all of the fake blood ruined each of them with every take, so they had to start again with a new one each time.[17]
- In the Inside the Episode, Sapochnik said that it was his idea to present Aemma's death in childbirth and the violence in the tournament as an intercut montage, highlighting Aemma's earlier remark that "the childbed is our battlefield", though he later admitted the interview with PopSugar that it was actually his editor Tim Porter's idea: "It seemed like this is an appropriate time to draw that parallel visually between the two, the male and the female struggle. One's fighting on the battlefield, the other's fighting for survival, sometimes from the person closest to her"[18]
- The line that for medieval women "the childbed is our battlefield" is from the books, not given by Aemma but said by Randyll Tarly to Brienne in the fourth novel, using slightly different words: "The gods made men to fight, and women to bear children. A woman's war is in the birthing bed". In that context, however, he was being dismissive, because he felt women shouldn't be warriors - they have battlefield enough in the birthing bed.
- Sapochnik revealed in the Inside the Episode that it was Matt Smith's idea to play Daemon's reaction to Aemma's death as being "the most caring and responsive out of the three," as Viserys is left stunned into silence and Rhaenyra seething with anger that her father's drive to produce a male heir killed her mother. Daemon is the one at her funeral gently urging Rhaenyra that her father needs her now more than ever, and he is genuinely pained to see how shattered his older brother is.
- Sapochnik explained in the Inside the Episode that Viserys named Rhaenyra heir not just out of anger at Daemon's (apparent) flippancy, but also a mix of guilt at Aemma's death and love for Rhaenyra. He feels guilty that Aemma felt pressured to have many dangerous pregnancies which ultimately killed her in pursuit of a male heir, when he could have just named Rhaenyra heir years ago and stopped trying for more children. Meanwhile, he also sees the strength and potential in Rhaenyra, and indeed feels she could be a worthy heir to the throne.
Prophecies
This episode prominently mentions three separate Targaryens having prophetic dreams, which is a well-known family trait in the books. Only one of these specific dreams is from the books, however, while the other two have not appeared:
- Viserys mentions that Daenys Targaryen (known as "Daenys the Dreamer") had a prophetic dream that the Doom of Valyria would come (a massive volcanic eruption that destroyed their homeland). Heeding her dream, her father and the rest of House Targaryen relocated to Dragonstone, at the time the distant westernmost overseas outpost of Valyria. Thus when the Doom came 12 years later, only the Targaryens and their dragons survived.
- Viserys goes on to discuss with his wife Aemma that he himself has had a prophetic dream, "more real than any memory," in which he saw his son being born wearing the iron crown of Aegon the Conqueror. This is why Viserys is so convinced that Aemma will give birth to a (healthy) boy, and it leaves him baffled when both of them die.
- In a major addition, Viserys tells Rhaenyra that the real reason that their ancestor Aegon the Conqueror invaded and united the Seven Kingdoms and forged the Iron Throne is because he also had a prophetic dream. Aegon I dreamed that "the end of men" would come in the form of an apocalyptic winter from the far north, bringing dark forces with it - clearly indicating the eventual return of the White Walkers though not mentioning them by name. Aegon realized that the world of men needed to be united under one banner to stand against this threat, so the Targaryens conquered Westeros to save it. This prophecy was then passed down as a secret only from king to heir. Aegon called his dream "The Song of Ice and Fire," which is the title of the main novels series.
- It is currently unknown if this is an invention of the TV show, or in truth a secret plot detail that George R.R. Martin intended to reveal in the final books. There are some hints that Martin may have been planning it for at least several years - chief among them, Martin's allusions to it in promotional videos for the release of Fire & Blood in 2018.
- The only time the phrase "song of ice and fire" has been mentioned in the novel series is in conjunction with Rhaegar Targaryen - older brother of Daenerys and Jon Snow's secret father. When Daenerys herself has a prophetic dream of Rhaegar, she sees him telling his firstborn son that he is the Prince That Was Promised (to rally the world against the White Walkers) and "his will be the song of ice and fire". Moreover, Barristan Selmy recalls that Rhaegar was more interested in being a scholar than a warrior in his youth - but then one day he just showed up in the training yard, and said he read something in an ancient scroll indicating he needed to be a warrior. Thus it is somewhat implied that Rhaegar rediscovered this lost prophecy by Aegon I and it motivated his actions leading up to Robert's Rebellion and the birth of Jon Snow.
- The "next week's episode" preview at the end of this one shows young Rhaenyra reading the Valyrian glyphs etched onto Viserys's Valyrian steel dagger, only visible after it is heated in flame, and it is in fact a verbatim quote of what Rhaegar said in Daenerys's vision of him: "from my blood come The Prince That Was Promised, and his will be the Song of Ice and Fire".
- The exact chain through which this prophecy was passed down "from king to heir" in the first century of Targaryen rule is unclear. Aegon I apparently told his eldest son and heir, Aenys Targaryen - who was the father of Jaehaerys (seen as an old man at the beginning of the episode). Upon Aenys's death, however, the throne was usurped by his half-brother Maegor the Cruel - and given that he wasn't the formal heir it's unknown if Maegor ever knew about the prophecy. Maegor also killed Jaehaerys's older brother, who had been crown prince, but it's possible that his brother's surviving widow told Jaehaerys. Regardless, Jaehaerys then either told Viserys's father Baelon when he was heir, or simply told Viserys right after the result of the Great Council at Harrenhal named him heir.
In an interview with Den of Geek, Miguel Sapochnik explained that this was also a great way to add back in the magical or spiritual element of the main A Song of Ice and Fire novels to this prequel era, which other than the dragons has very little magic in it:
- "We wanted to keep alive the notion of spirituality that [was in] the original show. There was myth, there was folklore, there were stories, ice spiders as big as hounds, et cetera, et cetera. But we don't have those things, so we needed to find something to hang the hat on of the spirituality, which plays such a large part. Fate and destiny is such a big part of that story."[19]
At a press junket with Insider, Popsugar, Metacritic, and Gizmodo, Ryan Condal stated that the information about Aegon having a prophetic dream of the White Walkers' return came from George R.R. Martin himself. He told Condal during the early writing process, at the meetings where they were figuring out the "architecture" of the series as a whole (i.e. around late 2018, as Condal was hired in September 2018):
- "That was the detail that George actually gave us early in the story break — the idea that Aegon the Conqueror was himself a dreamer and that's what motivated the Conquest - Which he mentioned casually in conversation, as he often does with huge pieces of information like that. - He saw a vision of the White Walkers coming across the wall and sweeping over the land with cold and darkness. And but it never made the history books because [Aegon] never told anyone, or at least the people they told didn’t tell the history to the history writers. So it’s in George’s head."[20][21]
Condal went on to explain a key point: each Targaryen king from Aegon to Viserys thought this apocalyptic event was relatively imminent, not a distant problem 300 to 200 years in the future, and it shaped their actions accordingly:
- "It really changed our thinking of the way we saw the Targaryen reign and what it was all about. The fact that Aegon had this knowledge — or perceived that he had this knowledge, because it is just a dream, you don't know whether it's going to come true — but that he pursued the Conquest thinking that this was an imminent problem...The dramatic irony of this, is that we know with the remove of 300 years, that it takes quite some time for this prophecy to come true...This idea that at some point in Aegon's life as he got older, he must have realized the White Walkers weren't coming for dinner during his lifetime."
- Then we decided that if he believed in this enough to conquer Westeros, he surely would have believed in it enough to pass the idea on. So we had this become the legacy that the Targaryens have and they pass it from king to heir as a reminder that the Iron Throne is a privilege and it's a duty and a responsibility. You have to improve the kingdom and make it stronger and more united and not use it as a pursuit for selfish game. We'll see how that hangs on as our story develops."[22]
Condal also explained why Rhaenyra doesn't just tell all the other lords about the prophecy at some point in her life: they'd have either thought she was crazy, or thought she made it up as an excuse to avoid near-term political problems.[23]
Condal re-iterated that Martin told him about this prophecy in the official post-episode podcast.[24] Condal said the belief that the prophecy was relatively imminent still shaped the actions of the early Targaryen kings, i.e. Jaehaerys built the Kingsroad and the royal highway network as part of the broader goal to forge a strong and unified realm out of seven independent kingdoms (consider that the first royal highway was constructed from King's Landing to the Wall, not to the other major cities like Oldtown and Lannisport). Condal did chuckle, however, that perhaps Maegor the Cruel simply didn't know about the prophecy, as he was a usurper and not the designated heir, so no one ever told him and he became an infamous tyrant. Condal went on to point out that this may also explain why Aegon I avoided unnecessary loss of life during the Conquest, raising up lords who surrendered as his vassals (i.e. the Starks, Lannisters, Arryns) instead of utterly crushing them (which he did sparingly, such as at Harrenhal, and only after he gave Harren the Black the option to surrender).
This may retroactively explain several other points about the early Targaryen kings, such as why Aegon I eventually withdrew from the First Dornish War after a decade of fighting. Facing heavy attrition from guerrilla resistance, as he got older Aegon may have realized the White Walkers probably weren't returning in his own lifetime, so he didn't need to keep exhausting his armies to force the last of the Seven Kingdoms into his realm while he still lived. Indeed, the First Dornish War ended when the new Prince of Dorne sent him a mysterious letter whose contents are unknown to history. This may also explain why his son Aenys Targaryen was indecisive against rebellions early in his reign and hesitated to crush the Faith Militant with dragons: if he thought the return of the White Walkers was relatively imminent, he wouldn't want to waste manpower on civil wars.
George R.R. Martin himself made a guarded statement about the prophecy in a co-interview with Ryan Condal in Vanity Fair, hesitant to reveal too many new pieces of information from future books, but acknowledging that the early Targaryen kings' actions were shaped by the fact that they did not know the White Walkers' return was over 200 years in the future, but thought it would happen relatively soon for them:
- "I don't want to give too much away, because some of this is going to be in the later books, but this is 200 years before the events of Game of Thrones. There was no sell-by date on that prophecy. That's the issue. The Targaryens that know about it are all thinking, Okay, this is going to happen in my lifetime, I have to be prepared! Or, It's going to happen in my son's lifetime. Nobody said it's going to happen 200 years from now. If the Dance of the Dragons had not happened, what would've happened to the next generation? What would've happened in the generation after that? Yeah, there's a lot to be unwound there."[25]
Timeline
The timeline has been moved around somewhat from the book Fire & Blood, both due to condensation as well as the need to age-up the younger actors. This is directly comparable to how Game of Thrones aged-up Daenerys Targaryen from 14 to 16 in Season 1: under UK filming law, a fictional character cannot be portrayed having sex under the age of 16, regardless of the actor's actual age (Emilia Clarke was 23 years old when playing the 16 year-old Daenerys). Rhaenyra and Alicent are about 15 years old in this first episode, but Rhaenyra was only about 9 years old when her mother died in the book.
- Adult Rhaenyra directly states in the opening voiceover that the Great Council at Harrenhal took place in the year 101 (at no point in Game of Thrones did any character state a calendar year in dialogue).
- A title card then says that the rest of the episode takes place in the ninth year of Viserys I's reign. In the book, Queen Aemma died in the second year of his reign, 105 AC.
- Just as in Game of Thrones the time since Robert's Rebellion was expanded from 15 to 17 years, it appears that Queen Aemma's death was postponed by seven years - and all the characters aged-up accordingly.
The title card of the episode states that the main part of "The Heirs of the Dragon" takes place in the ninth year of Viserys I's reign, 172 years before the birth of Daenerys Targaryen. Although props from Game of Thrones establish that Robert Baratheon became king in 280 AC (meaning Daenerys was born in 281), the title card appears to have used Daenerys's birth year from the book series (284). In the book series, Viserys I's ninth year as king was 112 AC, which has also been confirmed as the year "The Heirs of the Dragon" takes place during in supplementary material.[26]
There are some issues when characters round timespans to broad numbers:
- The opening voiceover says that Jaehaerys's reign lasted almost 60 years. In the books, his reign was exactly 55 years long.
- Rhaenys remarks that there hasn't been a real war since Maegor died "70 years ago". Maegor was directly succeeded by Jaehaerys, however: it's possible someone took the dialogue "almost 60 years" and added a decade for Viserys's reign, rounding up from 9 years to 10 years. If the current calendar year is 112 AC, then Maegor's death was actually 61 or 64 years ago according to the dates in the books (in which case, Rhaenys is just rounding up a bit too much).

- This episode had the highest ever viewership for an HBO TV series premiere: within just the United States, it had 9.99 million viewers combined across HBO's linear cable channel and the HBO Max streaming service. The Game of Thrones: Season 8 premiere had 17.9 million viewers, though HBO's leadership said in advance that they didn't expect a new TV show to initially match the viewership numbers of its flagship progenitor's much-anticipated final season, which was the culmination of almost a decade of programming.[40]
- The UK premiere also set viewership records for Sky Atlantic, with 1.39 million first-day viewers - of which only about 394,000 watched on the linear cable time slot at 9 p.m. local time, meaning that 1 million watched earlier in the day on streaming services (as the global release was at 2 a.m. local time). This made it the biggest drama launch ever on Sky Atlantic.[41]
Altered and deleted scenes
- The scene of Baelon's birth was shortened: as Viserys holds the Valyrian steel dagger, a maester approaches him to inform him that Baelon is dead.[42]
- A scene after Aemma's death, in which Viserys hesitantly meets with Daemon to officially name him heir and tell him Aegon's prophecy, before ultimately deciding not to.[43]

"The Lord of the Tides" is the eighth episode of the first season of House of the Dragon. It is the eighth episode of the series overall. It premiered on October 9, 2022 on HBO and HBO Max. It was written by Eileen Shim and directed by Geeta Vasant Patel.
Premise
Six years later. With the Driftmark succession suddenly critical, Rhaenyra attempts to strike a bargain with Rhaenys.
Synopsis
At High Tide
Six years have passed since the funeral of Laena Velaryon. In the Hall of Nine, Princess Rhaenys Targaryen, attended by her granddaughter Baela Targaryen, listens to Maester Kelvyn reporting that her husband, Lord Corlys Velaryon, who has spent that time fighting to maintain Westeros's hold on the Stepstones, has been seriously wounded in an ambush by Triarchy forces. His ship is expected to return to Driftmark in three days, but his fever might claim his life by then. Ser Vaemond Velaryon, in attendance, insists that as Corlys's closest kin, he should inherit Driftmark if his elder brother dies, rather than Corlys's preferred choice of Lucerys Velaryon, who Vaemond asserts is a bastard son of Harwin Strong. When Rhaenys warns that her cousin, King Viserys, would have Vaemond's tongue for such words, Vaemond retorts that Alicent Hightower rules in Viserys's stead, and he expects her to ratify his claim to Driftmark.
On Dragonstone
Prince Daemon Targaryen climbs the Dragonmont, the volcano overlooking Dragonstone castle, where he recovers three dragon eggs laid by Syrax from a nest within the volcano, handing them over to the Dragonkeepers upon his return. Within the castle, a pregnant Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen watches her eldest son, Prince Jacaerys Velaryon reciting High Valyrian under the tutelage of Maester Gerardys, reassuring her son when he keeps reprimanding himself for making mistakes that he has plenty of time to learn. Rhaenyra dismisses her eldest son and his younger brother, Joffrey, along with the maester as Daemon enters, wanting to discuss a letter sent to them by Baela from Driftmark. Rhaenyra is furious at Vaemond's intentions, particularly since she expects Alicent and Otto Hightower to side with him, noting that if Lucerys's claim to Driftmark is overturned, by extension, Jace's and her own claims to the Iron Throne will be jeopardized. Rhaenyra is also concerned that the letter mentions Rhaenys has returned to court, since they cannot be sure of her intentions. Daemon confidently asserts Rhaenys will not support Vaemond, given her taking Baela as her ward. Rhaenyra argues that Rhaenys still blames them for the death of her son Laenor, and has only taken in Baela to honor her daughter Laena's memory. Both conclude that they need to return to King's Landing to fight for Luke's claim.
In King's Landing
Rhaenyra and Daemon arrive, accompanied by her three sons and Daemon's younger daughter, Rhaena, at the Red Keep, receiving a minimalist greeting with only Lord Allun Caswell in attendance. Their anger at the lack of reception only grows when they discover that in their absence, the Red Keep is now festooned with iconography of the Faith of the Seven; Rhaenyra outright states she barely recognizes her old home.
In Viserys's chambers, Rhaenyra and Daemon find his model city of Old Valyria covered in dust and cobwebs, having been unattended for years. Much to their horror, Viserys is bedridden, disorientated and clearly in pain, his hair all but gone, his teeth rotten, and his face swathed in bandages. Daemon brings up the matter of Corlys being wounded in the Stepstones and the succession of Driftmark being disputed, only for a delirious Viserys to insist both are already settled. Daemon urges Viserys to support Lucerys's claim over Vaemond's, but Viserys confusedly remarks that Alicent and Otto attend to court business. A child crying out behind them draws Viserys's attention, so Rhaenyra introduces her father to his youngest grandsons from her marriage to Daemon: Aegon and Viserys. Viserys is delighted to see the children, joking the younger has a name fit for a king. The children start to wail, and Viserys, stricken by a sudden onset of pain, insists he needs his tea, pointing to a cup by his bedside. Once he has drunk, Daemon takes the cup from his brother and sniffs it, frowning as he recognizes the scent of its contents.
Ser Harrold Westerling interrupts a meeting of the Small Council to inform them of Rhaenyra and Daemon's arrival. The Council briefly discusses the succession of Driftmark; Grand Maester Orwyle remarks that Corlys wanted Lucerys to succeed him, with Lord Lyman Beesbury agreeing that as Laenor's son, Lucerys is the rightful heir. Lord Jasper Wylde argues that Corlys never formally named Lucerys as his heir, while Ser Tyland Lannister notes that Lucerys has no experience commanding ships, a necessity to hold the position of Lord of the Tides. Queen Alicent declares the claimants can present their petitions the following morning, taking her leave to go and meet Rhaenyra and Daemon, only to be informed by Ser Erryk Cargyll (whom she briefly mistakes for his twin brother Arryk) there has been an incident in Prince Aegon's chambers. In the queen's apartments, Alicent's lady-in-waiting, Talya, presents the Queen with a weeping girl, Dyana, one of Princess Helaena Targaryen's maids, confirming no one else has seen her. At Alicent's request, Dyana tearfully explains that when she tried to serve Prince Aegon wine, he drunkenly forced himself on her. Alicent is sympathetic to the girl, confirming she believes that Dyana is telling the truth, but buys Dyana's silence with a pouch of gold and forces her to drink Moon tea, noting that others might dismiss her testimony. Afterwards, a furious Alicent confronts a drunken Aegon in his chambers, berating him for his assault on Dyanna, only the latest of many, bringing shame on her and his wife with his conduct, disgustedly declaring Aegon no son of hers. Aegon feebly protests at the weight of expectations placed upon him and the fact nothing he does ever satisfies his parents, but Alicent is unsympathetic. When Helaena, unaware of what has happened, enters the room and asks if anyone has seen Dyana, Alicent breaks down in tears and embraces her daughter.
In Viserys's room, Rhaenyra and Daemon discuss the extent of his deterioration when Alicent enters the room. The couple outright accuse Alicent and Otto of keeping Viserys stupefied on milk of the poppy so that they can rule in his name without interference. When Alicent protests that Viserys's condition leaves him in agony and the maesters recommended such treatment, Daemon sarcastically asks if the maesters also prescribed stripping the Red Keep of Targaryen heraldry in favor of the iconography of the Seven. Alicent piously retorts such devotional displays are meant only to guide and remind of a higher authority. When Rhaenyra questions which authority will decide on her son's right to his own inheritance, Alicent smugly replies that will be her, and her father in his capacity as Hand of the King. In the Red Keep's yard, Jace fondly reminisces about their boyhood days training there, while Luke is more self-conscious of the stares of the courtiers, aware that his resemblance to Harwin Strong rather than Laenor Velaryon undermines his claim to Driftmark. The brothers notice a crowd forming around a sparring match; to their shock, they see Criston Cole duelling their uncle, Prince Aemond Targaryen, who has grown into a formidable warrior since they last met. Aemond defeats Cole, who compliments the victory, remarking Aemond will swiftly be winning tourneys before long. Aemond makes clear he has no interest in such things before noticing his nephews in the crowd, asking Jace and Luke if they've come to train with a menacing edge in his voice. Jace and Luke are saved from having to answer by the arrival of Vaemond, escorted by his retinue and several Hightower guardsmen. Vaemond meets privately with Otto and Alicent, pledging the Velaryon fleet to support them in return for acknowledging him as heir to Driftmark.
In the Red Keep's godswood, Rhaenyra meets with Rhaenys, accompanied by Rhaena. Rhaenys is delighted to see her younger granddaughter, but less so Rhaenyra, who asks Rhaena leave to let the older women talk privately. Rhaenyra concludes Rhaenys is in King's Landing to advocate for her own claim to Driftmark, rather than in support of Vaemond. Rhaenyra insists that the proceedings are a trap engineered by Otto and Alicent meant to insultingly denounce Lucerys as illegitimate; an angry Rhaenys snaps Rhaenyra did worse when she cuckolded Laenor. Rhaenyra insists that she loved Laenor in her own way and that she was uninvolved in his death. She also offers to betroth Jace and Luke to Baela and Rhaena, allowing Baela to be Jace's Queen and ensuring rule of Driftmark will pass through Laena's line by Rhaena as Rhaenys originally wished. Rhaenys seemingly rebuffs the offer, remarking that she must stand alone.
That night, as a storm batters King's Landing, Rhaenyra sits at Viserys' bedside. He awakes and briefly mistakes her for Alicent before Rhaenyra corrects him. Rhaenyra then asks her father if he believe the Song of Ice and Fire, the prophetic dream of Aegon the Conqueror, is a true prophecy. She reminds Viserys that he told her it was their duty to hold the realm united against the return of a coming evil, but warns his naming her heir divided the realm and she has found the burden of that duty a hard one to bear. Rhaenyra tearfully pleads for her father to defend her and her children if he believes the dream true, but Viserys is too delirious from pain, illness and medication to respond, and Rhaenyra weeps at the realization even her beloved father has forsaken her to fend for herself.
The next morning, as Orwyle and several acolytes tend to Viserys's affliction, the king orders Otto to arrange a supper that night with all of his family in attendance, as well as refusing milk of the poppy. Later that day in the throne room, Otto, seated on the Iron Throne in Viserys's stead in his role as Hand of the King, presides over the succession of Driftmark in the event of Lord Corlys's death. Vaemond speaks first, citing House Velaryon's history as a survivor of the Doom of Valyria, as well as citing himself as Corlys's closest kin and a true heir of Velaryon blood. Rhaenyra scornfully accuses Vaemond of serving nothing but his own ambition in undermining the succession of Laenor's trueborn son and Corlys's preferred successor, only to be silenced by Alicent. Once Vaemond's petition is concluded, Otto invites Rhaenyra to speak on Lucerys's behalf. She begins by denouncing the entire proceeding as a farce, but before she can speak further, the throne room doors open and, to the incredulity of all present, Viserys hobbles into the throne room, clearly in pain but determined to support his daughter one last time. Viserys declares his intention to sit the throne and preside over the ruling, forcing Otto to withdraw. He struggles to climb the steps of the Iron Throne, initially dismissing the offer of Ser Erryk's help, but when he stumbles a second time, out of breath from exertion, his crown falls from his head and another figure steps forward to help. Viserys is about to rebuff them, when he realises it is Daemon, his face drawn by concern for his older brother, and Viserys allows Daemon to help him up the steps and place the crown upon his head once more.
Viserys declares his confusion as to why a settled succession is being debated, noting the only person fit to give further insight into Corlys's wishes would be his wife, Rhaenys. Rhaenys steps forward and, to the shock and anger of Vaemond, Otto and Alicent, asserts that Corlys always wanted Lucerys to succeed him as Lord of Driftmark, a decision she supports...as she is confident Corlys would support her decision to accept Rhaenyra's proposal to betroth Jace and Luke to Baela and Rhaena. Viserys declares the matter settled, reaffirming Lucerys as heir to Driftmark and the next Lord of the Tides. An outraged Vaemond furiously snaps that Viserys has no authority to decide House Velaryon's fate when he broke centuries of tradition and Westerosi law to install his daughter as heir, angrily denouncing Lucerys as no true Velaryon. Angered by Vaemond's presumption, Viserys coldly reminds Vaemond he is nothing more than a second son, whereas Lucerys is the king's truborn grandson. Vaemond refuses to be silent, raging that he will not allow House Velaryon to end on account of Lucerys, holding his tongue before openly calling the boy a bastard. Daemon, glaring at Vaemond, dares him to say the word that will damn him, and Vaemond, too blinded by rage to hold back, bellows that Rhaenyra's children are bastards and she is a whore. As the court murmurs at this outburst, an apoplectic Viserys rises to his feet and draws his dagger, vowing to take Vaemond's tongue for the insult to his daughter's honor. Before he can, Daemon slices off the top of Vaemond's skull with Dark Sister, sardonically quipping that Vaemond "can keep his tongue", before casually cleaning and sheathing Dark Sister as Otto bellows at the Kingsguard to disarm Daemon. The shock and exertion overcome Viserys who collapses in pain on the throne, but despite a panicking Rhaenyra and Alicent pleading with him to take medical assistance, Viserys refuses, insisting he must make things right.
Later that evening, Rhaenys watches as the Silent Sisters prepare Vaemond's body for burial. Grand Maester Orwyle urges her to leave, noting it is considered bad luck to look upon the face of death, but Rhaenys dismisses him, remarking that the Stranger, who has come for her family so many times, no longer cares if her eyes are open or closed to him.

Behind the scenes
General
- The title of the episode refers to the main title borne by the head of House Velaryon, "Lord of the Tides."
- With a runtime of 68 minutes, this episode is the longest of the season, and the longest of the series so far.
- This is the last major time jump of the series, taking place six years after "Driftmark." Younger characters born in previous episodes are now portrayed by their permanent actors.
- Tom Glynn-Carney replaces Ty Tennant as the adult Aegon Targaryen.
- Phia Saban replaces Evie Allen as the adult Helaena Targaryen.
- Ewan Mitchell replaces Leo Ashton as the adult Aemond Targaryen.
- Harry Collett replaces Leo Hart as the teenage Jacaerys Velaryon.
- Elliot Grihault replaces Harvey Sadler as the teenage Lucerys Velaryon.
- Bethany Antonia replaces Shani Smethurst as the teenage Baela Targaryen.
- Phoebe Campbell replaces Eva Ossei-Gerning as the teenage Rhaena Targaryen.
- This is the only episode of the series so far to feature no dragons, although it does feature dragon eggs.
- When Alicent enters the room where Rhaenyra and Daemon are, the scars on Rhaenyra's left forearm (the result of Alicent's attack in the previous episode) are seen.
- The conversation between Lucerys and Jace shows that they are aware of their father's identity.
- In the final scene, Viserys, whose health has seriously deteriorated, mistakes Alicent for Rhaenyra; he had previously talked about "The Song of Ice and Fire" only with Rhaenyra and his last conversation was a continuation of that he had with his daughter the night prior.
- When Rhaenyra reunites with her father, Viserys mistakes her for Alicent, foreshadowing him making the reverse mistake
- Viserys uses his dying words to proclaim his belief that Rhaenyra is The Prince That Was Promised. Unfortunately, Alicent, not privy to information on Aegon's dream prior, misinterprets Viserys's mentioning "Aegon" as indicating he wishes their son Aegon to succeed him as king.
- It is the third time Aegon the Conqueror's prophetical dream is mentioned in the show (following "The Heirs of the Dragon" and "King of the Narrow Sea"). Similarly to the previous references, it does not include the second part of Rhaegar's enigmatic words "The dragon has three heads".
- The part in which Viserys dropped his crown, and Daemon picked it up and handed it back to Viserys, was not in the original script. The episode's director Geeta Patel revealed that the touching moment was completely unplanned.[1]
- Actor Paddy Considine later confirmed Viserys's last words at his deathbed "No more. No more. My love." were also improvised.[2]
- Throughout the episode, the greens are to the right of Viserys, the side that is rotting and missing an eye, while the blacks are on the side with his remaining eye: when he is on the Iron Throne, at the dinner table, and when he is in bed (as Rhaenyra and Daemon approach from Viserys's left while, later on, Alicent approaches on the right).
- There is a slight resemblance between the fates of Vaemond and Eddard Stark: each of them correctly accused a queen (Eddard - Cersei, Vaemond - Rhaenyra) that her children were bastards, and was beheaded for that.
Altered and deleted scenes
- Daemon toasting Viserys at the last supper. This was cut because director Geeta Patel felt that this undercut the power of the previous moment between the two brothers in the throne room.[3]

"The Green Council" is the ninth episode of the first season of House of the Dragon. It is the ninth episode of the series overall. It premiered on October 16, 2022 on HBO and HBO Max. It was written by Sara Hess and directed by Clare Kilner.
Premise
While Alicent enlists Cole and Aemond to track down Aegon, Otto gathers the great houses of Westeros to affirm their allegiance.
Synopsis
The coup begins
In the dead of night, a servant boy discovers King Viserys has died in his sleep and immediately informs Queen Alicent Hightower's lady in waiting, Talya, who wakes and alerts her mistress to her husband's passing. A tearful Alicent hastily dresses and heads to her father's chambers in the Tower of the Hand, informing him of the king's death and her husband's seeming choice on his deathbed to rename his heir as her eldest son Aegon. Unbeknowst to them, Talya lights a candelabra in the window of Viserys's chamber as a signal to someone in King's Landing.
The Small Council is hastily convened; Ser Tyland Lannister asks what matter could not have waited until dawn, sarcastically asking if Dorne was invaded, only to be silenced when Otto informs him the King is dead. Otto sombrely notes that they grieve for their fallen sovereign, dubbing the late king "Viserys the Peaceful", before noting that Viserys has given them a final gift in naming Aegon as his heir. Tyland notes that they can now proceed with his blessing on their long laid plans, to which Otto agrees. As he begins suggesting they replace two captains in the City Watch known to be loyal to Daemon, an appalled Alicent demands to know why she was not informed members of the council were plotting to install her son as heir without her knowledge, to which Lord Jasper Wylde replies they did not want to sully her with their schemes. Lord Commander Harrold Westerling and Lord Lyman Beesbury are also appalled by this subterfuge, with the latter furiously raging at the other council members for plotting to replace Viserys's chosen heir, his eldest daughter Rhaenyra with an imposter. Tyland protests that Aegon, the king's first born son, is hardly an imposter; when Lyman responds that hundreds of lords and landed knights swore fealty to Rhaenyra as heir, Tyland retorts that was twenty years ago, with most of those having since died. Jasper Wylde also asserts that whether they were plotting is now irrelevant since the king changed his mind, to which a furious Lyman snaps that he has known Viserys longer than any of the other incumbents on the Small Council, and refuses to believe Viserys, who was a tireless advocate of his daughter's right to the Iron Throne for decades, would change his mind on his deathbed, noting as well the suspiciousness in that the only witness to this change of heart is the new heir's mother, angrily accusing them all of treason. Grand Maester Orwyle tries to calm matters, but Lyman refuses to be silenced, going so far as to insinuate one or more members of the Small Council committed regicide, given Viserys was well enough the previous day. Before he can say more, Criston Cole angrily seizes Lyman and forces him back into his seat; unfortunately, the force Cole uses slams the frail Lyman's head into the table, fatally cracking his skull to the horror of all. A furious Harrold draws his sword and orders Cole to forfeit his white cloak, only for Cole to draw his own blade, justifying his actions as retribution for Beesbury slandering the queen with accusations of regicide. Before the two Kingsguard can come to blows, Alicent and Otto order them to stand down. Orwyle requests leave to remove Lyman's body from the room, only for Otto to refuse, insisting the council chamber doors will remain shut until their business is concluded.
As Otto and Tyland begin discussing dividing the gold within the royal treasury, Alicent asks of Rhaenyra. Otto replies that they cannot allow the former heir to rally support for her claim. When an incredulous Alicent infers Otto intends to imprison Rhaenyra and her family, Otto asserts they will be given the chance to publicly swear obeisance to the new king. Alicent scoffs that neither Rhaenyra nor Daemon will ever do so, only to realize that Otto and his fellow conspirators mean to kill Rhaenyra and her family. Orwyle insists leaving a rival claimant alive will only invite bloodshed, while Otto asserts the killings a necessary sacrifice to ensure Aegon's succession, insisting Viserys would not want any unsavory power squabbles. A furious Alicent shouts that Viserys would never have condoned the murder of his beloved daughter, and threatens Jasper with exile to the Night's Watch when he tries to speak up in favor of the plan, though Alicent cannot offer an alternative when Tyland asks for one. Otto orders Harrold to take his knights to Dragonstone to assassinate Rhaenyra and her family; a disgusted Harrold resigns from the Kingsguard in protest.
The hunt for Aegon
The beast beneath the boards
But as the Greens watch the seeming successful completion of their plans, the floor of the Dragonpit erupts, and the cheering of the crowd turns to screams of panic as a colossal dragon claws its way out from the caverns below the main hall, flattening panicking spectators with its tail and talons. Terrified smallfolk try to escape in all directions, either climbing up to the Dragonpit's upper floors, or streaming through the gates as the gold cloaks desperately try to close them, though some are crushed by fallen debris sent flying by the rampaging dragon or swept into the hole created by its escape. As the Greens on the dais watch in incredulous horror, the dragon emerges from the pall of ash and debris thrown up by its escape, revealing itself to be Meleys, with Rhaenys sat astride her back, clad in an ornate suit of dragonrider armor. A panicking Otto bellows at the gold cloaks to open the Dragonpit's doors to allow escape, but his commands go unheard over the chaos as Rhaenys directs Meleys towards the dais. With the fury of the Red Queen and the Queen Who Never Was bearing down on them, Alicent orders Criston to get Helaena to safety before placing herself between Aegon and the snarling dragon. Despite having the entire Green faction at her mercy, whether out of respect for Alicent's love for her son or refusal to make herself a kinslayer, Rhaenys withholds giving Meleys the command to kill.
As the Red Queen roars in fury at them, Rhaenys gives Alicent a cold look, signaling her rejection of Alicent's request for her support, before directing Meleys towards the Dragonpit's closing doors, the dragon furling her wings about her and gliding through the doors with inches to spare, before flying off. Alicent and Aegon warily watch Rhaenys go, aware she is likely heading straight to Dragonstone to inform Rhaenyra of what has happened, as well as fearing how Rhaenyra will react when she learns of her father's death and the usurpation of her throne.

Behind the scenes
- The episode title refers to the fact that the Small Council (except Lyman Beesbury) has been manned entirely by the Greens.
- This is the first episode in which Daemon Targaryen and Rhaenyra Targaryen do not appear.
- In contrast to the former episodes, this episode begins at the point the previous episode ended, without jumping years ahead.
- This episode takes place entirely at King's Landing.
- The episode follows the tradition of Game of Thrones to include a pivotal event (typically a battle) in the ninth episode of each season.
- Lord Boremund Baratheon dies at some point between 116 and 132 AC, having been succeeded by his son Borros Baratheon as the Lord of Storm's End (acknowledged by Ser Tyland Lannister at the Small Council).
- Aemond states that he is next in line after Aegon. Even if Aemond's older sister Helaena and Aegon's daughter Jaehaera are excluded from the line of succession, Aegon still has a son who would seemingly come before Aemond.
- Lyman Beesbury states that he is 76 years old. In Fire & Blood, he is 80. 76 was the age of Bill Paterson, the actor who portrays him, at the time of filming.[1]
- The discussion at the council meeting about Rhaenyra is similar to the discussion of Robert Baratheon's Small Council whether to assassinate Daenerys Targaryen ("The Wolf and the Lion"; A Game of Thrones, Eddard VIII); similarly to Eddard Stark, Alicent objects to kill Rhaenyra, and Harrold Westerling disdainfully resigns from his office. In the book, Barristan Selmy was also against, but unlike Ser Harrold, he did not resign.
- It is unknown what stopped Rhaenys from destroying the Greens, thus preventing the subsequent war. Maybe she did not want to become a kinslayer by killing Viserys's offsprings; or, since Alicent had not harmed her though she could, Rhaenys chose to spare her life; or did not want to get herself involved in the conflict between the Greens and the blacks; or thought her demonstration of power was enough to discourage the Greens (as things turn to be, it was not). In the book, Rhaenys was not in King's Landing at that point, and no one interrupted Aegon's coronation.
- Rhaenys does provide an explanation for her refusal to kill the Greens in the next episode after Daemon blames her for letting them live, stating that while she knew that a war would erupt, she considered that she was not the one who should start it.
- The seedy place which Aemond and Ser Criston visit is known as "rat pit". Such places that can be found in the slum districts, like Flea Bottom, of major cities in Westeros. By contrast, in Slaver's Bay such establishments operate openly and officially (A Storm of Swords, Daenerys II).
- As happened in former episodes ("The Princess and the Queen", "Driftmark"), Helaena keeps revealing her prophetic abilities: her words "there is a beast beneath the boards" foreshadow the final scene.
- Aegon wears the black crown Aegon the Conqueror and Maegor the Cruel wore, not the golden crown his father and great-grandfather wore; moreover, Aegon wields Blackfyre, which was also used by Aegon I and Maegor the Cruel. These may foreshadow that Aegon's reign will be plagued with battles, not peaceful as was during the reign periods of Jaehaerys and Viserys.
- In "The Heirs of the Dragon", Viserys told Aemma about a dream he had: "Our son was born wearing Aegon's iron crown. And I heard the sound of thundering hooves, splintering shields, and ringing swords, and I placed our son upon the Iron Throne... as the bells of the Grand Sept tolled and all the dragons roared as one." The dream could be a foreshadowing of Aegon's coronation, though not all its details match the final scene (Aegon is not Aemma's son, there was only one dragon).
- Rhaenys's act of killing civilians slightly resembles what Daenerys Targaryen will do many years later, though the latter was in much bigger scale; in both cases, there were no early warning signs that they were capable of committing such inhumane deeds (there were hints that Daenerys was gradually succumbing to the Targaryen madness, but their significance became clear only after the massacre she committed).
- Alicent tells Rhaenys "I loved my husband, but I will speak the truth we both know. You should've been queen". Alicent must have missed the irony: she says Rhaenys was more competent to reign than Viserys, and at the same time requests Rhaenys to support her drunken, irresponsible, fool son Aegon's claim to the throne, instead of Rhaenyra who is clearly a better choice for a monarch.
In the books

Premise
While mourning a tragic loss, Rhaenyra tries to hold the realm together, and Daemon prepares for war.
Synopsis
Dark wings, dark words
A pregnant Rhaenyra Targaryen finds her second son, Lucerys Velaryon studying the island of Driftmark on the Painted Table of Dragonstone; Lucerys insists that lordship should have passed to Vaemond Velaryon rather than himself. Rhaenyra assures her son that she felt the same way when her father Viserys named her as his heir, and promises that just as Viserys prepared her to play that part, she will do the same for him. The moment between mother and son is interrupted by Ser Lorent Marbrand of the Kingsguard, who informs Rhaenyra that Princess Rhaenys has arrived on dragonback and requests an audience with her and Prince Daemon.
Ser Lorent leads Rhaenys in; Rhaenyra asks if there is word of her husband Corlys's recovery, but Rhaenys interrupts to inform Rhaenyra that her father is dead and her half-brother Aegon has been crowned as his successor. A stunned Daemon asks how his brother died; when Rhaenys admits ignorance, Daemon accuses Alicent Hightower of having murdered him. Rhaenys explains that she was made a prisoner in her own chambers while the Greens made their preparations, and that she witnessed Aegon's coronation at the Dragonpit before escaping atop Meleys. Rhaenyra is appalled to learn the Greens crowned Aegon before the masses of King's Landing, knowing as Rhaenys reiterates the masses will now see Aegon as the rightful king. When Daemon angrily demands to know why Rhaenys didn't burn the Greens when she had them at her mercy, Rhaenys replies that while war will follow, it is not her place to declare war; she only brought the warning out of loyalty to her house and husband. Rhaenys advises Rhaenyra to leave Dragonstone with her family before the Greens come for her, when Rhaenyra doubles over in pain. She reaches beneath her dress, her fingers coming away bloody; the shock of the news has sent her into premature labor.
As Rhaenyra struggles with her labor pains, attended to Maester Gerardys and several midwives, fearful because Rhaenyra's pregnancy is far from full term, Daemon holds council with the lords of the Narrow Sea, the Kingsguard, and the captains in command of Dragonstone's garrison; he warns them to watch for any small ships trying to land on the island, fearing that the Greens may try a stealth attack against them, and tells his captains to conscript the Dragonkeepers if need be to bolster their numbers. Rhaenys finds Jace and Luke sparring under the watchful eye of Ser Steffon Darklyn and brings them to their mother's chamber, where Rhaenyra informs them of their grandfather's death and Aegon's usurpation of the Iron Throne, commanding that nothing is to be done without her leave.
Daemon is informed by Lord Bartimos Celtigar that Lord Corlys's fever has broken and he has departed Evenfall, though his destination is unclear. Daemon commands ravens be sent to rally their closest allies and declares his intention to fly to Riverrun to secure House Tully's allegiance and rally the riverlords when Jace enters and relays his mother's command. Daemon disregards Jace, commands Lord Celtigar to send the ravens, and instructs Jace and the Kingsguard to follow him to the Dragonmont. On the slopes, Daemon questions Lorent and Steffon as to where their allegiances lie, compelling them to swear oaths of loyalty to Rhaenyra as queen and Jace as her heir, having Caraxes loom over the two knights to warn them of the price of treason. In her chambers, a screaming Rhaenyra, ignoring the offers of the midwives to help her, gives birth to a stillborn daughter that she had planned to name Visenya; she later prepares the child for burial under the watchful eye of the Silent Sisters while Daemon goes out to the beach to grieve. A small funeral is held the next day, interrupted by the arrival of Ser Erryk Cargyll, who kneels before Rhaenyra, declares his loyalty to her, and offers her her father's crown, stolen from the Red Keep in the confusion of the Greens' coup. Daemon places the crown on Rhaenyra's head and declares her his queen. Her sons, stepdaughters, Kingsguard, and the congregation (save Rhaenys) kneel before Rhaenyra as the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
The Black Council
Rhaenyra and her attendant lords gather around the Painted Table; Rhaenyra accepts a cup of wine from her stepdaughter and cousin Rhaena Targaryen, serving as cupbearer in the same capacity Rhaenyra once did, before asking for a report. Daemon informs her that Dragonstone's garrison stands at 30 knights, 100 crossbowmen, and 300 men-at-arms; sufficient to defend the island, but not to conquer Westeros. Daemon adds that he has sent word to men in the City Watch whose loyalty he can count on, but he cannot say how many will answer, while Gerardys confirms that Houses Celtigar, Massey, Darklyn, Staunton, and Bar Emmon have affirmed their loyalty. Rhaenyra asserts that House Arryn and the Vale will support her on account of their kinship through her late mother Aemma Arryn. Gerardys adds that he has also sent a raven to Lord Grover Tully, an old friend of her father's, to sway his support, though Rhaenyra insists that the fickle Grover will need to be convinced of the blacks' strength and assurance of support should war break out; Daemon insists that he will treat with Grover personally. Ser Steffon mentions Storm's End and Winterfell; Lord Celtigar reminds them of House Stark's reputation as honorable oathkeepers and asserts that the other Northern houses will follow where the Starks lead, while Rhaenyra remarks that Lord Borros Baratheon will need to be reminded of his late father Boremund's oath. Rhaenyra then turns her attention to Rhaenys, asking for news from Driftmark; Rhaenys remarks that Corlys is sailing to Dragonstone, though she demurs when Daemon assumes that he intends to declare for Rhaenyra. Daemon asserts that House Lannister will back the Greens, as Tyland has been a loyal supporter of Otto's on the Small Council for years, and the Greens will need the Lannister fleet if the Velaryons choose to back Rhaenyra. Given that House Lannister's allegiance will ensure that the Westerlands support the Greens, Daemon asserts that the support of the Riverlands to the black cause will be essential.
Lord Celtigar interrupts, arguing that talk of fighting men is irrelevant when Rhaenyra's forces command dragons in numbers not wielded in war since the Valyrian Freehold. Rhaenyra points out that the Greens command dragons too, but Daemon adds that they only have three adult dragons (Vhagar, Sunfyre, and Dreamfyre), while in addition to Caraxes, Syrax, and Meleys, the blacks possess Vermax, Arrax, and Tyraxes with Rhaenyra's sons and Moondancer with Baela. He also notes there are several unclaimed dragons in need of riders; Seasmoke, Vermithor and Silverwing, as well as three feral dragons (Grey Ghost, Sheepstealer, and the Cannibal) living wild on Dragonstone. Daemon proposes seizing Harrenhal as a base of operations and using the dragons to lay waste to King's Landing, but before further discussion can be had, Ser Erryk interrupts to inform them a galleon is approaching the island, flying the banner of a three-headed green dragon. Daemon grabs Dark Sister and order the garrison to battle positions.
The Greens' terms
On the bridge leading to Dragonstone, Daemon, the three Kingsguard knights, and a detachment of Dragonstone's garrison intercept the Greens' negotiation party, headed by Ser Otto Hightower, accompanied by Ser Arryk Cargyll, Grand Maester Orwyle, and several of his own guards. Otto declares that he has been instructed by the dowager queen Alicent to offer terms to Rhaenyra, who arrives atop Syrax. Otto greets her as "princess;" Rhaenyra icily retorts that she is Queen Rhaenyra, and Otto and his companions are all traitors. Otto presents the terms that King Aegon II is offering: in return for Rhaenyra publicly acknowledging him as king, she will keep Dragonstone, and the castle will pass to her son Jacaerys after her death; Lucerys will be confirmed as heir to Driftmark and the lands and holdings of House Velaryon; Rhaenyra's sons by Daemon will be given places of honor at court—Aegon the Younger as the king's squire and Viserys as his cupbearer; and King Aegon will pardon any knight or lord who conspired with Rhaenyra against his ascent to the throne.
Daemon hatefully declares that he would rather feed his sons to dragons than have them carry cups and shields for Aegon, venomously calling his nephew a "drunken, usurper cunt of a king." Otto retorts that Aegon was crowned by a septon of the Faith before the eyes of thousands, and his possession of Aegon the Conqueror's crown, sword, and name give him greater legitimacy, while adding that the Greens have also sent terms to Houses Stark, Tully and Baratheon to win their loyalty. Rhaenyra asserts those three houses all swore allegiance to her when Viserys named her his heir; Otto smugly replies that old oaths will not make Rhaenyra queen, asserting that the succession changed the day Aegon was born, even if Viserys and Rhaenyra refused to see it. Outraged, a furious Rhaenyra rips Otto's badge of office from his cloak, denouncing him as a "fucking traitor" and no more Hand than Aegon is King.
Orwyle hands Otto a sheaf of parchment that he presents to Rhaenyra. On closer inspection, she sees it is a page torn from Ten Thousand Ships, a book that she and Alicent read when they were girls in the Red Keep's godswood twenty years ago. Otto asserts that Alicent still remembers when she and Rhaenyra cared deeply for each other in their childhood, and urges Rhaenyra to accept the terms for the sake of peace. Enraged at Otto's attempts to manipulate his wife, Daemon draws Dark Sister, declaring that Alicent can "have her answer now, stuffed in her father's mouth along with his withered cock," prompting both sides to draw their swords and Syrax to roar angrily at the threat to her rider, but Rhaenyra defuses the situation by telling Otto that King's Landing will have her answer on the morrow.
Around the Painted Table that evening, Rhaenyra and her advisors discuss the terms offered to them by the Greens. Daemon insists that while it is not easy for a man to kill a dragon, dragons can kill each other, and the fact that they have numerical superiority of dragons gives them an advantage over the Greens. Rhaenyra counters that she knows the histories of Valyria thanks to her father, and has no wish to rule over the wasteland of ash and bone that will be left at the end of a war between dragons. Lord Celtigar expresses incredulity that Rhaenyra is considering the terms offered by the Hightowers, but Rhaenyra asserts that her duty as her father's heir is to keep the realm stable and united rather than plunge it into war, even if it means that she does not sit on the Iron Throne. Daemon scoffs at this, protesting that the Greens have already declared war, and raises his voice at her inaction. Rhaenyra tells the other lords to clear the chamber, leaving only her and Daemon in the room.
Daemon insists that Rhaenyra cannot submit to the Hightowers, who have stolen her birthright, and urges that as queen, she is obligated to crush rebellion. Rhaenyra protests that they are bound by more than personal ambition, reminding Daemon of what her father told them about "The Song of Ice and Fire," Aegon the Conqueror's prophetic dream that a Targaryen must keep the realm united against the return of a great evil in the North, only for Daemon to seize her by the throat. Choking Rhaenyra, Daemon angrily hisses that Viserys was obsessed with omens and portents to give his feckless reign meaning, and asserts that dragons, not dreams, made House Targaryen kings. Daemon releases Rhaenyra, but though taken aback by his violence against her, Rhaenyra is stunned to realize that Viserys never told Daemon about the Conqueror's vision, indicating that he never in his life considered Daemon as his heir. Shaken at having raised a hand to his wife and the realization that Viserys never truly trusted him, Daemon withdraws.
In a bedchamber in Dragonstone, Corlys Velaryon awakes to find his wife sitting beside his bed. Rhaenys accuses him of having abandoned her and their granddaughters to go adventuring in the Stepstones. Corlys admits his error, insisting that returning to the sea was his way of coping with the deaths of their children. Rhaenys also alerts him to Vaemond's death; saddened by what ambitious pursuits have cost his family, Corlys insists to Rhaenys that he will abandon his pursuit of the Iron Throne, abstain from choosing a side in the conflict, and retire to Driftmark to spend their remaining days with their grandchildren. Rhaenys argues against it, reminding him that Jace, Luke, and Joffrey are all claimants to the Iron Throne, and the boys will never be safe while Aegon II holds the Iron Throne. Corlys is dismissive of the idea of supporting Rhaenyra, reminding Rhaenys that she was complicit in Laenor's death, but Rhaenys insists that Rhaenyra is the only one exercising restraint to prevent Westeros from sliding into wholesale war.
The next morning, Corlys, accompanied by Rhaenys, Baela, and Rhaena, joins a congregation of the Black Council. Rhaenyra quickly expresses her relief to see him healthy again, while Corlys offers his condolences for Viserys's death. When Corlys makes note of Daemon's absence, Rhaenyra demurs that other matters require his attention. Corlys considers the gathered lords of the Narrow Sea and bluntly declares them too few to win a war for the Iron Throne, as well as dismissing Rhaenyra's hopes that Houses Arryn, Stark, and Baratheon will support her. Rhaenyra asserts that, aside from her blood ties with the Arryns and Baratheons, all of the Great Houses swore to support her claim when Viserys named her heir; when Corlys points out that this includes House Hightower, who have now forsworn that oath, Rhaenyra reminds him that House Velaryon also swore to support her. After a brief look from his wife and his granddaughters (who have moved to stand with Jace and Luke) Corlys notes that Rhaenyra's house and his are bound by blood and a common cause, and insists that the Hightowers cannot be allowed to get away with their treason, asserting that House Velaryon and its fleet will support Rhaenyra. Rhaenyra thanks him and Rhaenys for their support, but insists that she will not be the first to strike, and that she wishes to know who will support her.
Corlys adds that, despite his near-death in the Stepstones, House Velaryon now controls the islands, having driven the Triarchy's forces out of the region and properly garrisoned the islands against their return. Corlys states that his men will institute a blockade of the shipping lanes that pass through the Stepstones, if they haven't already, and his fleet will place a second blockade across the Gullet, reinforced by Rhaenys atop Meleys at her own suggestion, to cut off all sea trade and travel to and from King's Landing. Lord Celtigar insists that a sea blockade and a landward siege could starve the Greens into surrender, but Rhaenyra asserts that to have enough men to surround King's Landing, they will need the support of Arryn, Baratheon, and Stark. Jace speaks up, volunteering himself and Luke to carry Rhaenyra's demands for their support on dragonback, as the lords will find it more difficult to refuse dragonriders than ravens. Corlys agrees, and Rhaenyra decides that Jace will travel first to the Eyrie and then to Winterfell to win the allegiance of Lady Jeyne Arryn and Lord Cregan Stark, while Luke goes to Storm's End to ensure Borros Baratheon's supports.
That evening, on the bridge to Dragonstone, Rhaenyra speaks with Jace and Luke before they depart on their mission. Rhaenyra notes that the people of Westeros consider the Targaryens closer to gods than men, but if they aspire to rule Westeros, House Targaryen must answer to the gods of its people. To that end, she has Jace and Luke swear on The Seven-Pointed Star that they will be only messengers, not warriors, and take part in no fighting. Rhaenyra tells Jace that Cregan Stark is closer to his age than hers, hoping that they can find some common ground as young men, while assuring Lucerys that the eternally proud Borros Baratheon will be honored to host a prince of the realm. With that, three dragons depart Dragonstone: Jace atop Vermax, bound for the Eyrie and Winterfell, Rhaenys on Meleys to the Gullet, and Luke on Arrax headed for Storm's End.
Concurrently, Daemon heads into the caverns beneath the Dragonmont, singing the High Valyrian song Hāros Bartossi. He enters the pitch darkness of a large cavern, from which a dragon growls, before with a gout of fire, the beast reveals itself: Vermithor, the dragon once ridden by King Jaehaerys I Targaryen, unclaimed since the Old King's death. Angered by the intruder in his lair, Vermithor snarls and advances on Daemon, but as the latter locks eyes with Vermithor and holds his ground, Vermithor becomes more subdued.
Storm's End
Prince Lucerys flies over Shipbreaker Bay and lands at Storm's End in the midst of a severe thunderstorm. A detachment of Baratheon guardsmen are waiting for him, as is Vhagar to his horror. Despite knowing her presence means Prince Aemond is present, Lucerys tells the Baratheon guards his purpose as Rhaenyra's emissary and is escorted to Lord Borros. In the great hall of Storm's End, Lucerys finds himself confronted with Lord Borros, his four daughters, and Aemond, who glares at his nephew silently. When Lucerys tells Borros he has brought a message from the Queen, Borros scoffs that King Aegon did the same, and asks if it is a king or queen who rules the House of the Dragon. Lucerys hands his message to one of the Baratheon guards who presents it to the illiterate Lord Borros, who is forced to call his maester to read it. Borros takes offense when the maester tells him that Rhaenyra means to remind him of his father's oath to support her, pointing out that the Greens at least offered him a marriage pact, betrothing Aemond to his daughter Floris in return for House Baratheon's support. Borros asks which of his daughters Lucerys will wed if he supports Rhaenyra, to which Lucerys admits that he is already betrothed to Rhaena.
Borros scornfully dismisses Lucerys for coming empty-handed, but before he can leave, Aemond, mocking Luke as "Lord Strong," demands Lucerys put out his own eye, as payment for the eye that Luke took from Aemond six years prior, claiming he intends to gift it to his mother. When Lucerys refuses, a furious Aemond draws a blade and charges at Aemond, intending to take it. Borros angrily gets to his feet, telling Aemond that Lucerys is an envoy and he will not have bloodshed underneath his roof, before ordering his guards to escort Luke back to his dragon. By the time Lucerys returns to Arrax, the storm is in full force, howling wind and heavy rain battering the pair as they take off, unaware that Aemond is following them on Vhagar with the intention of claiming his debt. Aemond suddenly attacks out of the clouds, using Vhagar to terrorize them, all the while cursing Luke in High Valyrian, but as the confrontation continues, Luke loses control of Arrax, who spits fire at Vhagar. The older dragon is enraged and disobeys Aemond's commands by killing Arrax and Luke in one bite. A horrified Aemond watches as Arrax's mangled remains fall from the sky, aware that his impulsiveness, rage, and lack of control have not only now made him a kinslayer, but ensured that Rhaenyra will never accept a peaceful resolution to the conflict, and guaranteed war will ensue.
As Rhaenyra holds another council with her lords on Dragonstone, Daemon approaches and whispers in her ear the news of Lucerys's death. Rhaenyra briefly staggers from grief, before turning to face her council with an expression of vengeful fury.

Behind the scenes
General
- This is the first episode in which Alicent Hightower, Criston Cole, and Harrold Westerling do not appear.
- The show follows the tradition of Game of Thrones, in which at least one king was killed off per season (except season 7). In this season, one king died: Viserys I.
On Dragonstone
- Daemon claims that Alicent murdered Viserys. According to Fire & Blood, no one ever claimed that Viserys was murdered, whether by Alicent or anyone else. Mushroom writes this, but since he is a very unreliable historian in general (according to the book, many of his fables partake more of a fool's fevered imaginings than of historical truth), this statement is questionable; he was not even in King's Landing when Viserys died.
- Daemon (in the book - Rhaenys) lists the seventeen dragons that they and their enemies have at disposal, dragons who used to have riders in the past, and wild dragons (he does not mention some of the dragons' names, which can be completed according to the book):
- The Greens: Dreamfyre, Vhagar, Sunfyre (the adult ones), and Tessarion.
- The Blacks: Syrax, Caraxes, Meleys, Vermax, Arrax, Tyraxes, and Moondancer.
- Unclaimed: Seasmoke, Vermithor, and Silverwing.
- Laenor Velaryon, King Jaehaerys I Targaryen, and Queen Alysanne Targaryen were the riders of these dragons respectively; after their deaths, no one replaced them till the beginning of the war.
- Wild dragons: Cannibal, Sheepstealer, and Grey Ghost.
- In the book, Rhaenys mentioned one more dragon - Stormcloud. However, Stormcloud's status is unclear. Given how Aegon the Younger is far younger at the outbreak of the Dance than his book counterpart, it's possible that Stormcloud is either a hatchling far too small to be ridden, or hasn't hatched yet.
- In addition to the aforementioned eighteen dragons, the book mentions two more (Morghul and Shrycox) that were alive at the beginning of the war, thus the total number of dragons at that point was twenty. A few more dragons were hatched during the war, but they were too young to be ridden and did not participate in the war; only one of those is mentioned by name - Morning.
- In the book, Rhaenyra pointed out that they actually had only five dragons against the Greens' four dragons, since: she was not strong enough to fly; the six riderless dragons were not claimed yet; Moondancer and Stormcloud were claimed but not ridden yet.
- Rhaenyra acts similarly to Daenerys in "Stormborn": she rejects the suggestions to send the dragons immediately to attack King's Landing, since she does not wish to kill innocent people, and states "I do not wish to rule over a kingdom of ash and bone" - similarly to Daenerys's words: "I am not here to be queen of the ashes."
- In the book, Rhaenyra never said those words; it was Lord Celtigar who urged her to fly against King's Landing at once, and reduce it to ash and bone. Corlys, Rhaenyra, and Daemon rejected his suggestion.
- It is the fourth time that "The Song of Ice and Fire" is mentioned in the show, following "The Heirs of the Dragon", "King of the Narrow Sea", and "The Lord of the Tides".
- It seems Corlys does not resent Daemon for killing Vaemond ("The Lord of the Tides"); maybe he recognizes that Viserys could not dismiss Vaemond's obnoxious behavior unpunished, or because Vaemond was in haste to bury Corlys and claim his seat, as Rhaenys says.
- Rhaenyra receives from Alicent the page Rhaenyra tore from Ten Thousand Ships in "The Heirs of the Dragon". Maybe Alicent meant to remind Rhaenya of the time they were friends, thus persuade her to resolve the conflict without bloodshed.
- If this was indeed Alicent's intention, she must have missed the irony: the passage in the torn page was about Nymeria, a formidable warrior, who consistently defied the patriarchal rules and customs of the world: she took over Dorne, survived invasions, uprisings, and assassination attempts, and was succeeded by her daughter - in contrast to the inheritance laws of other regions of Westeros, according to male heirs are ahead of female heirs. Thus the passage would encourage Rhaenyra to fight for the Iron Throne, rather than submit to her half-brother.
- The encounter at Dragonstone greatly resembles the encounter from "The Rogue Prince": the same place; the same leaders; Rhaenyra arrives riding Syrax; the event is resolved non-violently. The difference is that this time Rhaenyra sides with Daemon, and her impressive arrival is meant to discourage Otto and his retinue rather than discourage Daemon.
- Daemon acts in this episode consistently with his conduct in the previous episodes, quarrelsome and rash as ever. In the parallel book scene, however, he acted in a surprisingly restrained and staid manner, out of character for him: he agreed with his wife that they should try resolving the conflict with words before they went to battle, and first of all rally supporters. He rejected Lord Celtigar's suggestion to send the dragons to destroy King's Landing immediately, pointing out that their enemies had fearsome dragons which could kill their dragons, and he would not sacrifice them needlessly unless there was no alternative.
At Storm's End
- The deadly encounter between Aemond and Luke confirms what Viserys said in "The Heirs of the Dragon": "The idea that we control the dragons... is an illusion. They're a power man should never have trifled with." The Valyrian Dragonlords could control their dragons by using binding spells and magical horns, but the Targaryens who migrated to Westeros had neither.
- Daenerys realizes that in A Dance with Dragons (chapter 71, Daenerys X): Drogon allows her to ride on his back, but she cannot make him fly back to Meereen (also in the parallel scene of "Mother's Mercy").
- In "Two Swords": Drogon snaps at Daenerys when she tries to keep him from bullying a lamb off of his brothers. Jorah Mormont states "They're dragons, Khaleesi. They can never be tamed. Not even by their mother."
- The conclusion is that dragons are first and foremost wild animals that cannot be fully tamed, which is true for many animals in real life as well. Dragons are intelligent rather than mindless beasts and can form bonds with people enough to trust them and let them ride on their back, but even dragons bonded to and reared from birth are not 100% loyal or domesticated and are capable of ignoring or disobeying outright commands. Arrax and Vhagar both gave into their baser instincts when attacked or threatened, which even real-life domesticated animals will do, and the bonds their riders had with them were either insufficient to stop them or outright ignored.
- The scene at Storm's End resembles a scene form A Dance with Dragons (Chapter 19, Davos III): Davos arrives at the White Harbor, to persuade Lord Wyman Manderly to support Stannis; to his dismay, he finds out that envoys of House Frey are already there, and that Lord Manderly agreed to wed his granddaughters to Freys; Lord Manderly treats him with open hostility; the attending people taunt him; he reluctantly admits that Stannis has nothing to offer Lord Manderly, except avenging his son Wendel (who was murdered at the Red Wedding); one of the Freys threaten Davos and draws his sword, but Lord Manderly forbids him to spill blood at his court.
- In the following Davos's POV chapter, it is revealed Lord Manderly's hostility toward Davos was a pretence, to make the Freys and the spies in his court believe he is loyal to the Crown, but he actually wants to settle the score with those who are responsible for Wendel's death, and agrees to support Stannis (on condition that Davos finds Rickon Stark). It is unclear whether Lord Borros Baratheon acted genuinely, or he secretly supports the blacks.
- The confrontation between Lucerys and Aemond resembles that between Willem Blackwood and Jerrel Bracken in "King of the Narrow Sea": both confrontations take place at Storm's End, involve an older youth taunting the younger with insults such as "craven," involve the drawing of weapons (a sword for the younger and a dagger for the older), and result in death. However, the confrontation between Lucerys and Aemond never comes to blows inside Storm's End, and it's the younger boy that dies.
- By killing Luke, Aemond has become a kinslayer. Even if he did not intend to (in the book he did, and was proud of the killing) and lost control over his dragon - he initiated the encounter, thus it was his responsibility.
- Aemond's rash behavior in this episode slightly resembles Joffrey Baratheon's foolish decision to execute Eddard Stark: both ruined any chance to resolve the conflicts peacefully, and ignited extremely destructive wars which cost the lives of countless innocent people.
Altered and deleted scenes
- The following unused monologue was written for Rhaenyra: "Visenya. My only daughter, born an abomination. Mayhaps she is a warning from the gods. She is an augury. Born on the day my father died and my crown was stolen. I would have called her 'Visenya.' But she was not meant to be." David J. Peterson was commissioned to translate the monologue into High Valyrian.[1]
- A scene between Baela and Rhaenys in which the former insists on fighting for Rhaenyra. When Baela proclaims herself a dragonrider and says that the Greens must be answered with fire and blood, Rhaenys muses that she just saw her daughter Laena for the first time in years.[2]
- In the original storyboard, the final scene takes place in Dragonstone's throne room, with Rhaenyra sitting on the throne and Daemon approaching her to deliver the news of Luke's death. Rhaenyra then screams before looking into the camera, and Syrax emerges.[3]
- In the version that was filmed, another minute in which Daemon receives the news of Luke's death was cut.[4]

"The Rogue Prince" is the second episode of the first season of House of the Dragon. It is the second episode of the series overall. It premiered on August 28, 2022 on HBO and HBO Max. It was written by Ryan Condal and directed by Greg Yaitanes.
Premise
Rhaenyra oversteps at the Small Council. Viserys is urged to secure the succession through marriage. Daemon announces his intentions.
Synopsis
In the Stepstones
On a beach of one of the islands, Craghas Drahar, prince-admiral of the Triarchy forces, executes shipwrecked Westerosi sailors by nailing them to posts on the beach to either drown or be slowly eaten alive by the crabs drawn by the tide.
In the Crownlands
As King Viserys and his Small Council discuss the recent death of Ser Ryam Redwyne, Lord Corlys Velaryon furiously storms into the chamber, raging that the Triarchy forces have now sunk four Westerosi ships, including one from the Velaryon fleet, and demands action, insisting he be allowed to use the Royal Fleet to clear out the Stepstones. Ser Otto Hightower and Lord Lyman Beesbury argue against starting a war with the Free Cities, who are financing Drahar's occupation, while Viserys explains that he has sent envoys to the Triarchy's enemies in Pentos and Volantis with the prospect of an alliance against their common foe, but Corlys retorts that further inaction will only strengthen the belief in the Free Cities that Viserys is weak, as evidenced by the fact he has done nothing to end Daemon's illegal occupation of Dragonstone for almost half a year. Rhaenyra speaks up, suggesting that the Velaryon fleet, backed by Targaryen dragonriders, could easily reclaim the Stepstones (a suggestion that meets with Corlys's approval), but at Otto's urging, Viserys overrides her suggestion and dispatches her with Ser Harrold Westerling to consider the prospective replacements for Ser Ryam.
In Maegor's Holdfast, Rhaenyra watches as Ser Harrold presents various knights to take Ser Ryam's place on the Kingsguard. Rhaenyra is dismissive of most of them, asking Harrold if any have seen actual combat, rather than just tourney fighting. The sole candidate who has is Ser Criston Cole, who explains he has previously fought Dornish raiders; despite Otto's protests that a more politically valuable candidate should be chosen, Rhaenyra insists that she wants her father defended by a knight who can actually fight and picks Criston for the vacancy.
In his private chambers, Viserys talks with Alicent Hightower, while pondering over a model of Valyria, expressing his hopes to try and match old Valyria's glory. The conversation turns to Rhaenyra, with Viserys admitting his uncertainty of how to speak with Rhaenyra in the wake of her mother Aemma's death. Alicent advises Viserys to reach out to his daughter to bridge the gap (though she admits she hasn't mentioned her dalliances with Viserys to Rhaenyra for fear of her reaction). Alicent offers the same advice back to Rhaenyra when they go to pray at the Grand Sept.
Later that afternoon, in the Red Keep's gardens, Viserys meets with Corlys and his wife, Princess Rhaenys Targaryen; Viserys and Corlys exchange apologies over their terse words in the Small Council chamber, but Corlys repeats his advice of not allowing the Free Cities to think Viserys weak, firstly by striking back at the Stepstones, and by a marriage between Viserys and their daughter Laena, uniting House Targaryen's dragons and House Velaryon's fleet to prove the strength of his reign. Viserys is wary of a new marriage so soon after Aemma's death, but Rhaenys reminds him it will be expected of him to remarry and produce more heirs to strengthen his line. Rhaenyra reiterates the same advice and Grand Maester Mellos also supports the union, remarking that it would go a long way to healing the rift between Houses Targaryen and Velaryon left by the Great Council of 101 AC, though Otto seethes at Corlys's ambition.
The next day, Rhaenyra and Rhaenys watch from a balcony of the Red Keep, as Viserys walks with Laena. Viserys is visibly uncomfortable about potentially marrying a child, while Laena is more interested in hearing about Viserys's experience as the last rider of Balerion, as well as pondering the whereabouts of Vhagar. Rhaenys bluntly tells Rhaenyra that whoever her father takes as a wife, should Viserys have a son, the men of Westeros will expect that son to be his heir, not Rhaenyra. Rhaenys notes that given her own passing over, the men of Westeros will not accept a woman on the Iron Throne.
Later that evening, Viserys dines privately in Alicent's company, where she commiserates with him over his reluctance at wedding a new queen and gifts him a repaired model of a dragon for his miniature of Valyria. Otto interrupts the meal to inform the king that he has called an emergency meeting of the Small Council. One of the Dragonkeepers is present at the meeting, who informs Viserys that an egg has been stolen from the Dragonpit. The culprit is none other than Daemon, who left a missive announcing his intention to take his mistress Mysaria as his second wife, flippantly inviting his brother and council to attend, and as Mysaria is now with child, Daemon wishes to place a dragon egg in the infant's cradle in keeping with Targaryen tradition. Viserys, furious at this latest display of insolence by his younger brother, declares his intention to retake Dragonstone from Daemon, but Otto insists the king cannot risk himself, warning that Daemon is unpredictable and has fortified the island and castle with a private army of his gold cloaks, and volunteers himself to lead efforts to expel Daemon from Dragonstone. Rhaenyra is also left angry when she learns the egg Daemon had stolen was the one she had picked out for her little brother Baelon. Before departing for Dragonstone, Otto meets with Alicent in private and urges her to continue her liaisons with the king.
Ser Otto Hightower's forces, consisting of himself, Ser Harrold Westerling, Ser Criston Cole, and twenty of his household guard, arrive on Dragonstone. Daemon, accompanied by Mysaria and a detachment of his gold cloaks, intercept them on the bridge leading to the castle. Otto relays Viserys's demands that Daemon is to relinquish the stolen dragon egg and the castle, disband his private army, and banish Mysaria. Daemon refuses, insulting Otto and Criston in the process, insisting he is merely following his house's traditions. When Otto threatens Mysaria, Daemon draws Dark Sister, prompting both sides to draw their own weapons, though Otto orders his men to sheathe their weapons when Caraxes appears to defend his master.
Before the tension can spill into open conflict, Rhaenyra arrives unannounced on Syrax. She dismounts and brushes past a protesting Otto to confront Daemon personally. Rhaenyra dares her uncle to kill her if he truly wishes to reclaim his former status as her father's heir, but Daemon cannot bring himself to murder his niece in cold blood, even for his old position, and begrudgingly tosses Rhaenyra the dragon egg before retreating with Mysaria and his retinue back into the castle. Rhaenyra turns the egg over to the care of the Dragonkeepers.
Within the castle, Mysaria, who reveals she was not pregnant, Daemon having concocted the claim to spite his brother, berates Daemon for provoking Viserys, stating that while he enjoys a degree of protection as the king's younger brother, she does not and would likely end up the one who pays the price for Daemon's antics. Daemon assures Mysaria that he will protect her.
With Otto and his men having gone, Viserys meets with Lord Lyonel Strong for an impartial opinion about a prospective marriage to Laena Velaryon. Although Lyonel acknowledges Viserys's discomfort at marrying a child, he adds that strengthening an alliance with House Velaryon could temper Corlys's bitterness over the Great Council's decision, unify the last descendants of Valyria, and ensure the Crown has access to the Velaryon fleet should the situation in the Stepstones deteriorate into open war. The meeting is interrupted by Grand Maester Mellos informing Viserys of Rhaenyra's departure and return from Dragonstone.
The Kingsguard escort Rhaenyra to her father's chambers, where he angrily chides his daughter for taking off without his leave and risking her life, though he does concede that only she could have recovered the egg and ended the situation with Daemon bloodlessly. They speak about Aemma for a time, Viserys noting that Rhaenyra has inherited a lot from her, before reluctantly broaching the subject of a prospective remarriage. Viserys insists that he cannot replace Aemma, but with only Rhaenyra as his heir, were anything to happen to her, House Targaryen would come to an end, and though Viserys insists he will not replace Rhaenyra as his heir, even were his new wife to give him sons, he must ensure the continuation of their line.
At a Small Council meeting the next morning, Viserys declares his intention to marry Alicent Hightower. Only Otto looks pleased with the King's decision; the rest of the Small Council stand in silent shock, while Alicent averts her eyes from Rhaenyra. Furious at this latest insult to his family, Corlys storms out of the chamber. Rhaenyra follows him, disgusted and hurt by her father and friend keeping this from her.
Enraged at the snubbing of his daughter by Viserys, Corlys invites Daemon Targaryen to his castle High Tide. Corlys rages at Viserys's disregard and lack of respect for his family and loyal service, citing Daemon's own fall from Viserys's good graces as proof that they share a common cause, being men of action forced to make their own way in the world who have never received the due respect or appreciation for their efforts. Although Daemon chides Corlys for speaking disrespectfully of his brother, he is intrigued when Corlys proposes a joint expedition between them to eliminate the Crabfeeder, clear out the Triarchy forces from the Stepstones, and simultaneously claim wealth and glory for themselves, while proving their value to the dissenters at Viserys's court.

Quotes
Corlys Velaryon: I fear that the eyes of our enemies are presently fixed on the Red Keep. The Queen has passed. A girl has been named heir to the Iron Throne, the first in its history. The King's brother, so disinherited, has claimed the Targaryen seat on Dragonstone without challenge. And now, a foreign power has established a colony in our most critical shipping lane.
Viserys I Targaryen: You paint such an aspirant portrait of my reign, Lord Corlys.
Corlys Velaryon: To elude a storm, you can either sail into it or around it, but you must never await its coming.
Corlys Velaryon: With the Targaryen dragons and the Velaryon fleet bound in blood, you can show the realm that The Crown's strongest days are ahead... not behind.
Rhaenys Targaryen: Whether it's to my daughter or someone else's, your father will remarry sooner than late. His new wife will produce new heirs, and chances are better than not one of those will be male. And when that boy comes of age and your father has passed, the men of the realm will expect him to be heir, not you. Because that is the order of things.
Rhaenyra Targaryen: When I am Queen, I will create a new order.
Rhaenys Targaryen: How I wish that could be, Rhaenyra. But the men of the realm already had their opportunity to appoint a ruling Queen at the Great Council and they denied it.
Rhaenyra Targaryen: They denied you, Princess Rhaenys. "The Queen Who Never Was". But they bent the knee to me and called me heir to the throne.
Rhaenys Targaryen: Do you remind your father's men of that as you carry their cups? Here is the hard truth, which no one else has the heart to tell you. Men would sooner put the realm to the torch than see a woman ascend the Iron Throne.
Viserys I Targaryen: Ever since my name was read by the archmaesters at the Great Council, I have felt Corlys Velaryon's envious gaze staring at me from across the Blackwater.
Lyonel Strong: You sit upon the highest seat in the realm, Your Grace. Proud men don't like having to look up.
Corlys Velaryon: House Velaryon's origins reach back to Old Valyria. More ancient even than House Targaryen... according to some texts. But unlike the Targaryens, we were no dragonlords. For centuries, my house had to scratch out an existence from the sea with grit and luck. When I ascended the Driftwood Throne... I knew what I wanted. So I went out and seized it. Unlike every other lord of the realm, I can say that I built my house's high seat with the strength of mine own back. I've always thought of you and I as having been made from the same cloth.
Daemon Targaryen: I wasn't aware you had a King for a brother.
Corlys Velaryon: We're both men who have had to cut our own way through the world.
Corlys Velaryon: The Crabfeeder is backed by powerful entities within the Free Cities who wish to see Westeros weakened. And the King's failures have allowed him to accumulate strength. If those shipping lanes fall, my house will be crippled, and I will not have Driftmark beggared while our King idles himself with feasts and balls and tourneys!
Daemon Targaryen: I will speak of my brother as I wish. You will not.
Corlys Velaryon: Waiting in the Stepstones is a chance for you to prove your worth to any who might yet doubt it. We are the realm's second sons, Daemon. Our worth is not given. It must be made.
Behind the scenes
General
- The title of the episode derives from The Rogue Prince, or, A King's Brother - a slightly abridged version of the "Heirs of the Dragon" chapter in Fire & Blood, released as a stand-alone novelette in an anthology in 2014. The title of the novelette itself refers to Daemon Targaryen.
- After the cold open in the premiere episode at the Great Council, this episode introduces the new title sequence: it uses the same theme song as Game of Thrones (Ramin Djawadi has returned as music composer on this prequel), but instead of the camera moving through an animated astrolabe map of the world, it moves through an animated version of the model Viserys was building of Old Valyria's capital city.
- Viewership figures for this episode increased over the series premiere, from 9.98 million to 10.2 million in the United States across both HBO and HBO Max in the first 24 hour period (an increase of about 2%).[1]
- This is by a wide margin the shortest episode of House of the Dragon: Season 1, at 54 minutes. Seven out of ten Season 1 episodes are over 60 minutes long, and two others are 58 minutes long.
- This episode was originally meant to be directed by Miguel Sapochnik, and was viewed as the second half of a paired unit with the first episode (which he also directed). At the last minute, however, there was a scheduling conflict with the exterior locations for this episode, meaning that they had to film the scenes immediately or not at all. Sapochnik was already busy filming a different exterior location, which also could not be rescheduled, therefore he traded directing duties on this episode with Greg Yaitanes. In return, Sapochnik got to direct episode 7 - which Yaitanes mildly lamented, because he greatly looked forward to directing that episode. Somewhat making up for this, Yaitanes in return got to direct the season finale, as up until then they weren't sure if Sapochnik or Yaitanes would direct it. Sapochnik had already made full storyboards for episode 2, and Yaitanes tried to follow his vision for it as closely as possible.[2]
- It's possible that these scheduling issues and last minute change in director explain why it's the shortest episode of the season: it's possible more scenes were intended but weren't able to be filmed.
- There actually were at least two deleted scenes from this episode, but they might not have been fully completed in time for the final cut. See below.
- At the beginning of the episode, Rhaenyra is still wearing the triple-knot Valyrian steel necklace that Daemon gave her in the preceding episode. After she learns that he stole the dragon egg she had picked out for her dead brother Baelon, by the end of the episode she has stopped wearing it.
Deleted scenes
At least two scenes were deleted from this episode: photos exist of the cast in full costume for them, but the full scenes and post-production might not have been finished in time to include them in the final cut (due to the last minute switch for directors):
- An argument between Alicent and Rhaenyra in the godswood directly after Viserys announces his intention to marry Alicent.[3]
- Alicent Hightower was going to appear in an elaborate wedding dress. The wedding ceremony would not have been shown,[4] but a scene was filmed showing Rhaenyra helping Alicent into her dress, paralleling Alicent helping Rhaenyra dress for her ceremony in the previous episode.[5]
- Behind the scenes videos include a shot of Rhaenyra putting on Criston Cole's Kingsguard armor after he is appointed to the order, as part of a formal investiture ceremony.[6]
Filming locations
Filming locations for this episode included:
- The scenes in the royal gardens were filmed at the Jardines de Santa Clotide in Lloret de Mar, Catalonia, Spain.
- The brief scenes at the beginning and end of the episode in the Stepstones, previewing their full appearance next episode, were filmed on the southern coast of Cornwall, England.
- The Dragonstone exteriors actually did not return to the real life causeway on the coast of northern Spain which was used to film that location in Game of Thrones Seasons 7 and 8, even though production did return to Spain. As explained in behind the scenes videos, the camerawork they wanted to use in the scene would have been impossible on such a narrow causeway (i.e. overhead crane shots), so the entire sequence was filmed on the "Volume" virtual set at Leavesden Studios. The virtual set has 2,000 LED screens projecting the background and 92 motion capture cameras, and the actors could react in real time to images of the dragons instead of just pretending they were there.
- In the behind the scenes video for this episode, director Miguel Sapochnik explained that he wanted a totally new Small Council chamber for the new TV series instead of just recreating the old one (in-universe it's not supposed to be the same room, just a different one in the castle). Sapochnik said that one of his major requirements designing it was to add more space for the camera to move to film from any angle, and also large windows for better lighting.[7]
In King's Landing
- In the books, Ryam Redwyne died in 105 AC, the same year that Aemma Arryn died, and he was then replaced by Harrold Westerling as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, and Criston Cole was added to fill the open space as the seventh knight in the order. Harrold later died in the middle of Viserys's reign, in 112 AC. The TV series has expanded Harrold's role so that he lives beyond this (based on shots in the trailers that clearly show him alive at later events than he was in the books). The TV series altered the timeline to age up several younger characters: Queen Aemma died in the second year of Viserys's reign in the books (105 AC) but dies in the ninth year of his reign in the TV series. Viserys's reign apparently began in 103 AC in both versions (see below), meaning that the first episode begins in 112 AC (and this episode is slightly less than half a year later). Thus in the TV show, Harrold Westerling has become Lord Commander the same calendar year that he actually died in the books.
- Viserys tells Corlys that he has sent overtures to Pentos and Volantis to make common cause against the Triarchy, which is a triple-allaince between the Free Cities of Lys, Myr, and Tyrosh. Their enmity towards the Triarchy was stated in the books as well: Pentos borders them to the north, and Volantis to the east, and they felt threatened by the rise of this new power. The Triarchy was actually founded five years before the Great Council of 101 AC, and their first act was to use their newly combined forces to deal Volantis a crushing defeat at the Battle of the Borderland in 96 AC, allowing them to seize control over all of the Disputed Lands east towards the Rhoyne River.
- There may be some parallels between the delayed response to the Triarchy's attacks on the shipping lanes and Cersei Lannister's actions in A Feast for Crows (chapter 32, Cersei VII): as the ironborn, led by their new king, begin their campaign against the Reach, Loras and Margaery Tyrell urge Cersei to send the Redwyne Fleet (which at that point is besieging Dragonstone) against the invaders. Cersei refuses, since she secretly gloats over the Tyrells's distress, and fails to see that the ironborn pose a serious threat against the realm; by the time she finally orders Lord Paxter Redwyne to deal with the invaders, it is perhaps too late. Viserys is by no means as foolish and incompetent ruler as Cersei - but he is peaceful and prefers to resolve conflicts non-violently; moreover, he is strongly influenced by his Hand, Otto Hightower, who clearly has a political rivalry with the Velaryons (similarly to Cersei's enmity toward the Tyrells). Therefore it's unclear if Viserys isn't responding to Corlys's protests because he wants to avoid being dragged into a trade war, or perhaps because Otto is secretly in no great rush to stop these attacks on Velaryon ships.
- Another parallel to the novels: Corlys offered Viserys to marry his daughter Laena, but Viserys chose to marry Alicent, and by that offended and angered Corlys - which is slightly similar to the Mad King's refusal to Tywin's offer to wed Cersei to Rhaegar, which greatly offended Tywin, and was one of the reasons he resigned from his office as the King's Hand. While the lunatic Aerys's decision was based on envy and distrust, this may not be the case with Viserys, who was definitely not as lunatic and irrational as Aerys, and his decision was rational (House Hightower is a powerful family). Nevertheless, the outcome was similar, since Viserys's decision caused a rift between him and Corlys, even if Viserys did not mean to offend him.
- The showrunners and actor have said that they actually see Corlys as a parallel to Tywin: both are the richest man in Westeros in their own lifetimes, but the difference is that Corlys actually has a stable and loving relationship with his family. The Corlys' auditions even used Tywin lines as placeholder dialogue.[8]
- The assembled candidates for the position on the Kingsguard display the heraldry of, from left to right, House Caron, House Mallister, House Corbray, House Rowan, House Crakehall, then after Criston Cole is a knight from House Tarly. As they say in dialogue, House Cole is only a minor family of stewards in service to House Dondarrion, thus Criston doesn't even have his own squire to hold a banner displaying his heraldry. His shield did display House Cole's heraldry at the tournament in the previous episode.
- This marks the live-action debut of House Rowan heraldry: a golden tree on a silver background.
- Criston Cole says that he fought for a year in service to House Dondarrion, against a "Dornish incursion". As stated in dialogue in the previous episode, there hasn't been a major war in over sixty years. From the books, the Third and Fourth Dornish Wars happened during these years, but they were both small-scale skirmishes. The Third Dornish War happened almost fifty years ago and was against a minor bandit-lord, while the Fourth Dornish War was over 25 years ago, and lasted a single day - when a Dornish invasion fleet was destroyed from dragon-back (and thus no regular soldiers participated in it). That being said, the Dornish Marches experience constant low-level raids from minor Dornish lords and brigands hiding in the mountain passes, as at this point in time they're a hostaile border with the still-independent Principality of Dorne.
- Viserys states that at its height, Old Valyria possessed over 1,000 dragons. The books never gave an exact count, but the highest number provided so far is that the Valyrians were able to send 300 dragons to crush the Rhoynar (which resulted in Nymeria rallying the survivors to flee, as explained in the preceding episode). Another 600 years or so passed between the end of the Rhoynish Wars and the Doom of Valyria, however, and the number of dragons could indeed have tripled after the Valyrians defeated the Rhoynar and ruled over half the known world.
- The detail Viserys provides that the "blood-mages" in Valyria's capital worked in a special building called the "anogrion" is not from the books. Linguist David J. Peterson came up with the term as part of his expansion of the High Valyrian language. In his notes, he said that it means "temple" - though it is "an old word that derives from elder practices", so the literal etymology is "blood tower".[9]
- The subplot that the cut on Viserys's pinky finger is becoming badly infected is from the books, but began later in his reign. There is no specific mention of him being treated with maggot therapy, but in modern real-life medicine it is actually a widespread and trusted technique for removing necrotic flesh from a wound.
- Rhaenyra and Alicent pray at the statue of the Mother in the Grand Sept (Viserys stated the name in the preceding episode). The Great Sept of Baelor won't be built won't be built for another half-century. The Great Sept replaced an earlier one atop Visenya's Hill.
- Viserys light-heartedly tells Rhaenys she is his favorite cousin: he actually only had two first cousins, Rhaenys and his now-deceased wife Aemma. It's unclear if he's referring to more extended cousins or if he's making a joke (i.e. like saying to Daemon "you're my favorite brother" when he's his only brother).
- As Viserys explains, he only briefly flew Balerion before he died from old age. In the books, he only flew him exactly once: he circled King's Landing three times, and had intended to fly to Dragonstone, but realized the old dragon didn't have the strength anymore so he turned back. Balerion died only half a year later. This left Vhagar as the last of the original three dragons from the Targaryen Conquest.
- For the first time the prequel series has made passing mention of the Wall and the Iron Islands, when Viserys sarcastically asks if he should send his own brother to the Night's Watch or just execute him, and when Otto points out that House Mallister of Seagard are their main defenders against unsancioned raiders from the Iron islands.
- First mention of the dragon Dreamfyre, when it's said that the egg Daemon stole was the one of her's that was picked out for the dead baby Baelon. The book doesn't mention which dragon's egg it was. Dreamfyre is noted to have laid several clutches of eggs in the books, and it is somewhat implied that she might actually be the mother of Daenerys Targaryen's three dragons: in Fire & Blood, three dragon eggs are stolen and taken to the Free Cities, strongly indicating they eventually passed down to Daenerys, though the vague wording of the text makes it unclear if they specifically came from Dreamfyre. Thus this egg could be the sibling of Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion.
- Some of the High Valyrian dialogue by the Dragonkeeper Elder was cut. As scripted, after Viserys reacts, "Daemon?", the Elder goes on to say that "We were loathe to do him harm" and "He entered the Dragonpit under false pretense, then attacked both myself and my Acolyte. It will be some time before the boy recovers" - explaining how Daemon was able to take the egg despite the presence of fifty guards (and he didn't even need to attack two of them, because as a prince of royal blood they were afraid to strike him back).[10]
- The Dragonkeeper Elder says that Daemon stole the dragon egg "in the blackness of night...during the Hour of the Bat". In Westeros, each hour of the night has a customary name, and this is the first time this system has been mentioned in the TV series (they don't simply say "1 o'clock A.M." because they don't have clocks). Other than the general term that the "hour of the wolf" is in the darkest time of night, this system of hour names was only introduced in the fifth novel, A Dance With Dragons (2011), nor has a complete listing been given. The Hour of the Bat is followed by the Hour of the Eel, and the Hour of the Eel by the Hour of Ghosts. At some point later in the night is the Hour of the Owl, which is still quite some time before dawn, followed by the Hour of the Wolf, then the Hour of the Nightingale.
- Laena Velaryon is 12 years old in both the books and TV series when she's proposed as a new wife for Viserys - she wasn't aged-up like Rhaenyra was because it's a plot point that she was too young for Viserys to be comfortable with marrying her. A detail from the books is that Laena herself wasn't upset about Viserys rejecting the marriage pact, as it was noted that she was "more fond of flying than boys" (by that point she had already claimed a dragon for herself). Perhaps as a nod to this line, throughout her conversation with Viserys in the gardens she's mostly interested in discussing dragons and dragon-flight: asking Viserys what it was like flying Balerion, and excited to talk about sightings of Vhagar around Driftmark. When she has to talk about the actual marriage pact, she flatly recites a speech her parents prepared for her.
- Costume designer Jany Temime said that she intentionally "gave Laena the dress of a girl older than her age, to highlight the absurdity of the situation" - that this 12 year old is being put forward as a potential wife to a king who has a daughter older than she is.[11]
- Viserys says he intends to marry Alicent before the end of Spring - keeping in mind that seasons can last for years in their world. An exact list of seasons during Viserys's reign was not given in the books. What is known is that it was Summer in 99AC (two years before the Great Council), and later 120 AC was Spring, and that it was Autumn in 129 AC. If this episode indeed takes place in 112 AC (see below) that would mean the Summer of 99 AC ended, followed by an Autumn, Winter, and now Spring. Based on Tyrion Lannister's statement that he's lived through nine Winters, seasons generally average to about three years long, though the extremes can vary drastically (a ten year long Summer, like the one ending when at the start of Game of Thrones, is a once in a century event).
- In the books, Corlys Velaryon resigned in protest from the Small Council back in 92 AC, when his wife Rhaenys was first passed over as heir to the throne (about twenty years before this episode). In the TV series, he remains on the Small Council even after the Great Council of 101 AC passes over Rhaenys's claim to the throne a second time (allowing for face to face dialogue between him and the Small Council). Now it appears that he has resigned as well in the TV version, though this time he leaves the Small Council in protest over his daughter being spurned for a royal marriage pact.
On Dragonstone
The Dragonstone sequence is expanded from the book:
- In the book, Viserys didn't command Daemon to return to his wife in the Vale after the "heir for a day" incident, when he named Rhaenyra heir instead of him. Daemon was simply so frustrated by this that he retired to Dragonstone on his own, sulking there for half a year with Mysaria. He didn't attempt to fortify the island with his Gold Cloaks and didn't flippantly claim to still be the lawful heir.
- Mysaria actually was pregnant in the book, while in the TV show Daemon just claimed this as justification for marrying her (doing so essentially just to taunt his brother). Even though she did carry his child, Daemon never tried to marry her - giving her the dragon egg alone was enough to incur Viserys's wrath. In the book, after this incident Viserys ordered Mysaria to return to Lys, but she miscarried when her ship was caught in a violent storm. Given the narrative conceit that Fire & Blood is an in-universe history book, and Daemon publicly lied about Mysaria being pregnant, the implication is that the histories simply don't know this wasn't true.
- Daemon says he intends to take Mysaria as a second wife in Valyrian tradition: polygamy was not common among the Valyrians, but it was not unheard of either. Aegon the Conqueror himself was simultaneously married to both of his sisters. This was a major point of contention during the Faith Militant uprising: the main reason for the revolt was Targaryen incest marriage, but Maegor the Cruel went on to take multiple concurrent wives (he was the second and last of the Targaryen kings who had polygamous marriage). After the revolt ended the Targaryens had secured their privilege to continue with incest marriages, but no official status was secured for polygamy: simply, none of the subsequent Targaryens was ever brazen enough to antagonize the Faith again by testing this boundary. Daemon Blackfyre is rumored to have considered it, and it is implied that Rhaegar Targaryen took Lyanna Stark as a second wife (the "annulment" in the TV version would be impossible in the books, as Rhaegar had already produced children by his first wife, and also in view of the political applications of such deed).
- Daemon had another option: since his marriage to Rhea Royce was not consummated (Rhea says that in "We Light the Way"), according to the novels (A Storm of Swords, Tyrion IV) non-consummated marriage can be set aside, namely annulled; then Daemon would be free to wed Mysaria or any other woman. In Fire & Blood, Daemon did request that from Viserys as soon as he became the king (his request was denied) because he did not like Rhea, and that was before he met Mysaria.
- There is no mention of a dramatic confrontation like this in the books, between Daemon, Otto, and Rhaenyra. It simply says that Viserys commanded Daemon to stop, on pain of permanent exile from the royal court, and he grudgingly yielded up the dragon egg and sent Mysaria away. It was only at this point in the book version when Viserys outright commanded Daemon to return to his lawful wife Rhea Royce in the Vale, which he briefly does.
- All of this combined makes Daemon's actions in the TV version even more scandalous, but the end result is the same: he backs down and leaves the royal court in shame, but then makes common cause with the also-shunned Corlys Velaryon to seek his fortune fighting in the Stepstones.
Timeline
- It is directly stated that (a little less than) half a year has passed since the events of the preceding episode.
- It is directly stated that Rhaenyra Targaryen is 15 years old, and Laena Velaryon is 12 years old.
- In post-episode interviews with Insider, Ryan Condal and the two actresses confirmed that both Rhaenyra and Alicent are 14 years old in the first episode. Rhaenyra turned 15 years old during the six month gap between episodes 1 and 2.[12]
- Continuing from the first episode, in the books the story begins when Queen Aemma dies in the second year of Viserys's reign, but in the TV version it is the ninth year of his reign - adding seven extra years, much as Game of Thrones increased the amount of time since Robert's Rebellion at the beginning of the story from 15 years to 17 years. Given that only about six months have passed, this episode presumably also takes place in 112 AC.
- In the books, Rhaenyra was born in 97 AC - it appears this date was in this case retained in the TV show, as she would turn 15 years old in 112 AC (late 112 or early 113, factoring in the half year time skip by this episode).
- Laena and Alicent, meanwhile, were not aged-up relative to the moved start date of the story. In the books there's a nine year age gap between Rhaenyra and Alicent (though Alicent is said to look young for her age, and Rhaenyra old for her age). While an exact age hasn't been mentioned for TV-Alicent, she's apparently of comparable age to TV-Rhaenyra now, perhaps a year or two older - i.e. their nine year age gap was shortened by the seven added years to Rhaenyra's age, but not Alicent's Age.
- Laena was also 12 years old in the books when Queen Aemma died, and it was a plot point that she was so young that Viserys was uncomfortable even with a delayed betrothal to her. TV-Laena's birth date is 100 AC, when she was born in 93 AC in the books.
- This has wider implications for the changes to the Great Council of 101 AC: in the books, the final two candidates were actually Viserys and Rhaenys's son Laenor Velaryon, though it was broadly seen as a vote on Rhaenys's bloodline, and whether the inheritance could pass through a woman. Laenor is Laena's younger brother, in the books born a year later in 94 AC, and was only seven years old at the Great Council in the books - thus the explanation for the change in the TV continuity might be that Laenor simply hadn't been born yet at the time of the Great Council, but was born the year after it. In the first episode, when discussing who should be the official heir after Aemma's death, Corlys even stresses that she has a male heir - as in a male heir now, which she didn't have at the time of the Great Council.

Premise
As the families gather on Driftmark for a funeral, Viserys calls for an end to infighting and Alicent demands justice.
Synopsis
Laena's funeral
At Driftmark, King Viserys I Targaryen and his entire royal court attend the funeral of Laena Velaryon, along with the devastated members of House Velaryon. Laena's uncle Vaemond Velaryon delivers the eulogy in High Valyrian, in which he includes several pointed remarks about Velaryon blood remaining pure while glancing at Rhaenyra Targaryen's alleged sons with Laena's brother Laenor, who look nothing like him. While Laena's husband Daemon Targaryen is somber at her death, he cannot help but start giggling at Vaemond's pettiness in bringing this up now of all times. The ceremony ends with Laena's stone sarcophagus being dropped over a coastal cliff into the sea, to rest beside her ancestors.
The bereaved court then gathers at a cliffside courtyard of High Tide castle for the wake, which is filled with long awkward silences and strained conversations: this event has forced Rhaenyra and Alicent Hightower's families to meet in one place again right after Rhaenyra removed herself from King's Landing to Dragonstone, due to the (accurate) rumors after the birth of her boy Joffrey that all three of her sons are actually Harwin Strong's bastards. Moreover, Laena's death has spurred Daemon to return to Westeros for the first time in a decade, along with his daughters by Laena who have never met the rest of their family. Also gathered at the castle for the funeral are all of the dragons currently bonded to riders (which are big enough to mount): Daemon's Caraxes, Rhaenyra's Syrax, Laenor's Seasmoke, Rhaenys's Meleys, and also Aegon's Sunfyre and Helaena's Dreamfyre. Laena's Vhagar, apparently bereaved, rests elsewhere on the dunes of the beach.
Alicent and her supporters are the only ones who have gained from recent events: after Larys Strong secretly had his own father Lyonel Strong and his other brother Harwin killed in a fire, he has been made the new Lord of Harrenhal and Alicent's father Otto Hightower has returned to take Lyonel's place as Hand of the King. Alicent herself is disgusted with Larys's barely contained pride.
Rhaenyra's eldest son Jacaerys Velaryon is old enough to realize that Harwin was his father, and privately tells his mother how upsetting it is that they can't openly mourn him without drawing suspicion to themselves. Corlys Velaryon goes to Rhaenyra's second son Lucerys Velaryon and explains that because Jace will one day inherit the Iron Throne itself, Luke will one day inherit his own title as Lord of the Tides and head of House Velaryon. Luke tearfully says that he doesn't want it, because he would only become Lord of Driftmark after Laenor and Corlys were dead. Laena's traumatized daughters Baela and Rhaena Targaryen meet their grandmother Rhaenys for the first time and she consoles them. Rhaenyra tells Jace that despite their private loss of Harwin, he should go and comfort to his cousins. Jace walks over but no one knows what to say, so Baela and Jace just silently hold hands. Rhaenys glares at Jace and Luke, who she knows are not really her biological grandchildren. Laenor himself is stunned by his sister's tragic death, and has waded out into the surf on the beach below to be closer to her resting place. Corlys angrily tells Laenor's lover Qarl Correy to retrieve his "patron" from his embarrassing behavior.
Alicent's children are also present but detached from the events: Aegon is visibly bored and gets increasingly drunk on the wine being passed around while lecherously eyeing the serving girls. Helaena is infatuated with capturing a spider, while muttering cryptically to herself about "dragons of flesh" weaving threads of green and black. Aegon remarks to his younger brother Aemond that he is annoyed their mother recently announced he is betrothed to marry his sister Helaena (in incestuous Targaryen tradition), because he thinks she's an idiot. Alicent apparently announced this union right after declining Rhaenyra's suggestion to betroth Helaena to her son Jace. Aemond responds that if he was betrothed to Helaena he would fulfill his duty, and Aegon shouldn't insult his own future queen. Aemond is the only one of Alicent's family to show even a hint of sympathy for the Velaryon side of the family, when he briefly glances over at the grieving Baela and Jace and considers saying something, but he silently backs away.
King Viserys then goes to speak with his brother Daemon, whom he exiled for a second time a decade ago. Viserys still loves Daemon and asks him to return home to King's Landing, and let their prior differences stay in the past. Daemon says his home is Pentos, and that of his children. Viserys urges that there is still a place for Daemon at his side in the royal court and offers anything Daemon might need, but Daemon cuts him off. Not comfortably expressing grief, Daemon stammers out that he needs nothing and turns to leave. Otto Hightower, now restored as Hand of the King, offers token condolences as Daemon passes, but he just glares back and says that a leech's hunger is never satisfied. Throughout this, Rhaenyra eyes her uncle Daemon from across the courtyard, whom she was once infatuated with until he abruptly left ten years ago.
The skies begin to darken as dusk arrives and everyone begins to retire for the evening. Viserys is exhausted, and Laena's death in childbirth clearly reminds him of his first wife Aemma Arryn's similar death years before. With her on his mind, he accidentally says to Alicent, "I'm going to bed, Aemma," though Ser Harrold Westerling gently corrects him by asking "Shall I see after Queen Alicent, Your Grace?" - Alicent is quietly unnerved by this. Gathering all the children to leave, Aegon has passed out drunk in a stairway from all the wine he was drinking, so his grandfather Otto wakes him with a stiff kick and drags him to his feet.
Night on Driftmark
Alone in front of the fireplace that night, Corlys and Rhaenys have a tense discussion. Rhaenys complains that Laena wanted to return to Westeros to be with her family but Daemon opposed it, and wonders that if their own maesters had attended Laena's childbirth she might have survived. Corlys assures that the surgeons in Pentos are as well trained as they are at Driftmark, and she should not lay blame for an act of the gods. Rhaenys says she wonders if the gods are punishing them for their pride, and calls out Corlys for his attempts to put a Velaryon on the Iron Throne. Corlys says that as a loyal husband he wants to restore what was taken from Rhaenys at the Great Council of 101 AC, but she sharply observes it wasn't her rights but his own ambition which he wanted to fulfill. Not denying it but reflective, Corlys stares into the fireplace and gravely ponders what this brief mortal life is, if not the pursuit of legacy. Rhaenys then comes to the point: she wants rule of Driftmark to pass to Laena's elder daughter Baela instead of to Luke. Here in private she tells Corlys they should drop all pretense: they both know that Laenor isn't the real father of Rhaenyra's sons and that they are not of Velaryon blood. She doesn't care about the Iron Throne and is even open to Jace inheriting it someday (as it would still be through his mother, Rhaenyra), but she wants him to declare Baela heir to Driftmark instead of Luke while the royal court is still all gathered at their castle. Corlys says he can't bring himself to put a darker shadow over those innocent boys than there already is, as disinheriting Luke for Baela would immediately cast doubt on Jace's inheritance to the Iron Throne. Rhaenys says that Laena's daughters are her legacy and they must honor that, but Corlys says that history does not remember blood: it remembers names.
Outside the castle, Rhaenyra and Daemon take a moonlit walk along the beach, talking through their recent mutual losses and their tension at being apart for a decade. Rhaenyra worries that Laenor is so bereaved he will be useless to her now: they both knew their marriage was a farce, but at least she put effort into maintaining appearances. Rhaenyra explains that she and Laenor actually did try to conceive children several times, but to no avail, and thus she had three sons who (she is convinced) are all Harwin's. Rhaenyra worries that she should have forbidden Harwin from returning to the Riverlands, as she believes in the curse said to have been over Harrenhal since the Targaryen Conquest. Daemon scoffs that the alleged curse is just a superstition, that Otto or Alicent would gladly exploit, though Rhaenyra says she doesn't think Alicent herself is capable of cold-blooded murder (and indeed, she actually didn't order Harwin's death). Rhaenyra moves on to accuse Daemon of abandoning her for ten years, leaving when she was just a child and needed him. Daemon says he left because she was a child: he was sparing her from the dangers of being around him. Rhaenyra tells him to look at how her life played out without him, a droll tragedy. She asks if Daemon really loved Laena, and pained he says that they were happy enough, which Rhaenyra says is in and of itself a great achievement in this world. She says she is sorry for his loss, but he tells her he shouldn't be, because at least he is allowed to publicly mourn Laena in a way she can't publicly mourn Harwin. Consoling each other in their shared grief, Rhaenyra pulls Daemon closer and says she isn't a child anymore, and begins to kiss him. They take shelter in a nearby wrecked boat and disrobe each other by moonlight, and proceed to tenderly make love.
On a different part of the beach, young Aemond Targaryen has snuck out of the castle and found Laena's dragon Vhagar asleep in the dunes. Nearly the size of a sand dune herself, Vhagar is the oldest and largest living dragon, twice the size of even Caraxes and last of the original three dragons from the Targaryen Conquest. Aemond approaches cautiously and puts a hand on the rope netting leading to her saddle. Vhagar awakens but senses that he is a prince of Targaryen blood and backs down. Aemond puts his hand on the rope again and starts to actually try to mount Vhagar, however, at which she growls and starts building up fire in the back of her throat to immolate him with. Aemond bravely stands his ground, and like firmly giving commands to a horse, shouts verbal commands in High Valyrian for Vhagar to heel and obey. None can know the mind of a dragon, but after a mysterious moment she relents and allows him to climb to her saddle. He then gives her the order to fly, and she launches into the night sky. Aemond nearly falls off the saddle several times because he isn't properly secured but eventualy he manages to level out and master the flight, taking Vhagar on a circle around the castle before landing again, a bonded dragon-rider.
Baela and Rhaena, meanwhile, noticed that someone "stole" Vhagar and wake Jace and Luke to come and investigate. The four younger children intercept Aemond just as he is returning to the castle through the tunnel leading to the beach. Rhaena angrily says Vhagar was her mother's dragon and hers to claim, but Aemond says if she wanted her she should have claimed her already. Now filled with the boundless confidence of mastering not just any dragon but the largest in the world, Aemond says that if she wants a dragon of her own she can ask Rhaenyra's sons to give her a pig like they gave him, as it would suit her more. Rhaena charges Aemond but he easily shoves her aside, causing Baela to punch him in the face, and he quickly punches her back. A brawl breaks out between the children: Aemond punches Luke so hard he breaks his nose, but then the other children join in, and all four manage to pin Aemond to the ground, before he eventually brings his larger size to bear and breaks free. Bloodied, he stands and grabs Luke by the throat with one hand while holding a large rock in the other to strike him with, and declares he will feed them to his dragon, so the "bastards" can die in flames like their father did. Luke doesn't understand, saying his father is still alive, at which Aemond turns to Jace and remarks he doesn't know, and addresses him as "Lord Strong". Jace, who is old enough to understand, is so insulted that he draws a knife he had brought with him. He charges Aemond with it, but he manages to knock the blade from his hand and Jace to the ground. Turning his attention to the older boy and advancing on him with rock in hand, he doesn't notice Luke circling around to recover the discarded knife. Just before Aemond can bash him with the rock, Jace distracts him by flinging sand into his face, then Luke charges from the side uses the knife to slash Aemond across the left side of his face, through his left eye. Aemond is left screaming on the ground just as Ser Harrold and the other Kingsguard arrive.
Eye for an eye
The adults of House Targaryen are roused to the main Hall of Nine in the aftermath of the fight between the children. Viserys arrives and is furious with the Kingsguard for not protecting princes of the royal blood, to which Ser Criston protests they didn't expect to defend the princes from each other. Maester Kelvyn stitches up the horrific slash across Aemond's face and tells Alicent that his left eye is lost. Horrified, Alicent begins to panic and slaps Aegon for being drunk and asleep instead of defending his brother (even though Aemond snuck away in the middle of the night and no one knew where he was). Corlys and Rhaenys enter and demand to know what happened, followed by Rhaenyra who rushes to her more mildly injured sons. When she asks what happened, all of the children began talking over each other, Aemond saying the other children attacked him and the other children saying they were only defending themselves. Viserys shouts for silence, and Jace whispers to Rhaenyra that Aemond called them bastards.
Viserys asks Aemond to tell the truth of what happened, but Alicent angrily interjects that his son has been maimed and Rhaenyra's sons are responsible, and nothing else matters. Rhaenyra says Aemond's maiming was a regrettable accident, but Alicent says her sons brought a knife to the fight intending to kill Aemond, which Rhaenyra denies saying they only brought out the knife when they were forced to defend themselves. Rhaenyra says that Aemond made "vile insults" against her sons that they are bastards, and questioning their legitimacy is the highest of treasons. She demands that Aemond be "sharply questioned" to find out where he heard these slanders. Viserys asks where the boys' father Laenor is, to which Alicent snidely remarks that he must be "entertaining" his squires.
Viserys turns to Aemond and asks where he heard the accusation that Rhaenyra's sons are bastards, but after a tense moment looking towards his mother, he says that he heard it from his other brother Aegon. Viserys turns to his eldest son and asks where he himself heard this, but in a deft response, rather than blame his mother Aegon implores Viserys that "We know father. Everyone knows", and it is obvious from just looking at them. Distraught, with his voice breaking Viserys commands that they are one family and must cease this infighting. He orders them all to make their apologies and show good will to each other by command of their king.
After a pause, Alicent says this is insufficient, as apologies will not restore Aemond's eye - but the debt can still be paid by taking out the eye of one of Rhaenyra's sons. Viserys is aghast, but Alicent commands Criston Cole to bring her the eye of Lucerys. Enraged, she says that Luke can pick which eye he loses, which is more choice than he gave to her son. Criston hesitates, protesting his oath as her sworn shield and protector does not extend to maiming others of the royal family at her command. Viserys insists that the matter is finished, and from now onward anyone who dares to question the legitimacy of Rhaenyra's sons will have their tongue cut out.
Shaking with grief and fury, Alicent refuses to accept this: as Viserys turns to leave she pulls the Valyrian steel dagger from his belt and rushes across the room towards Luke. Just before she can reach him, however, Rhaenyra blocks her and grabs both her wrists. As they continue to grapple, the panicked onlookers circle up around them; Criston tries to support Alicent, only for Daemon to intercept him as Ser Harrold shouts at the other Kingsguard to hold the crowd back, including Hightower and Velaryon men-at-arms drawing their swords. Alicent shouts accusations at Rhaenyra which she has bottled up for years: she has only ever done what was expected of her, upholding her family and the law, while Rhaenyra was always free to do as she pleases (Alicent entered into an arranged marriage to a man old enough to be her father, while Rhaenyra blatantly had a love affair outside of marriage producing three obviously bastard sons). This is the last straw for Alicent, that now Rhaenyra can even have her son maim Alicent's son and once again face no repercussions. Alicent shouts that Rhaenyra has no sense of duty or sacrifice, even as Viserys and Otto demand she put down the blade. Rhaenyra coldly answers back that it must have been exhausting for Alicent to hide beneath the cloak of her own righteousness, but by attacking her like this, everyone now sees Alicent as she truly is. Alicent makes a final push to break free of her grip, and ends up slashing Rhaenyra along her left arm. Seeing the blood, even Alicent is horrified at how out of control the situation has become. She drops the dagger and starts coming to her senses. The room falls silent, then Aemond steps forward and despite the grievous injury to his face calmly tells his mother not to mourn him, for it was a fair exchange: he may have lost an eye, but he gained a dragon.
Later, Alicent's father Otto visits her in her private chamber. She is humiliated and ashamed by her attempted attack on Rhaenyra and her son, which now guarantees Viserys will always side with Rhaenyra over her. She fears for her reputation as well, as word must already be spreading that she has gone mad with grief. Otto is filled with pride, however, saying that they are playing an ugly game but up until this moment he didn't know if Alicent had the determination to win it. Otto says that young Aemond was correct, because winning the largest dragon in the world to their side was well worth the cost of his eye and the temporary damage to Alicent's reputation. He advises her to humble herself to Viserys and cite her grief as a mother for inflaming her passions, and in time he will forgive her because it is all he can bring himself to do. For now, they will bide their time.
The next day Viserys, Alicent, and their entourage leave on their ship back to King's Landing, while their children leave on the backs of their now three dragons: Aegon on Sunfyre, Helaena on Dreamfyre, and Aemond on Vhagar. Larys Strong approaches Alicent on the deck of the ship and offers that if she still seeks revenge for Aemond's eye, he can easily arrange some sort of assassination through his spy network. Alicent politely declines, saying that his help has not gone unnoticed and she will have need of it in the future, but now is the time for patience and discretion, which he accepts.
Removing Laenor
In Rhaenyra's chamber, Laenor arrives as Maester Kelvyn finishes stitching the slash on Rhaenyra's arm. Laenor is ashamed, saying that he has fought dreadful enemies in war but couldn't defend his own sister from death and could not defend Rhaenyra. She informs him that Aemond called their sons bastards. Laenor admits that he has failed Rhaenyra, that he tried to make their marriage work even though they both knew it was a sham, and that he truly loves their boys, but maybe he has not loved them enough. Rhaenyra says she did hope that the few times she and Laenor lay together it would have produced a child, and then things may have been different. Laenor says he hates the gods for making him as he is, but Rhaenyra gently insists that he is an honorable man with a good heart, a rare thing which he shouldn't be ashamed about. Laenor says that Ser Qarl is returning soon to the renewed fighting in the Stepstones, but he will not go with him: instead he will rededicate himself to Rhaenyra, to strengthening her claim to the throne and raising their sons as princes of the realm. He promises he will be the husband she deserves.
Rhaenyra then watches Viserys and Alicent's ship leave from the shore, while speaking to her uncle Daemon in High Valyrian. She has realized that conflict is now inevitable and says that she needs him to strengthen her side. He says that they could only marry if Laenor were dead, and she says she knows this.
Daemon then discretely meets with Laenor's lover Qarl Correy at the docks of Driftmark. He remarks to him that he is a lowborn knight with a lord's expensive tastes, but there are places across the sea where the name a man was born with doesn't matter, only how much gold he has. Qarl asks what Daemon wants in return, to which he says, "a quick death, one with witnesses".
Rhaenyra's conversation with Daemon continues: she does not want to be a tyrant and rule through terror, but he says tyrants only rule through terror. Daemon says that a king or queen must cultivate love and respect, but if they are not feared they are powerless. Rhaenyra says she does love Laenor, but Daemon says that if she loves him she will "set him free". She says their enemies will whisper she was responsible for Laenor's death, but Daemon says they want them to whisper: they can't prove anything and it will make her enemies fear what she and Daemon are capable of.
Back in High Tide castle, Daemon discretely sneaks up on one of the guards and snaps his neck. In the main hall, Qarl angrily approaches Laenor claiming he has always looked down on him, and draws his sword. Laenor draws his sword as well and they begin to fight in front of Laenor's frightened servant, who rushes out saying he will summon the guards. When the guards return along with Laenor's parents, they are horrified to find his corpse shoved head-first into the fireplace, horrifically burned beyond recognition. Rhaenys howls in anguish while Corlys furiously berates his guards for allowing such an atrocity to happen.
Rhaenyra and her uncle Daemon then marry each other in a Valyrian rite ceremony on the beach, a small gathering witnessed by their children and Maester Gerardys.
Late in the night, however, a cloaked figure runs to the beach on Driftmark where Qarl Correy is waiting for him with a rowboat: Laenor Velaryon, his head shaved so he won't be recognized for his Valyrian silver hair. Daemon and Qarl helped Laenor fake his death, swapping his clothes with the guard that Daemon killed and then burned. Rhaenyra and Daemon "set him free" from the arranged marriage he was trapped in, so Rhaenyra and Daemon could enter into a marriage alliance with each other, and Laenor could pursue the life he wanted with Qarl adventuring in the Stepstones.

Behind the scenes
General
- The title of the episode refers to Driftmark, the island seat of House Velaryon and where both High Tide and Castle Driftmark are located.
- This is the first episode of House of the Dragon to be titled after an ancestral seat of a Westerosi noble house; two episodes of Game of Thrones shared titles with house seats: "Dragonstone" (House Targaryen) and "Winterfell" (House Stark).
- Unlike several other episodes this season set entirely in or around King's Landing, this entire episode is set on Driftmark island (barring that the Rhaenyra/Daemon wedding briefly seen at the end might actually be on Dragonstone, but it isn't specified).
- Rhaenyra tells Daemon she needs his support, since she cannot face the Greens alone. This is the first time the Greens, the supporters of Alicent's son Aegon, have been identified by name. The opposing faction, the Blacks, have not been named on-screen yet. In the behind the scenes video for this episode, however, Emma D'Arcy (Rhaenyra) refers to them as "the Greens and the Blacks". Moreover, within the episode Helaena does make a cryptic prophetic reference to "dragons of flesh" (Targaryens) weaving threads of black and green.
- The books don't give any specific details about funeral practices for House Velaryon. The TV show invented that they inter their remains in a sarcophagus, which they then drop into the ocean off a specific cliff on Driftmark, so that they can rest in the sea with their ancestors. The Targaryens typically burn their dead, and because they were married to Targaryens it appears that both Laena and Laenor were cremated in the books.
- Vaemond's eulogy prominently mentions the Merling King, a local mythological figure in the lands around the Narrow Sea. According to legend, the Velaryons were given the Driftwood Throne as a gift from the Merling King. This figure isn't from the Valyrian religion at all but is a local deity that got mixed in with the Velaryons' cultural practices, being located out on the fringes of the Valyrian domains.
- Baela and Rhaena arrive at their mother's home Driftmark, and meet their grandparents Rhaenys and Corlys, for the first time in this episode. This is somewhat of a change from the books, in which Daemon and Laena actually moved back to Driftmark from Pentos about one year after the girls were born (who are twins in the book). Thus Baela and Rhaena spent more of their early lives on Driftmark in the books and already knew Rhaenyra's sons, while in the TV version Baela and Jace meet for the first time at the funeral and seem to bond over their shared grief.
- Rhaenyra remarks to both Daemon and Laenor that they actually did try to conceive a child together, but it never worked. Rhaenyra herself believes that Harwin Strong is the father of all of her children, but it is unknown if this is objectively true, as the possibility remains she could be mistaken. This was much more ambiguous in the books.
- Rhaenys insists that because Rhaenyra's sons aren't really Laenor's, Baela should be named the heir to Driftmark as the eldest daughter of Laena - ahead of Corlys's younger brother Vaemond (who is a nephew in the book). Most of Westeros (except Dorne) follow male-preference primogeniture, but it is still primogeniture: a lord's daughter inherits ahead of that lord's younger brother. Thus the daughter of Corlys's daughter should still stand ahead of Corlys's younger brother in line of succession. If this rule had been strictly applied to the new Targaryen dynasty, Rhaenys herself should have been named the heir of King Jaehaerys after the death of her father Aemon, who was the crown prince and eldest son. Instead she was passed over for Viserys, son of Jaehaerys's second son Baelon (Baela's namesake), on the pretext that he had unbroken male-line descent. Thus if Rhaenys was the rightful heir all along, and Laenor had no legitimate children, technically - even according to male-preference primogeniture - Baela would actually be the rightful heir to the Iron Throne.
- The wake scene presents a juxtaposition between Larys Strong and his secret nephew Lucerys: Alicent notes that Larys is almost gleaming with pride after recently becoming the new Lord of Harrenhal by secretly killing his own father and older brother. In contrast, when Corlys tells Luke that one day he will one day be ruler of Driftmark and House Velaryon, Luke says he doesn't want this at all, because he would only inherit rule after Corlys and Laenor are dead.
- When Daemon is naked in the beach scene, it can be seen that his back has several burn scars. This continues to show that Targaryens are not actually invulnerable to fire, as seen earlier when Daemon himself took a wound to the shoulder from a flaming arrow in the third episode. Game of Thrones made a change in Season 6 that Daenerys Targaryen was always invulnerable to fire, even though George R.R. Martin himself has repeatedly said that her survival of Drogo's funeral pyre when she hatched her dragon eggs was a one-time, miraculous event due to a magical spell.
- At the end of the episode, Viserys can be seen kissing a ring on his finger: it belonged to his wife Aemma Arryn, and has the Arryn falcon sigil on it. The death of Laena heavily reminds Viserys of Aemma's death, and she is so much on his mind that at one point he accidentally calls Alicent "Aemma".
- During the confrontation between Rhaenyra and Alicent at the climax of the episode, Alicent calls on Criston Cole as her sworn shield and personal protector. This is the only explanation given so far, even indirectly, for why Criston wasn't punished for killing Joffrey Lonmouth at Rhaenyra and Laenor's wedding, or even dismissed from the Kingsguard. It was somewhat implied that he retained his position due to Alicent's political influence, as the final shot of him in that episode showed Alicent intervening to prevent his suicide, and they had now both turned against Rhaenyra. In the book, Criston killed Joffrey during the tournament held to celebrate the wedding, and killing a man in a tourney is not considered murder. Immediately afterward, Criston became Alicent's sworn shield just as he once was for Rhaenyra.
Filming locations
- The filming location for the exteriors of High Tide castle on Driftmark are not CGI or a matte painting, but the famous castle of St Michael's Mount on the south coast of Cornwall, England. "High Tide" is so-called because it is a tidal island, with a land bridge connecting it to the main island at low tide which gets subsumed by the ocean when the tide rises. Rather than digitally add these elements, the production team simply found a castle that is actually located on a real-life tidal island which was willing to allow filming there. Extensive spy photos of Laena's funeral scene leaked out back when filming on the series began in May 2021. The scenes of Rhaenyra and Daemon alone on the beach, and Aemond finding Vhagar on a separate beach, were both filmed at Hollywell Beach on the north coast of Cornwall, about a 45 minute drive from St Michael's Mount.
- Greg Yaitanes originally intended to direct this episode, but was unable to due to scheduling issues. At the last minute, an on-location shoot for the second episode had to take place immediately: Miguel Sapochnik was supposed to direct it but was busy with a different shoot, so Yaitanes had to step in to film the second episode based on Sapochnik's storyboards. Yaitanes then swapped back directing duties on episode 7 to Sapochnik, though in return Yaitanes got to direct the season finale.[1]
- After the successful premiere of House of the Dragon resulted in its quick renewal by HBO, director Miguel Sapochnik announced that he would not be returning for work on Season 2. Co-showrunner Ryan Condal acknowledged in interviews that Sapochnik never intended to stay for a potential second season, citing his extreme exhaustion and need for a break, though neither of them ruled out Sapochnik returning to the franchise at some point in a later season. For now, this makes "Driftmark" the chronologically last episode that Sapochnik has directed for the franchise (though his final wrap was actually on filming one of the other two episodes he directed this season).
- The behind the scenes video explains that this was actually the first episode filmed during production on the first season, and indeed the first for the entire series as a whole. TV series are filmed out of order, and a cast will inevitably be less familiar with each other in their first episode compared to later in filming when they've had time to refine how they play off each other. Recognizing this, the showrunners decided to work with it: people at a funeral often don't know what to say to each other and would be expected to have awkward interactions, so they made the funeral episode the first one they filmed in order to mask the cast's unfamiliarity with each other when they began. For example, Matt Smith (Daemon) and Paddy Considine's (Viserys) interaction at the wake is awkwardly paced compared to conversations they later filmed for earlier episodes, but it fits that Daemon would be at a loss for words at his wife's funeral.
- It's stated in the behind the scenes video that the absolute first scene filmed for this episode, and thus the entire TV series, was the Laena funeral scene when her sarcophagus is dropped into the water. Almost the entire cast from both sides of the Targaryen family were gathered for it. The wake scenes then took four days to film after that.
- The sarcophagus was actually built out of fiberglass, not stone, so it was buoyant and could be recovered after each take. When the camera switches to an underwater position to show the sarcophagus sinking, it switches to a digital effect.
- It's stated in the behind the scenes video that the absolute first scene filmed for this episode, and thus the entire TV series, was the Laena funeral scene when her sarcophagus is dropped into the water. Almost the entire cast from both sides of the Targaryen family were gathered for it. The wake scenes then took four days to film after that.
- According to behind the scenes video, location filming at St Michael's Mount resulted in numerous logistical difficulties:[2]
- Due to its nature as a tidal island, materials could only be driven out to the site in a narrow window of the day. Most had to be sent weeks in advance, but they couldn't rush out to acquire new materials if an issue came up.
- The coastline of St Michael's Mount is almost entirely sheer cliffs (the beach scenes were filmed separately in northern Cornwall). Therefore, the platforms that the funeral and wake scenes take place on had to be built out by the production team. This was complicated by the fact that they couldn't legally drill into the rock of the island itself, but attach them with poles and straps - this meant that they could not build very large platforms. The entire wake scene contains about 40 people crammed into a small cliffside courtyard/platform, without enough space to fit the dolly or crane cameras: to change the elevation of the cameras they had to be propped up on ladders.
- As a tidal island, St Michael's Mount is of course famous for its rapidly changing tide levels - which presented a major challenge for scene continuity. It was also intermittently raining throughout the exterior shoot, even though it was supposed to take place on a bright sunny day. They had to wait for just the right hours to film when the sun was out and the tides were at the same level. Ultimately the funeral scene took a full day to film, and the wake scene took four days to film.
- Filming the relatively brief funeral scene was difficult, because it took 20 minutes to retrieve the sarcophagus from the water to reset for each take.
- Combined with the storms and tide levels, the surrounding bay is actually a major tourist area, which meant that they had to digitally remove tourist boats from the surrounding waters, as well as modern towns on the opposing coastline.
Aemond's fight
- In the books, Aemond actually got his right eye slashed out, but his left eye is slashed out in the TV series. This was possibly done for safety reasons: the adult actor playing Aemond is right-handed, and it would be more difficult for him to see where his sword is going if his right eye was covered.
- In the book, it is Rhaenyra's three sons who fight Aemond: Jace, Luke, and Joff - though Joff's contribution to the fight is minimal given that he was only three years old. Jace was six, Luke was five, and Aemond was ten years old. The TV series altered their ages slightly so that Jace and Luke are closer to nine and eight, but Joff is significantly younger and still just a baby. The TV version therefore swapped out Joff and added in the girls Baela and Rhaena (who were both around four when this happened in the books, but also older in the TV show). In both versions, Aemond is still about ten years old and thus the largest of all the children, so despite it being a four against one fight the strength of both sides is roughly even.
- This entire incident (in both the book and TV show) of the children of two rival families getting into a fight and the adults arguing over it in front of the king parallels how Arya Stark got into a fight with Joffrey Baratheon, which resulted in her direwolf biting him, and his mother Cersei Lannister demanding a punishment.
- There actually is an archaic law in Westeros that striking someone of royal blood is to be punished by amputation. Cersei demanded that Arya's hand be cut off for injuring Joffrey, but at the time Robert thought she was just being emotional and argued her into settling for killing a direwolf. Later in the fourth novel, when Cersei gets her own POV chapters it reveals that she was being completely serious, and even years later she still feels slighted that Arya's hand wasn't cut off as punishment. This also came up in the first Tales of Dunk and Egg prequel (90 years before the first novel, and about 90 years after this incident with Aemond), the central dilemma of which was that Dunk beat up Prince Aerion Targaryen because he was striking a commoner woman. Aerion insisted on the ancient law that Dunk should lose a hand or have his teeth knocked out as punishment, which Dunk avoided by asserting his right to a trial by combat.
- In "The Old Gods and the New", after slapping Joffrey, Tyrion indirectly refers to the aforementioned law by asking "Now I've struck a king. Did my hand fall from my wrist?".
- After Viserys forbids Alicent's demand for Luke's eye to be taken out in reprisal, the entire sequence in which the enraged and grief-stricken Alicent grabs his dagger to charge Luke and Rhaenyra is an invention of the TV series, not present in the book.
- The fight between Alicent and Rhaenyra is similar to Catelyn Stark's act of defending Bran from the catspaw assassin, who was armed with the same weapon; like Rhaenyra, Catelyn's hands were injured.
Dragons and riders
- This episode features the most dragons ever seen in a single shot so far in the franchise, with five shown perched on the cliffs next to High Tide castle between the funeral and the wake for Laena. Rhaenyra's Syrax and Daemon's Caraxes are flying overhead with a third dragon out of focus. Perched on the ground are two other dragons, one of which is the debut of Aegon's Sunfyre (but distant and out of focus). The dragon to the left of Sunfyre might be Laenor's Seasmoke or Helaena's Dreamfyre, and the third one in the sky might be Rhaenys's Meleys (all are the same "breed" of dragon with the same general body shape). Dreamfyre definitely does appear later, albeit in the distance, when Alicent's children leave Driftmark with three dragons. Vhagar isn't present during the wake scene but Aemond finds her later on the beach. Assuming that Dreamfyre wasn't in the wake shot but was on-screen when she left the island, a total of seven dragons appeared on-screen within the episode overall. In the book, historians accurately point out that this funeral was the largest gathering of dragons in a single place since the Doom of Valyria.
- This episode shows for the first time just how difficult it is to ride a dragon. Riders need chains to secure themselves to a saddle, otherwise they risk falling off when the dragon flies up or makes sharp turns. The task was difficult for Aemond, and even he wasn't totally inexperienced: as shown last episode, he's been present for lessons by the Dragonkeepers so he knows all the basics and verbal commands, and Vhagar has had previous riders so she knows how to respond. In contrast, all of this knowledge was lost by the time of Daenerys Targaryen, who basically had to figure this out through trial and error in the books, for freshly hatched dragons with no prior training. Daenerys only starts riding Drogon at the end of the fifth novel, an act of desperation to escape the fighting pits, so she doesn't have a saddle yet and finds it difficult to hold on. She also has to figure out a major difference between riding a horse and riding a dragon: horses are prey animals and will turn away from danger, so a rider must whip them on their left side to make them turn right; dragons, however, are predators, so if a rider whips them on their right side they will instinctively turn right, to attack whatever is harming them.
- An ongoing complaint in the later seasons of Game of Thrones is Daenerys never had a saddle, and seemed to be riding by just gripping the horns on her dragon's back for hours at a time, and never falling off even during quick turns. This was amplified when Jon Snow with even less experience or training managed to quickly bond with and ride Rhaegal, also despite not having a saddle and just holding on to the horns. The books do strongly imply that riding a dragon isn't merely like riding a horse, but some form of low-level psychic bond, so it is possible that Daenerys and Jon managed to ride them so well due to their strong Targaryen bloodlines - but the original TV show never introduced the psychic bond as an explanation.
- When Vhagar first flies vertically, Aemond nearly falls off because he wasn't secured properly, and is left dangling from the reins until Vhagar levels off. The behind the scenes video reveals that this was not a digital effect: the dragon-riding rig was hung vertically, and actor Leo Ashton was actually hanging from the reins (though he was secured with safety lines that were later removed digitally). Ashton filmed these scenes on the virtual set six months after he filmed his corresponding scenes on Hollywell Beach in Cornwall, so the production team had to make sure to hide how much he'd grown (through makeup, costume, having his hair hide his face in some shots, etc.)
- Aemond gives Vhagar several verbal commands in High Valyrian: this detail isn't in the books, but the TV series established that the dragons are trained to follow multiple different commands in it. Daenerys only taught her dragons that "dracarys" means "dragon-fire". When Aemond first approaches Vhagar he says "dohaerās!" - which means "serve!" (in the sense of "obey!"), and then "lykirī!" - which means "be calm!" / "calm!" / "heel". When Aemond then urges Vhagar to take off, he says "sōvēs!" - which means "fly!". When Daenerys first ordered her dragon to fly at the end of Game of Thrones Season 5 she told him to "ride!" in Dothraki ("valahd!"), not Valyrian, due to a mix-up on set that day.
- In the behind the scenes video, the production staff says that the TV version of Vhagar is about 150 meters long (slightly less than 500 feet).
Helaena and prophecy
- As hinted at in the preceding episode, Helaena Targaryen has strongly inherited her family bloodline's propensity towards having prophetic visions or dreams (known as "dragon dreams" in the books, because dragons are often present in them). Helaena isn't described like this in Fire & Blood, though as an in-universe history book it wouldn't cover such specific details.
- In the preceding episode, when Alicent assured Aemond that he would have a dragon someday, Helaena cryptically remarked, "He'll have to close an eye", which is exactly what happens in this episode when he loses an eye in the process of claiming Vhagar.
- As explained in the first episode, Aegon the Conqueror (grandfather of Viserys's grandfather) secretly had a prophetic dream about the return of the White Walkers, and generations before him the Targaryens survived the Doom of Valyria because Daenys had a prophetic dream of impending destruction. Helaena's own father Viserys had a prophetic dream of a son being born to him who wore the crown of Aegon the Conqueror, and though it greatly influenced him he said in the third episode that this is the only prophetic dream he ever had, and he only had it once in his entire life. Several other Targaryens have prophetic dreams throughout the books, such as Daenerys, Jon Snow, and Maester Aemon's older brother Daeron.
Laenor's fate
- In Fire & Blood, Laenor Velaryon's death is not faked - this is a major departure from the source material. The book is framed as an in-universe history book, so by definition if a character successfully faked their own death the history books would not record it. George R.R. Martin is also fond of plot twists in which characters fake their own deaths or are reported to be dead only to reappear alive later (for instance, Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell), Davos Seaworth, and Mance Rayder). This seems unlikely, however, in this specific case: in the book Laenor was stabbed to death in the middle of a market, and no mention is made that the corpse was burned beyond recognition.
- Qarl Correy's motivation and fate are unknown in the book, as this is another "unreliable narrator" moment between the three main historical sources: Munkun merely says Laenor died in a fight with a household knight, while Eustace gives the knight's name and says that it was a lover's quarrel. The ribald court jester Mushroom alleges that Daemon bribed Qarl to kill Laenor, so that he could marry Rhaenyra. Mushroom also claims that Daemon had a ship waiting for Qarl off-shore - but as soon as they were out at sea, Daemon killed him and dumped his body overboard, to destroy all evidence of the crime. The main historian writing Fire & Blood, Gyldayn, notes that this is one of the rare points in which Mushroom's typically preposterous version of events actually seems quite plausible.
- Laenor's departure does raise the issue of what will happen to his dragon, Seasmoke. Dragons have a powerful homing instinct to find their bonded rider, even when they are hundreds of miles away. Moreover, dragons only bond with a single rider at a time and this apparently psychic bond is only broken when their current rider dies. Another character during the coming succession crisis eventually bonds with Seasmoke. This raises three possibilities:
- 1 - Laenor simply died off-screen in the six-year time skip between this and the next episode, the warrior's death in battle he always wanted (much like Laena).
- 2 - The TV series will simply ignore this rule.
- 3 - No mention will be made of Laenor actually dying, but some sort of explanation will be introduced to at least address it (i.e. that Laenor has been gone for so long that their bond weakened, or that a dragon can rarely bond to a second rider).
Rhaenyra and Daemon's wedding
- Rhaenyra and Daemon marry each other in a traditional Valyrian rite wedding ceremony. While the old Valyrian religion did presumably have its own wedding ceremony, it is only mentioned once in the books when it is said that Maegor the Cruel wed his second wife in Valyrian rites, because it was a polygamous marriage (polygamy was uncommon but permitted in the Valyrian religion). No septon could be found who would marry them in the rites of the Faith of the Seven, so Maegor's own mother Visenya officiated the Valyrian wedding ceremony. Even so, the exact details of the ceremony aren't described in any detail.
- Recognizing that no details on what Valyrian wedding ceremonies are like were given in the books, Ryan Condal said:
- "The writers took what material we had, knowing what we know about Old Valyria, knowing that any kind of marriage ceremony would probably be quite primal. So one of our writers wrote vows, which we gave off to David J. Peterson our Valyrian translator, to translate into High Valyrian, and we turned it all into a ceremonial Valyrian wedding."[3]
- Costume designer Jany Temime put a great deal of thought into the designs for Rhaenyra and Daemon in this scene, because wedding clothes are ceremonial, which means they are usually a glimpse into archaic fashions - an echo of what ancient Valyrian designs looked like thousands of years ago. She decided to base them on the ceremonial robes that the Dragonkeepers wear, but much more ornate:
- "That was actually one of the most difficult costumes. I couldn't do more than what I had done before for the different wedding (in episode 5), so I thought it would be a good approach to do something completely different. We thought, 'What about going in the direction of the dragonkeeper?' Something very simple, very kimono-like, which seemed to have been created before the Targaryens. I wanted the red blood-elements in it. We had to create the tie-dye, going from red into the purity of white, and that was a lot of work."[4]
- Rhaenyra tells Daemon "Let us bind our blood, just as Aegon the Conqueror did with his sisters" - referring to the Targaryen custom of marrying family relatives, not to the aspect of polygamy (since both of them are currently unmarried).
- When Daemon asked Viserys to wed Rhaenyra ("King of the Narrow Sea") he also mentioned Aegon the Conqueror, but that was a reference to the polygamy aspect of Aegon's marriage (Daemon was still married then).
- The book makes no mention of Rhaenyra having sex with Daemon before they were married, though several accuse that they did. In the TV version they only have sex once after Laena's funeral, and Rhaenyra's marriage to Laenor was always an open one. There is also a fan theory that it is may be implied Rhaenyra was herself attracted to Laena. Septon Eustace, the source biased against Rhaenyra, said that she and Daemon married so quickly after Laenor's death (only six months later). Mushroom's ribald account claims that they married because Rhaenyra discovered she was pregnant and she did not wish to give birth to another bastard. One way or another, Rhaenyra did become pregnant around the time they were married, and at the end of the same calendar year in which Laena and Laenor died, Rhaenya and Daemon's first son was born.
Altered and deleted scenes
- The scene in which the Green dragons fly back to King's Landing was storyboarded to include Dreamfyre and Sunfyre in the foreground, taking off from the cliff like Vhagar. The final version has only Vhagar in the foreground, with Dreamfyre and Sunfyre already flying in the distance.[5]

Three years have passed since King Viserys's marriage to Alicent Hightower, in which time Queen Alicent has given birth to a son, Prince Aegon. The royal court is preparing to depart for a grand hunt in the Kingswood, with Viserys excited to leave the politics of court behind even as his new Master of Ships, Ser Tyland Lannister, badgers him about the prospect of Prince Daemon and Lord Corlys being defeated in the Stepstones. Ser Otto Hightower dismisses Tyland's concerns, insisting that Daemon and Corlys's military campaign was commenced without the king's blessing and that to send aid to them now would make the Crown look weak, while Viserys is more concerned about the notable absence of his daughter. Alicent finds Princess Rhaenyra brooding in the Red Keep's godswood; Alicent tries to make friendly overtures to her old friend turned stepdaughter, but Rhaenyra is disinclined to listen and storms out. In private, Otto's elder brother, Lord Hobert Hightower, urges his brother to encourage Viserys, now that Aegon's infancy is over, to name the boy as heir apparent to the Iron Throne, in keeping with Westerosi tradition.
The royal family travels to the Kingswood in a closed wheelhouse; Rhaenyra expresses surprise the heavily pregnant Alicent is accompanying them, though she replies that the maester assured her being out in the fresh air will do her good. Rhaenyra is left discomforted when Viserys expresses hope she will soon marry and make him a grandfather. The mood grows further tense when Viserys insists she should accompany him on the hunt in her capacity as his heir, as he claims she has been shirking her duties as princess; Rhaenyra scoffs at the idea, insisting that none of the nobles present at this hunt are here for her, a conclusion that is only strengthened upon their arrival at the royal hunting encampment, where Lord Hobert leads the cheering for the infant Aegon, hailing the boy as the "Second of His Name", making it clear to Rhaenyra at least some of the realm's nobility consider Aegon, not her, Viserys's heir.
Within the royal pavilion, after enduring the conversations of the noble ladies present and growing angry at their denigration of Daemon's campaign in the Stepstones, Rhaenyra exits the pavilion only to be approached by Lord Jason Lannister, who plies her with honeyed wine made in Lannisport and waxes lyrical about the privileges offered by Casterly Rock. Rhaenyra is confused when Lord Jason admits he does not possess a Dragonpit but does have the means to build one; when Rhaenyra questions why he would need such a thing, Jason replies he would build one to satisfy his Queen...or his lady wife. Realizing that Lord Jason is trying to make a marriage proposal to her, Rhaenyra takes her leave and storms back into the royal pavilion to remonstrate with Viserys.
When she confronts her father, Viserys insists Lord Jason's proposal is merely the latest in a long list of offers for her hand he's been receiving since she came of age, and Rhaenyra has snubbed every effort Viserys has made to engage her in the discussion. Rhaenyra protests she has no interest in marriage, to which Viserys angrily rages that he was expected to marry again for tradition and duty, so she is no different. Before the argument gets more vicious, Otto interrupts with a report that a white hart has been sighted by the Royal Huntsman, insisting catching and killing such a creature, hailed in local lore as the "King of the Kingswood" would surely be an auspicious portent on Prince Aegon' nameday. Before departing with Otto, Viserys insists Rhaenyra will marry.
Furious and hurt, Rhaenyra storms out of the pavilion, mounts a horse and flees the encampment; Ser Criston Cole sees her doing so and mounts up to follow Rhaenyra in his capacity as her sworn shield. Rhaenyra races through the Kingswood with Criston in close pursuit, begging her to stop, before finally catching her on the shores of a small lake. Rhaenyra bitterly laments her father trying to marry her off to Jason Lannister, though she is briefly cheered up when Criston jokingly offers to kill him. Criston urges they return to camp, but Rhaenyra suggests they explore the Kingswood for a while, as she has no desire to return yet. As they walk through the forest, Rhaenyra asks Criston if he was betrothed; he replies that his status as the son of Lord Dondarrion's steward would have allowed him to wed a common girl, but there was never any he had his eye on. Rhaenyra confesses to being envious of his freedom, lamenting that despite being named her father's heir, she wields no real power and authority, being little more than a figurehead. Criston counsels her otherwise, reminding Rhaenyra that she was the one who raised him to the Kingsguard, the highest honor that anyone from House Cole has ever received.
Back at the royal pavilion, as Viserys gets drunk and waits for reports from the Royal Huntsman the white hart has been tracked down, Lord Jason Lannister approaches the king and tries to press his suit for Rhaenyra's hand. Unfortunately, his comment that as Lady of Casterly Rock, Rhaenyra will be well compensated for her loss in station as Viserys's heir angers the king at the assumption he intends to replace Rhaenyra as his heir. When Lord Jason admits there has been idle talk amongst some of the lords regarding the suggestion, Viserys angrily accuses Jason of allowing treasonous talk to foment amongst his bannermen and dismisses him. Viserys is further exasperated when Otto approaches him, suggesting an alternative betrothal for Rhaenyra: Prince Aegon (in a transparent attempt to move his grandson closer to the Iron Throne). Viserys laughs incredulously at the notion, insisting the boy is only two years old. Otto suggests it would put an end to further suits from the nobility for Rhaenyra's hand and the bother this has caused Viserys, but Viserys dismisses the matter out of hand, along with Otto, and sinks deeper into his cups.
Later in the evening, he engages his Master of Laws, Lord Lyonel Strong in conversation, lamenting that despite being Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, he is unable to control his seventeen year old daughter. Lord Lyonel jokingly suggests it might be a Targaryen family tradition, given that while Viserys's grandfather, King Jaehaerys I Targaryen, ruled over half a century of peace, he was driven near to madness by the antics of his children, particularly his daughters, eliciting some amusement from Viserys. Lyonel asks if the King wishes his advice on the matter; Viserys irritably assumes Lyonel means to put forward his own son Ser Harwin Strong as a candidate for Rhaenyra's hand, but Lyonel instead advocates the best choice for Rhaenyra might be a marriage to Ser Laenor Velaryon; as the Sea Snake's son, he is heir to the wealthiest House in Westeros, of pure Valyrian descent with Targaryen blood from his mother, Princess Rhaenys Targaryen, and such a marriage would help heal the rift between Houses Targaryen and Velaryon, only made worse by Viserys spurning Laenor's sister, Laena Velaryon in favor of Alicent. Though Lyonel does note the proposal depends on Laenor surviving his father's campaign in the Stepstones, Viserys clearly gives the matter considered thought.
Out in the Kingswood, Rhaenyra and Criston make camp for the night. Rhaenyra asks Criston if he believes the realm will accept her as Queen; Criston demurs and insists they will have no choice but to. A rustling in the foliage nearby disturbs them; when Criston draws his sword and goes to investigate, a wild boar charges out of the bushes, trampling Criston and attacking Rhaenyra before Criston and Rhaenyra overpower and kill the animal, Rhaenyra delivering the killing blow in a wrathful frenzy. Back at the royal encampment, a heavily drunk Viserys laments to Alicent his fears he made a mistake naming Rhaenyra his heir; his obsessive pursuit of the prophetic vision he had, of a son born to him wearing Aegon the Conqueror's crown, resulted in Viserys losing Queen Aemma and becoming estranged from Rhaenyra. He'd hoped naming Rhaenyra as his heir might begin to repair the damage his obsession caused, both to his family and to the realm, but despite Alicent's reassurances, a tearful Viserys wonders, now he has a son born to him, was he wrong to put Rhaenyra first.
The next morning, Viserys and his courtiers accompany the Royal Huntsman to a clearing in the godswood; unable to track down the white hart, they have caught a large stag for Viserys to kill instead. Using a spear borrowed from Lord Jason, it takes a conflicted Viserys two strikes to slay the animal. Elsewhere in the kingswood, a dishevelled and bloodstained Rhaenyra and Criston encounter the white hart; Rhaenyra merely admires the animal before letting it go unharmed and returning to the royal encampment with the boar's carcass.
Back at the Red Keep, Otto and Alicent share a private conversation: Otto insists Alicent urge Viserys to name Aegon as his heir, claiming letting Rhaenyra pass over him to ascend the Iron Throne would incite chaos. Alicent reminds her father that the nobility of the realm, including House Hightower, swore obeisance to Rhaenyra as Viserys' heir and that she will not raise her son to steal his sister's birthright. Otto retorts that Aegon is the one being robbed, as by tradition and precedent, as Viserys' son, he is his father's rightful heir, and the next King of Westeros. Later that evening, Alicent goes to speak with Viserys, who reveals he has received a petition from Ser Vaemond Velaryon, requesting reinforcements in the Stepstones, as well as frustratedly insisting that Rhaenyra needs a husband of suitable rank to support her and rule by her side as King-Consort, regardless of her personal feelings on the matter. Alicent urges Viserys to give Rhaenyra at least the belief she can choose her own husband, as well as sending reinforcements to the Stepstones, since it is better for Westeros that the Velaryons and Daemon, rather than the Crabfeeder, are victorious.
The next morning, Viserys summons Rhaenyra to the Small Council chamber. He reveals his intention to send reinforcements to Daemon; Viserys refuses to let his younger brother die out of pride. He asks Rhaenyra's thoughts on the matter, to which she retorts he and his Small Council have made it frequently clear her thoughts on matters of governance are immaterial, prompting Viserys to exasperatedly ask if his daughter intends to become as much a thorn in his side as his brother. He apologizes for trying to foist Jason Lannister on her, insisting that he only wanted to help Rhaenyra by providing her House Lannister's wealth and power through marriage; Rhaenyra scoffs that in her mind, it was her father making a pretty transparent effort to get her out of the way so he could replace her. Viserys insists he is not trying to replace Rhaenyra, but reminds her, even though his marriage to her mother became a happy one, it was originally arranged for political gain, as have most royal marriages in Westerosi history. Viserys urges Rhaenyra to pick a husband, both so she can have the happiness of starting a family of her own and build support for her claim to the Iron Throne with her husband's family, but insists he will allow her to choose her own consort.
In the Stepstones
It has been three years since Lord Corlys Velaryon and Prince Daemon Targaryen led an invasion fleet to the Stepstones to put an end to the depredations of Craghas Drahar. On the beach of Bloodstone, as Drahar amuses himself by executing prisoners while his men loot the wreckage of a Velaryon ship, Daemon descends atop Caraxes, the dragon's fire incinerating many of the Triarchy's soldiers on the beach, while the rest retreat with Drahar into the island's caverns where Caraxes cannot pursue. Volleys of arrows from Triarchy archers on the cliffs overlooking the beach force Daemon and Caraxes to retreat.
Several weeks later, at the Velaryon camp on Dwarfstone, Corlys, along with his son Laenor and brother Vaemond discuss their situation as Daemon returns from another dragonborne sortie against Drahar's stronghold. Corlys lists that their supplies are about to run out, the men are demoralized, and ships bound to resupply them from Driftmark are still weeks away. Laenor proposes a desperate gambit, using Daemon as bait to lure the Crabfeeder's forces into the open to eliminate them all at once, despite his uncle's misgivings. The war council is interrupted by the arrival of Ser Addam, a messenger from King's Landing sent by Viserys, promising his brother reinforcements. Furious at the notion of being bailed out by his older brother, Daemon furiously attacks the messenger, beating him with his helmet before the Velaryons intervene. Daemon later departs for Bloodstone alone in a rowing boat.
Fashioning a white flag from the wreckage of previous battles on Bloodstone, Daemon goes to one knee, holding out Dark Sister in a gesture of surrender. When one of Drahar's soldiers moves to take the sword, Daemon stabs him with a dagger, recovers Dark Sister, and cuts down any man standing between himself and Drahar. The Triarchy archers bring Daemon down short of his goal, but as Triarchy soldiers move in to finish him off, they are set ablaze by Laenor Velaryon astride his own dragon Seasmoke, who then wipes out the Triarchy archers overlooking the battlefield. As the Triarchy forces reel, Corlys and Vaemond lead a brutal counterattack against the enemy, while Daemon pursues Drahar into the caves. As the Velaryon forces claim victory, a blood-stained Daemon emerges, dragging the upper half of Drahar's bisected corpse behind him.

Behind the scenes
General
- The title of this episode refers to Prince Aegon Targaryen, specifically Hobert Hightower proclaiming him "Aegon the Conqueror-babe, Second of His Name." It may also be a nod to the similarly titled Game of Thrones: Season 4 episode "First of His Name."
- There is a three year time skip between "The Rogue Prince" and this episode. It's stated in dialogue that three years have passed, and that Rhaenyra is now 17 years old (give or take a few months from her nameday, as she was 15 in "The Rogue Prince"). As Ryan Condal points out in the Inside the Episode, this is the first significant time skip of Season 1, albeit somewhat small compared to others that will come. The six month time skip between episodes 1 and 2 wasn't significant because no one was recast. This three year time skip, however, now introduces baby Aegon, and Laenor Velaryon has been recast (though the child version of Laenor only appeared in the first episode and never had speaking lines). As the season progresses, even Rhaenyra and Alicent will be recast as they grow older.
- The first airing of the episode seems to contain an editing error. When King Viserys gives the note to be sent to Prince Daemon, green cloth (which should have been digitally erased) can be seen on the character's left pinky and ring finger whereas the rest of the episode depicts the character's same fingers as having been clearly severed in the middle. According to HBO, they plan on remedying the error in the near future.[1]
- In the Inside the Episode, showrunners Condal and Sapochnik state that the "theme" of this episode is "childhood's end": Rhaenyra, Alicent, Viserys, and Daemon all go through a crucible and come out the other side determined who they will be in the next phase of their lives:
- Faced with his new son Aegon turning two years old (and thus having survived the cradle), Viserys is faced with a crisis of faith about whether his decision to name Rhaenyra the heir was the right one, but ends the episode determined that Rhaenyra will remain his named heir.
- Rhaenyra begins the episode frustrated that she will be replaced as heir by Aegon, and any marriage will simply be a means to get rid of her. She has a moment of catharsis in the woods unleashing all her pent up anger stabbing the boar. By the end of the episode she is sitting at her father's Small Council table (literally if not officially) and having a heart to heart discussion that her position as heir is secure, though intellectually she knows she must still marry.
- Alicent began the episode somewhat innocently thinking she could still mend her friendship with Rhaenyra, and not particularly concerned about the political implications of giving birth to a viable male heir. By the end of the episode she's come to acknowledge her father's advice that no matter what she does, many lords in the realm will not allow male-preference inheritance to be challened by allowing Rhaenyra to inherit the throne instead of Aegon - one way or another this will end in conflict.
- Daemon begins the episode as an exiled prince playing at war with mercenaries in the Stepstones, but the campaign is going badly and he may have to rely on his brother's support to bail him out again. In the climax, he makes a daring "suicide run" against the Crabfeeder's forces as human bait, carving a path through his men and personally cutting him down. Daemon has been reborn on the battlefield and reforged his reputation as the self-confident maverick he will be from here on out.
- Viewership for this episode is somewhat difficult to compare to the first two episodes, due to Labor Day holiday in the United States. According to Deadline, the overall viewership three days after the premiere was 16 million in the US across all platforms, which would generally put it on pace with the first two episodes. Viewership on HBO Max alone (not counting the HBO cable channel) was up 27% over the previous episode within the first 24 hours after the premiere.[2]
- Most of the sub-plots in the episode (among them the entire hunting trip) do not occur in Fire & Blood; others are narrated very concisely and generally (the siege of Bloodstone). Rhaenyra's encounters with the boar and the white stag/hart are loosely based on Robert Baratheon's fatal hunting trip (see below).
Filming locations
Filming locations for this episode included:
- The royal hunting camp in the Kingswood was a fully realized, practical set constructed in the woods of Surrey, England - near Caesar's Camp, outside of Aldershot.
- The battle scenes in the Stepstones were filmed on Hollywell Beach in Cornwall, England
In the Crownlands
- The entire royal hunt sequence that features in this episode is not in the source book Fire & Blood, though as the book was an outline and not a full narrative, something like this could have happened. George R.R. Martin himself may have pushed for this: he has publicly complained that one of the scenes he most regretting when working on Game of Thrones is that Robert Baratheon's royal hunt in Season 1 was limited to just five men on foot walking in a forest, not a grand royal expedition with dozens of mounted lords and hunting hounds as he described in the novels.
- The White Hart or white stag is a widespread symbol in real-life folklore, beginning in ancient Celtic myth and then filtering down into Arthurian romance, among others. "Hart" is an archaic term for stag. This specific plot point of Viserys hunting a white hart as an omen to see if Aegon should be the heir doesn't happen in the books, but it is re-using an incident that happened in the first A Song of Ice & Fire novel: when King Robert goes hunting in the Kingswood, it is mentioned that a white hart was sighted there, and that successfully hunting a white hart is seen as a great omen in Westerosi culture. Robert failed to find the white hart, however, and trackers only found its remains after it was devoured by wolves. Robert was frustrated, until another report came in that a large wild boar had been sighted, which he then pursued - and ended up mortally wounding him. Due to budget cuts almost none of this appeared in the Game of Thrones TV series, while both a boar and stags appear in this episode.
- The new Prince Aegon Targaryen should not, strictly speaking, be addressed as "Second of His Name", because this is tantamount to saying he is king already, or at least the official heir, when he is not: only ruling monarchs get assigned numbers. King Jaehaerys I Targaryen had an older brother named Aegon, but he was killed by Maegor in a civil war, and thus history remembers him only as "Aegon the Uncrowned". Viserys seems to laugh off Hobert Hightower's praise of "Aegon the Conqueror-babe, Second of His Name" as just a joke, when it's already been revealed in private with Otto that he intends to supplant Rhaenyra with Aegon.
- The political intrigue in this episode centers around how both of Viserys's children have just reached important ages at roughly the same time. Aegon just turned two years old, which means he has officially survived infancy - an important milestone due to the high rate of infant mortality even among the nobility (Aemma even mentioned that Viserys had a third son before the TV series began, but he died in the cradle). Beyond the Wall, infant mortality is so high that the wildlings have a custom to not even name their babies until they turn two years old. Rhaenyra, meanwhile, is stated to be 17 years old - she officially came of age to marry at 16 years old, though as Viserys points out she hasn't been pursuing it seriously (for the past year or so). The gathering of all the lords in honor of Aegon turning two brings the issue to a head again.
- In the books, there's a smaller gap between Rhaenyra and Aegon, of only 10 years - though Viserys still thinks the gap is big enough they shouldn't be married to each other in Targaryen fashion. Rhaenyra was aged up by seven years in the TV show. Thus Rhaenyra's coming of age couldn't have loosely coincided with Aegon's second nameday like this in the books - but due to Rhaenyra's age-shift, they now line up like this.
- In the books, the legal age of adulthood in Westeros is 16 years old. As part of aging up the younger cast, Game of Thrones at times implied that it was 18 years old - when Samwell Tarly said that his father threatened to kill him if he didn't join the Night's Watch, because he was a grown man now and set to inherit. Samwell said this was the morning of his 18th nameday in the TV show, but his 16th nameday in the books. In contrast, House of the Dragon presents that "coming of age" legally occurs at 16, as in the books: Rhaenyra is considered old enough to marry, and she remarks that she is officially "Princess of Dragonstone" now (which only legally happens when the heir apparent reaches the age of adulthood).
- During the three year time skip, two of Viserys's fingers on his left hand have been amputated. He cut his pinky finger on the Iron Throne in the first episode, and six months later in the second episode it had become badly infected, and Mellos was using maggot therapy in the hope he wouldn't need to amputate it. Not only did this not work, the infection spread and he lost his ring finger as well. This has been expanded from the books, in which this only happened much later in his reign, and the infection stopped after amputating two fingers.
- Viserys usually covers up his missing fingers with his gloves, but their absence is visible in several private scenes where he isn't wearing them. The camera never specifically points this out with a closeup of his hand. The effect was achieved by the actor wearing green sleeves over his fingers, which were then removed as a greenscreen effect.
- The scene of Lannister and Redwyne noblewomen gathered around Alicent Hightower and discussing royal politics isn't in the books, but may be acknowledging a general trend occurring at this time: as new political factions began to form at court, the Lannisters and Redwynes became prominent allies of the Hightowers.
- The other noblewoman discussing royal politics with Alicent Hightower and Ceira Lannister is Lady Joselyn Redwyne (her first name is known from the credits). This character was invented for the TV show, may be a nod to Olenna Tyrell - who was actually born "Olenna Redwyne" before marrying Lord Luthor Tyrell. Like Olenna, she is a sharp-tongued woman of House Redwyne critiquing figures at the royal court with shrewd political insight.
- The news of Johanna Swann's abduction by the Triarchy is straight from the book - which went on to explain that while the Triarchy did offer to ransom her, her famously stingy uncle refused to pay, and so she was sold to a brothel in Lys.
- Lyonel Strong's sons are introduced in this episode: elder son Harwin Strong (called "Breakbones" for his great strength) and Larys Strong, a cripple known for his prominent clubfoot. The books mention that Larys has a keen mind, rarely talking if he doesn't have to but always paying attention to those around him. Notice that during the political discussion by the noblewomen, Larys is deeply invested in the conversation even though he isn't saying anything.
- Viserys sarcastically quotes that as a child, Rhaenyra was known as "the Realm's Delight" - which was indeed her nickname as a child at the royal court.
- When they meet in the Small Council chamber, Rhaenyra accuses Viserys that "you mean to replace me with Alicent Hightower's son!" - note that she doesn't phrase this simply as her "brother". In the book, it's noted that Rhaenyra always pointedly refers to Aegon as "my half-brother", never "my brother", because of the rivalry between them.
- When Viserys laments that he can't even control his own daughter Rhaenyra, Lyonel Strong commiserates that he shouldn't feel too bad, because even King Jaehaerys I Targaryen - his grandfather and immediate predecessor, who reigned over half a century of peace and prosperity - was driven near to madness by his children, particularly his daughters. Jaehaerys was briefly seen at the beginning of the first episode. Jaehaerys's struggles with his nine children (those who survived the cradle) form an entire separate prequel era unto themselves in Fire & Blood, before the prequel era about the reign of Viserys I, and take up roughly the second quarter of the entire book.
- Viserys mentions that he was betrothed to Aemma Arryn when he was 17 years old. In the books, he indeed married Aemma when he was about 17 years old - and she was 11 years old, though the marriage wasn't consummated for another two years. The overall age gap between them was not great (six years), but their young marriage may have been because his father Baelon was named the royal heir ahead of Rhaenys only the year before, so he wanted to show that his line was secure.
- The game master estimated the white hart's weight to be "upward of 35 stone". Westeros generally uses the same Imperial measurements still used in the United States, because it is a medieval society based on custom (not abstract principles, like the metric system). The only two uncommon measurement units that really come up in the narrative are "leagues" (three miles) and "stone" (a real-life unit equal to about 14 pounds). Thus a 35 stone hart weighs about 490 pounds (roughly 222 kg).
House Lannister
Major characters Jason and Tyland Lannister are introduced in this episode. As they are identical twin brothers, they are both played by the same actor: Jefferson Hall, who actually appeared previously in Game of Thrones Season 1 as Ser Hugh of the Vale, who was killed by Gregor Clegane in the joust.
- Tyland Lannister is now Master of Ships, since Corlys Velaryon resigned in protest when Viserys rejected the marriage pact with his daughter Laena Velaryon. In the books, Corlys resigned from this post much earlier when Rhaenys was rejected as the new heir; Tyland is only mentioned as Master of Ships later in Viserys's reign. It's unknown if Viserys had a different Master of Ships earlier in his reign.
- Unlike Game of Thrones, the Starks and Lannisters do not yet have a significant position in royal affairs - they largely gained those positions due to the events of Robert's Rebellion, which hasn't happened yet. The books state that the noble families closest to the crown in the first century of Targaryen rule were the Velaryons, Hightowers, and Baratheons. There is no mention in the books of any Lannister serving on the Small Council before Tyland, and it is possible he is the first Lannister to ever hold a position at the royal court.
- Because the Lannisters played such a small role in royal affairs prior to this generation, not much is known about their full family tree connecting to other time periods. Loren I Lannister was defeated by Aegon the Conqueror but raised up as the new Lord Paramount of the Westerlands, then by the era of the Faith Militant uprising, Lyman Lannister appears in the narrative to some extent (his exact relationship to Loren is unknown). After Lyman died in 59 AC, no Lannister character is mentioned for another forty years, when it is said that Lord Tymond Lannister appeared at the Great Council of 101 AC. It is unknown if Jason and Tyland are meant to be his sons, or perhaps his grandsons or nephews, etc. This episode also introduces Ceira Lannister, a character invented for the TV show, who is apparently their mother.
Jason gives several details related to Casterly Rock and Lannisport:
- He says that Casterly Rock is three times taller than the Hightower in Oldtown, and taller still than the Wall in the North. This comparison is straight from the books: the Hightower is about 800 meters tall, and the Wall is about 700 meters tall. The Hightower is still the tallest structure in Westeros, because Casterly Rock is a mountain, with halls and chambers excavated into it.
- Jason mentions that the expensive spear he presents as a gift to Viserys was made in the Golden Hall, which is one of the main chambers in Casterly Rock.
- Jason offers Rhaenyra a fine honeyed wine made in Lannisport: Fire & Blood mentions that Lannisport is known for making a spiced honey wine.
In the Stepstones
- Caraxes reacts with pain when Daemon is hit in the shoulder with a flaming arrow. It is strongly implied in the books that dragons and their riders have some sort of unconscious psychic bond - not quite "telepathy" with words or images, but an empathic/spiritual bond, perhaps even a homing instinct.
- Daemon is hit by the flaming arrow at the beginning of the episode: notice that in the sequence at the end of the episode, some time later, Daemon has a burn wound from it on his right shoulder/collarbone. George R.R. Martin has repeatedly said that Targaryens are not "fire-proof" under normal circumstances, and that Daenerys surviving Khal Drogo's funeral pyre was a one-time magical event due to the blood sacrifice that hatched her dragons. The TV writers later had Daenerys survive burning the khals in Season 6, but this drew the criticism that it probably won't happen like that in the books because of Martin's statements to the contrary. There are multiple examples in the books of Targaryens being burned to death.
- Corlys and Daemon's quagmire in the War for the Stepstones is reminiscent of the First Dornish War: dragons are very dangerous on the battlefield or against castles, but they aren't as useful against guerrilla warfare using hit-and-run attacks. Dorne resisted the Targaryen invasion (about one century before this episode) because its forces simply fled and dispersed into the desert when the dragons came, then returned to ambush their supply lines when the dragons left. The books don't specifically describe Triarchy forces hiding in caves on Bloodstone, but generally include the point that dragons can take locations, but men are needed to hold them. Corlys and Daemon's private army is very small: in the episode Corlys says they only have about 700 footmen and 60 knights.
- There are about a dozen islands in the Stepstones but names for only two have been provided in the novels: Bloodstone is the largest, and Grey Gallows is another island south of it. Preview chapters for the sixth novel also mention a third island named Torturer's Deep. This episode introduces a new island not specified in the books: "Dwarfstone", the island that the Velaryon army camp is located on before they attack Bloodstone.
- This episode introduces Vaemond Velaryon, Corlys's younger brother. In the book, "Vaemond" is Corlys's nephew, but there are also almost a dozen minor Velaryons from younger branches of the family. In the TV show, all of them were condensed into Vaemond, who was then simplified from being a nephew to a brother.
- It is difficult to see in the battle shots, but new heraldry for several new houses is visible, including House Staunton, House Bar Emmon, House Sunglass, and House Celtigar.
- Daemon beating a messenger half to death simply for delivering news he didn't like happened in the book, but in a different context. In the book, Daemon did this in reaction to receiving news that his brother Viserys was remarrying to Alicent Hightower, barely half a year after Queen Aemma died - because this meant that relatively soon, Viserys could produce a new male heir, pushing Daemon even farther back in the line of succession. He was also in the Vale at the time, after Viserys forced him to return to his lawful wife Rhea Royce there. This episode moves the incident around, so that Daemon gives this reaction when told that Viserys will sent reinforcements to bail out his stalled campaign in the Stepstones. Daemon came there to prove himself without his brother's help, so this news motivates his bold all-or-nothing ploy to defeat the Triarchy forces before the reinforcements arrive.
- This episode introduces the dragon Seasmoke, ridden by Laenor Velaryon, making him the third to appear on-screen in this TV series. He appears to have roughly the same body proportions as Daenerys Targaryen's later trio of dragons. The showrunners explained that in developing the Dragon designs for the show, they came up with the idea that there are three kinds or breeds: those with "dinosaur" shaped skulls (what was already seen with Drogon and his brothers), but also dragons with "wolf-shaped" skulls (Caraxes), and then dragons with "horse-shaped" skulls between those two extremes (Syrax). Seasmoke is apparently the same "breed" as Daenerys's dragons.
- Daemon's heroic attack, all by himself, resembles Jaime Lannister's conduct at the Battle of the Whispering Wood (according to the novel): when the battle seemed lost, he attempted to cut his way through the Northern host to slay Robb Stark in single combat; he was halted before he could reach Robb, while Daemon managed to reach and kill Craghas.
Timeline
- It is stated in dialogue that the War for the Stepstones began three years ago (at the end of the previous episode), and this episode centers around a royal hunt held to honor Aegon's second nameday. Rhaenyra was stated to be 15 in episode 2 but is now stated to be 17. Thus slightly less than three years have elapsed (Rhaenyra's own nameday hasn't occurred yet in this year).
- The first episode began in the ninth year of Viserys I's reign, but Queen Aemma died in childbirth during the second year of his reign in the books: this change was made to age-up younger characters such as Rhaenyra. Because of this and other changes we can't simply re-use dates that events occured in the books.
- It's dated in dialogue that about half a year passes between episodes 1 and 2. The actors have confirmed that both Rhaenyra and Alicent are 14 years old in the first episode, but Rhaenyra is stated to be 15 in the second episode - within those six months she turned 15. Thus episode 2 would be either late 112 AC or early 113 AC.
- A little less than 3 years have passed, because Rhaenyra hasn't turned 18 yet. If episode 2 ended in late 112 AC, that would put this episode around mid-115 AC; if episode 2 ended in early 113 AC, plus 3 years would be early 116, but minus a few months because it wasn't a full 3 years would bring it back to around late 115 AC. Either way, it appears this episode could broadly be said to take place in "115 AC".
- This loosely matches up with the principle that the TV series pushed back most events by "7 years": in the books, Daemon killed Craghas Drahar in 108 AC.

Synopsis
Near Runestone
Prince Daemon Targaryen confronts his estranged wife, Lady Rhea Royce, while she is out hunting alone near her family's castle of Runestone. Rhea mockingly asks Daemon if he has come to consummate their marriage, or if his brother has finally expelled him from court after disinheriting Daemon in favor of a girl. Rhea asks if Daemon intends to murder his niece Rhaenyra to reclaim his former position, only to realize that Daemon has returned to the Vale solely to kill her, since as a widower, he would be free to marry again, and could easily wed his niece in the tradition of House Targaryen to reclaim his former status. Realizing her peril, Rhea tries to grab her bow, only for Daemon to spook her horse into throwing her from the saddle. Rhea is badly hurt in the fall when her horse collapses on top of her; Daemon briefly checks Rhea before making to leave, seemingly content her injuries will kill her. Rhea then taunts him that he can't "finish" her, however, at which Daemon picks up a large stone and advances to kill her.
On Driftmark
King Viserys sails to Driftmark, the island seat of House Velaryon, to propose a marriage between his daughter, Princess Rhaenyra, and Ser Laenor Velaryon, Lord Corlys Velaryon's heir. He is accompanied by Lord Lyonel Strong, recently appointed as the new Hand of the King to replace Ser Otto Hightower. The king's health is not helped by the journey, as he becomes seasick on the way and develops a light cough. They land and make the overland trip to High Tide, Lord Corlys's fabulous new castle built with the wealth from his famous voyages, located on a tidal island. They find no welcoming party in the courtyard, only Laenor sparring with his companion Ser Joffrey Lonmouth. Laenor's sister Laena Velaryon then comes from the gates and politely invites them in, informing them that Corlys was too "tired" from a recent voyage to meet them there. Lyonel is insulted that Corlys would make the king wait like this, but Viserys waves it aside: Corlys's pride was deeply wounded when Viserys declined a marriage pact with his daughter Laena, so these games are to be expected if they are to re-secure his allegiance, and they might as well get on with it. Laena, at least, is happy to see her cousin Rhaenyra, and departs with her for breakfast.
Viserys proceeds to the Hall of Nine, the main throne room which his filled with fantastical artifacts from the far corners of the Known world that Corlys brought back from his sea travels. Corlys receives Viserys and is clearly enjoying himself, for the king to come to him to request a marriage alliance to his son, but he stops short of outright arrogance. He also compliments Lord Lyonel on his recent promotion as Hand, a back-handed dig at his rival Otto Hightower's fall from grace, and informs them of Lady Rhea Royce's death. Corlys's wife Rhaenys then enters the hall, still in riding gear from her dragon. Both sides are outwardly polite but the unspoken truth is that Viserys has come to beg them to unite back with the crown, and they make a show of false modesty. Rhaenys is genuinely surprised and concerned when she notices that her cousin has lost two fingers on his left hand, though he insists he is fine. Both sides quickly agree on terms: the firstborn child of Laenor and Rhaenyra, regardless of gender, will inherit the Iron Throne. Corlys also asks that, per Westerosi tradition, their children will take their father's surname. Bemused, Viserys says he can't allow the Targaryen dynasty to end with him just because he had a daughter, but as a compromise, he offers that Laenor's children will take the surname "Velaryon", but after that Laenor's grandchildren will have to go back to using the surname "Targaryen". Corlys finds this an "equitable" solution, and the marriage pact is finalized. Viserys's cough gets worse and Corlys starts to show concern, but Viserys says he is just tired and leaves.
Later, Rhaenyra and her cousin Laenor are sent on a courtship walk along the nearby beach. Rhaenyra, however, is aware that both she and Laenor are in love with other people, and that he is no more enthusiastic about this marriage pact than she is. In a friendly conversation, she proposes a mutual arrangement: they will perform their duty for their respective families to marry and produce heirs, but otherwise they will both continue having their own private romantic relationships.
Back at the castle, Corlys expresses concern to Rhaenys that perhaps he was a little too haughty with Viserys, but Rhaenys says that Viserys knew full well what to expect when he came there. She feels it was Viserys who chose to humiliate himself, a king coming to his vassal's castle to beg for a marriage alliance. Corlys goes on to ask where Rhaenyra and Laenor have gone, and when Rhaenys says that they went for a walk along the beach, he eagerly asks if they seemed to be getting along. Rhaenys says they get along as well as can be expected, but Corlys insists that Rhaenyra has grown only more lovely these past few years and Laenor will soon be smitten with her. Rhaenys then bluntly tells her husband that they both know their son's "nature". Embarrassed, Corlys waves it off, insisting that Laenor is just young and will "grow out of it". Rhaenys is instead worried that they have forced Laenor into a dangerous marriage alliance, particularly if the lords of Westeros violently oppose Rhaenyra ascending to the Iron Throne, but Corlys embraces his wife and says this is their chance to set things to rights; that the lords of the realm wronged her and their children by rejecting her as queen as the Great Council, but she says she made peace with this a long time ago, as she can't be robbed of something she didn't have in the first place.
After Rhaenyra departs, Laenor sits in private among the beach dunes with Joffrey Lonmouth, revealing that Laenor and Joffrey are actually lovers in a same-sex relationship. Joffrey chides Laenor for still being so worried, as the meeting with Rhaenyra went well beyond their wildest hopes: a bride for Laenor who is fully aware of his relationship with Joffrey who will not only allow it to continue, but isn't even offended, as she intends to have private lovers of her own. Laenor gives him a light shove but the tension breaks and they soon kiss each other passionately.
As Viserys's ship heads back across Blackwater Bay to King's Landing, Ser Criston Cole confronts Rhaenyra on the deck. He tells her he knows she doesn't love Laenor and for years she's talked about her fear of being trapped in a loveless arranged marriage. Instead, he pleads with her to flee with him into exile beyond Westeros, where they can be married. Rhaenyra gently insists that she still has duties to her family and to the realm itself, so she can never leave or marry him, but she doesn't consider this a problem because she just worked out an "understanding" with Laenor. Criston, however, shifts tone and angrily says that he doesn't just want to be Rhaenyra's "whore": he came from nothing and his honor as a Kingsguard is all he has, honor that he forever sullied when he broke his sacred vow of chastity with her. He says that his hope was to restore at least a part of his honor by lawfully marrying her. Rhaenyra begins to explain again that this is impossible, but Criston storms off.
At the Red Keep
On a rainy day in King's Landing, Ser Otto Hightower prepares to ride out of the Red Keep with his household guards and return to Oldtown, now that he has been replaced as Hand of the King. His daughter Queen Alicent Hightower emotionally pleads with him that she believes Rhaenyra's claim that she is still a virgin, and that his dismissal isn't just due to this but the culmination of pushing too hard for her son Aegon Targaryen to be named the new heir. Otto gravely chides her for her naivety and presents her with the cold logic of the situation: Viserys's health is failing and whenever he eventually dies, Rhaenyra will have to kill Alicent's children whether she wants to or not, simply to ensure her own survival. Alicent therefore has only two choices: either start plotting to secure her position at court against Rhaenyra, or fully commit to ingratiating herself with her stepdaughter and hope that when Rhaenyra takes the throne, this will make her merciful enough towards Alicent that she won't kill her half-siblings. Unable to express in words that he loves her and wants to protect her, Otto gives Alicent a desperate final embrace and then rides out of the castle.
Alicent then goes to the castle's godswood for solitude but she encounters Larys Strong, the crippled and soft-spoken younger son of Lord Lyonel Strong. Larys remarks on flowers from Braavos that are maintained in the garden, removed from their native climate, which have nonetheless managed to thrive there (a clear allusion to Alicent herself). He then makes a back-handed inquiry into Rhaenyra's health, so that when Alicent asks what cause he has for such concern, he "accidentally" reveals that the same night Daemon was exiled again Rhaenyra was presented with a medicinal tea brewed by Grand Maester Mellos himself. Alicent realizes his unstated implication that Rhaenyra must have received Moon tea, an abortifacient drug, and therefore she must have truly had sex with Daemon.
After Criston Cole returns from Driftmark, Alicent then summons him to her chambers and dismisses her servants so they can speak in private. Alicent is hesitant and carefully chooses her words, starting to say that she has heard rumors that Rhaenyra is no longer a virgin, though not specifying who she had sex with. Overcome with guilt and distraught at Rhaenyra's rejection of his marriage offer, Criston confesses that the rumors are true, because he is the one who had sex with Rhaenyra. This surprises her, as she had assumed the culprit was Rhaenyra's uncle Daemon. Criston says that even if Rhaenyra initiated things, it is still his own fault for abandoning his Kingsguard vows. Criston pleads that if Alicent is a merciful queen, he only makes the small request that he be granted a quick death by execution, instead of the gelding and drawn-out torture that by right the king will subject him to. Alicent, however, is utterly stunned at Rhaenyra's betrayal, realizing that she used a lie of exact words to swear on her dead mother's memory that she never had sex with Daemon, but she still wasn't a virgin. While some of the details were inaccurate, Otto was fundamentally correct to suspect Rhaenyra of losing her virginity and jeopardizing the upcoming marriage alliance, thus Rhaenyra indirectly cost Alicent's father his high-ranking position at court. Her heart hardening, Alicent surprises Criston by quietly telling him to go and return to his duties.
When King Viserys arrives back at the castle from his journey, however, he collapses as soon as he dismounts from his carriage in the courtyard. Rushed to his private chambers, he recovers slightly in a bathtub while attended by his maesters. Amputating the two fingers on the king's left hand only slowed the advance of the persistent infection, and now after several more years it has once again continued to spread along much of his forearm. Grand Maester Mellos insists on yet another round of leechings, but his new young aide Maester Orwyle instead suggests that a new mixture of medicines in a poultice might be more effective. The conservative old maester scoffs at this and says his leechings have always improved the king's condition, though the elderly Mellos then struggles to stand back up (hinting that his time as Grand Maester may be coming to an end before much longer). After he leaves, Orwyle hands Lord Lyonel a new medicine anyway and says that drinking it will help the king sleep. Now alone, Viserys laments to Lyonel that he doesn't think he'll be much remembered as king, because he wasn't a great warrior and made no glorious conquests, but neither did he suffer any major defeats. Lyonel says that many would consider that a good legacy. Pained, Viserys smiles but says that a peaceful and uneventful reign isn't the stuff of epic songs retold at feasts. He then ponders wistfully, that if some great crisis had occurred when he was younger, it's possible he might have risen to the occasion and in that crucible been forged into a different, better man. Rather than humour him, Lyonel says many yearn for that test but in truth most men faced with crisis wish it hadn't come to them. Viserys respects his honesty, but can't help but think of another life he may have had and wonder about his legacy.
The royal wedding
The long-awaited royal wedding ceremonies finally begin: first a grand feast in the Red Keep, to be followed by seven days of tournaments and spectacle, culminating with the marriage ceremony. The Velaryons arrive on their dragons: Laenor on Seasmoke, and his mother Rhaenys on the older and larger Meleys. Meanwhile, Corlys and the full Velaryon fleet arrive in the harbour, as the city's bells toll out to greet them for the festivities.
The feast is held in the throne room itself. Envoys from all the major noble houses of the realm are announced in turn by Ser Harrold Westerling as they enter, such as Lord Jason Lannister and Lord Hobert Hightower (with the notable absence of Otto). Viserys and Rhaenyra sit at the middle of the high table set up in front of the throne's base and receive each in group, though Queen Alicent is noticeably late and has yet to arrive. The entire room comes to a halt for the entrance of the stunning entourage of House Velaryon, dressed in extravagant gold tracery. Corlys, Rhaenys, Laenor, and Ser Vaemond take their seat at one side of the high table. The assembled guests are surprised, however, when just after the Velaryon entourage finishes coming through the doors, Daemon Targaryen follows some distance behind them, even though his brother Viserys exiled him for a second time and told him never to return. As Daemon was Corlys's partner in the capture of the Stepstones, however, they are the only faction at court where he is somewhat welcome. After a tense moment, Viserys silently welcomes his brother back, as it seems Daemon is appearing out of courtesy for his niece's wedding. Viserys orders another chair brought up to the high table for Daemon, next to Lyonel Strong at the opposite side from the Velaryons. After the moment with Daemon has passed, Viserys rises to give a speech in praise of House Velaryon as the crown's most faithful and powerful allies, and that this marriage will unite both families as one.
Just then, Queen Alicent enters through the main doors, intentionally interrupting the king in the middle of his speech. Alicent is dressed in a green dress. Larys notes to his brother Ser Harwin Strong that when House Hightower calls its bannermen to assemble for war, the watch fire in the Hightower is set to burn a green color: in effect, green is the Hightowers' war color. Alicent silently makes her way through the feast hall as all, save for Daemon, rise for her presence. When she reaches the high table she gives Viserys a curt peck on the cheek. Alicent coldly congratulates Rhaenyra, referring to her only as "stepdaughter". Her fixed, sharp glares and dramatic entrance make it clear to Rhaenyra that she knows she was lied to, and their friendship is over. Viserys returns to his speech, concluding with his hope that just as the Velaryons have followed the Targaryens since the age of dragons in Valyria, this new union will usher in a second age of dragons in Westeros.
Despite the tense entrances of Daemon and then Alicent, they are behaving civil in public, so the tension subsides and the wedding feast begins in earnest. Musicians begin to play as Rhaenyra and Laenor begin the first dance of the evening, and they are then joined by dozens of other couples in a large-scale ballroom dance. Alicent leaves the high table and approaches her uncle Hobert, who affirms Oldtown's support of Alicent. Ser Gerold Royce then approaches the high table to openly accuse that Daemon killed his cousin Rhea Royce, as her riding skill is so well known she couldn't possibly have died in an accident. Daemon warns him that such accusations are not only serious but have little evidence, but he will have time to hear them out again when Daemon goes to the Eyrie to present Lady Jeyne Arryn with his claims over his dead wife's inheritance to Runestone. Gerold leaves, and from across the table Daemon exchanges glances with Corlys's daughter Laena (now an attractive young maiden of 17 years). When Laena goes to the dance floor Daemon cuts in to pair with her, and they exchange light flirtations.
Meanwhile, from observing how Rhaenyra and Criston keep glancing at each other, Joffrey Lonmouth accurately deduces that Criston is her secret lover, and notes this to Laenor. Lonmouth then makes his way over to Criston and speaks of their informal alliance, and how both of them will protect the secrets of Rhaenyra and Laenor. Lonmouth has no way of knowing that Criston desperately wanted to marry Rhaenyra to restore his honor, and is on the verge of a complete breakdown.
Daemon then cuts in to dance with Rhaenyra, and they speak in High Valyrian to keep their conversation private from those around them. Daemon urges Rhaenyra that she hasn't married Laenor yet, and though he thinks he's a good man and brave knight, he will "bore" Rhaenyra in their sham marriage, so she has this one last chance to run away with Daemon now that his wife is dead. Rhaenyra, however, feels spurned by Daemon and suspects that he only wants to marry her to gain political power for himself. As they exchange fiery words, they come close to kissing. Viserys angrily observes Daemon through the crowd, but just then they are interrupted by a piercing cry from a different part of the feast floor.
A brawl has broken out in the packed room, but it becomes clear that at the center of it Criston Cole has begun pummeling Joffrey Lonmouth. Laenor manages to struggle his way through to them and tackles Criston off Lonmouth, but Criston rises and punches out the groom. As waves of scuffles ripple out it nearly turns into a human crush. Another angry guest throws Laenor over a table and away from Criston. Rhaenyra is nearly trampled but Lyonel sends his son Harwin to save her: Harwin tosses and punches people in the crowd aside to reach Rhaenyra, then slings her over his shoulder and wades out to safety. Criston kneels on Lonmouth's chest and continues his savage beating. Lonmouth manages to pull out his dagger, but Criston easily blocks it and snaps his arm. Criston then flies into a dark fury, shouting and punching Lonmouth over and over again, the onlookers too stunned and afraid to intervene. Criston keeps punching until his arm is so tired he cannot lift it anymore, revealing that he has beaten Lonmouth's face in with his bare hands and killed him. The left side of Lonmouth's face is cracked open down to the skull, trailing viscera onto the floor. Criston silently rises and slowly walks out of the throne room, the other guards too terrified to stop him. As the guests clear the floor, Laenor regains consciousness nearby and rushes over to his lover, only to see that his face has been reduced to gore. Laenor wails in anguish while cradling his body. The stress is too much for Viserys's already delicate health, and he begins to bleed copiously from his nose.
Unobserved, Criston makes his way to the godswood, and slowly removes his white cloak and armor, now stained in Lonmouth's blood. Criston kneels in front of the sacred weirwood heart tree, and calmly and deliberately draws his dagger, preparing to kill himself. At the last moment Alicent appears and calls his name, preventing his suicide. Rhaenyra has ended this day with two major enemies bitterly opposed to her.
Some hours later, all of the guests have been ordered out and King Viserys has cancelled the seven days of festivities and games leading to the wedding ceremony. Instead, determined to finish this as quickly as possible, Viserys has called in the High Septon to wed Rhaenyra and Laenor in a private exchange of vows in front of their respective parents and close advisors. Rhaenyra and Laenor are still in shock and crying, as they go through the rote exchange of vows on their now ruined wedding day. The High Septon concludes and pronounces them officially married: at this release Viserys, who had been holding himself together on pure adrenaline, drops to the floor in a full faint. His aides rush to tend to him, while on the other side of the throne room, rats lick at the pools of Lonmouth's still warm blood.

Behind the scenes
General
- The title of the episode refers to the motto of House Hightower.
- This is the first episode of House of the Dragon to be titled after a house's words; three episodes of Game of Thrones shared titles with house mottos: "Winter Is Coming" (House Stark), "Fire and Blood" (House Targaryen), and "Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken" (House Martell). This is also the first time the words of a vassal house have been used as an episode title.
- This is the first episode in the entire World of Westeros franchise to have both a female writer and a female director. Game of Thrones didn't have a female writer after Season 3, and didn't have a female director after Season 4. Three episodes in House of the Dragon: Season 1 will have female writer & director pairings, including this one.
- In terms of the Timeline, this is the first episode in House of the Dragon: Season 1 that doesn't have a notable time skip. According to Ryan Condal, there are three major time skips in the first season which involve recasting actors, the smallest of which was the three-year gap between the second and third episodes. There were also smaller passages of time between other episodes: six months between the first and second episodes, one year between the third and fourth episodes. This episode follows soon after the previous one, however, just the few weeks or months it would take for the great lords of the realm to convene in King's Landing for a royal wedding. The episode therefore presumably occurs in the same year that the previous one did, which appears to be 116 AC.
- Viewership for this episode again rose over the preceding episodes. Across the HBO linear cable channel and HBO Max combined, in the United States alone, the first episode had 10 million viewers and the second had 10.2 million. After that the Labor Day holiday weekend in the United States made viewership difficult to determine for the third episode, but the fourth episode increased by "about 5%" across all platforms. According to Variety, episode five increased on that by about another 3%.[1]
Filming locations
Filming locations for this episode included:
- The exteriors for High Tide castle on Driftmark are not CGI or a matte painting, but the famous castle of St Michael's Mount on the south coast of Cornwall, England. "High Tide" is so-called because it is a tidal island, with a land bridge connecting it to the main island at low tide which gets subsumed by the ocean when the tide rises. Rather than digitally add these elements, the production team simply found a castle that is actually located on a real-life tidal island which was willing to allow filming there. Thus the shot of the royal carriage crossing a sand bar at low tide to reach the castle on an outcropping in the distance is entirely real.
- Rhaenyra and Laenor's walk along the nearby beach of Driftmark, was filmed at Holywell beach, which is on the north coast of Cornwall.
- The rolling moors near Runestone where Rhea Royce encounters Daemon were filmed at Derbyshire, northern England. The sandy main floor of the Dragonpit in the first episode was actually filmed at a nearby quarry.
Near Runestone
- Runestone was previously seen briefly in the Game of Thrones: Season 5 premiere, "The Wars To Come". It is an ancient castle, and has the same appearance as it did in that episode.
- Rhea Royce's bronze armor is covered in Old Tongue runes of the First Men. Game of Thrones previously used Elder futhark runes to represent these in the sigil of House Royce, but the runes on her armor are much more extensive. Rather than just use random runes or develop a long in-universe narrative with them, when translated the Old Tongue runes on Rhea's armor are copied verbatim from the Codex Runicus, a Danish book of laws from around the year 1300 written in medieval futhark runes. Perhaps not by coincidence, the Codex Runicus is the example image used in the top infobox in Wikipedia's article on "Runes" (i.e. it appears someone in the props department looked up "runes" and copy-pasted the first example).
- Rhea's taunting quote to Daemon about the sheep of the Vale being prettier than the women are a callback to what he said in "The Heirs of the Dragon", meaning that either word got back to her of the insult he made about her at the small council, or that it's an insult he's made on more than one occasion.
- As Ryan Condal explains in the Inside the Episode, Fire & Blood never says that Daemon killed his wife Rhea, but has one cryptic line that she suddenly died in a chance fall from her horse. Condal was intrigued by this and speculated it could imply her death was no accident. There has been fan speculation that Daemon may have been responsible, but in the books he couldn't have personally done it because he was still in the Stepstones at the time (i.e. he might have hired one of the Faceless Men to kill her, and they try to make their assassinations look like accidents). Condal also said that they made it intentionally ambiguous whether Daemon intentionally threw Rhea's horse or not: it could have been pre-meditated murder, but Daemon is also known for deftly taking advantage of spontaneous opportunities. Even if it was an accident, however, Daemon then seized on this chance to finish off Rhea with a stone.
- Later during the wedding feast, Daemon says he intends to press his claim to his widow's lands by going to the Eyrie and petitioning Lady Jeyne. This is the first mention of Lady Jeyne Arryn, the current head of House Arryn and ruler of the Vale in her own right, who will be a major recurring character. Jeyne inherited rule after her father and brothers died: under normal inheritance law, a lord's daughter inherits ahead of the lord's younger brothers (by this principle Rhaenys should actually have inherited the Iron Throne, but the Great Council voted to ignore this). Through Aemma Arryn, Jeyne is Rhaenyra's cousin on her mother's side.
- It's unclear why Daemon didn't try to sire at least one child with Rhea, as this would have given him much better claim over her lands. Apparently, he hated her so much he couldn't bring himself to do it. In the behind the scenes video, Condal says that Rhea isn't actually unattractive (as Daemon keeps saying) and isn't a bad person in general, but she personally dislikes Daemon and he can't stand her for it.
On Driftmark
- Behind the scenes videos extensively go over the highly detailed design of the "Hall of Nine", the main hall in High Tide containing the Driftwood Throne. The videos state that it is called the "Hall of Nine" in reference to all of the artifacts from Corlys's famous nine voyages of sea exploration to the corners of the Known world.
- Ryan Condal and Production Designer Jim Clay explained that the underlying idea behind the interiors of High Tide is that it is an entirely new castle: Corlys had the castle built all in his own lifetime using the wealth from his voyages. Other castles such as Winterfell or Highgarden were expanded incrementally over many centuries. Even the Red Keep itself, which was designed and built in its final form, was finished over sixty years ago. The fact that Corlys had the wealth to build an entirely new castle all at once with no price limit means that he could use more experimental architecture, such as the complicated spiral design to the main staircase, paralleled by a curving main entryway behind it. Jim Clay said that the murals and overall color scheme were inspired by the interiors of the Byzantine Hagia Sophia. The main floor to ceiling mural next to the staircase depicts Corlys's ship, the Sea Snake.
- The Hall of Nine contains props of the treasures Corlys collected on his voyages, and the production team fully worked out where each of them comes from. Actor Steve Toussaint asked Ryan Condal to come up with some background details on each item so he'd know what they were when he was looking at them, and he was surprised when Condal came back with very extensive background descriptions for each of them, even though none of it appears in dialogue.
- One of the notable easter eggs in the hall is that it contains accurate updated maps of the world from The Lands of Ice & Fire (2012). Due to legal rights issues, Game of Thrones had to rely on earlier maps from 2011 even through its final season. World maps in Game of Thrones therefore contained several errors for the lands around the Jade Sea in the far east, and didn't depict Sothoryos or the Summer Isles. The Hall of Nine contains a prominent world map as a mural to the left of the main staircase, as well as several more detailed navigational maps scattered on Corlys's desk.
- One of the items in Corlys's collection appears to be a giant mollusk shell the size of a wagon wheel. This is not artwork but (a prop of) a real shell: The World of Ice & Fire (2014) stated that crabs and lobsters of "truly monstrous size" can be found in the Shivering Sea, which Corlys passed through on one of his voyages.
- Another of the items in Corlys's collection is a mammoth skull: in another of his voyages he sailed north to Hardhome beyond the Wall, in a failed attempt to find a northwest passage to the other side of Westeros.
- Corlys remarks that the Velaryons currently control half of the realm's dragons. He is appears to be strictly referring to dragons with riders, the ones that are actually "controlled". At this specific time there are only four dragons bonded to riders: Laenor and Rhaenys have Seasmoke and Meleys, Rhaenyra has Syrax, and Daemon has Caraxes. Corlys doesn't appear to include Daemon in that count, as while he has allied with Corlys he is very much his own agent.
- A prequel series has been pitched which would cover the voyages of young Corlys around the world, under the working title "The Sea Snake". When this episode was made in 2022 it had advanced from the pitch phase and HBO had ordered a pilot script from writer Steve Conrad, though as with other proposed prequels, a greenlight is on hold until HBO sees how well House of the Dragon itself performs.
- Rhaenyra euphemistically discusses Laenor's sexual orientation using the analogy of food appetites, that some people simply prefer duck instead of goose. Fire & Blood didn't use these exact lines, but did refer to Laenor's sexuality using a food metaphor: when the match to Laenor was presented to the small council, the objection was raised that Laenor had never expressed interest in women, and seemed to prefer the company of handsome young men his own age; Grand Maester Mellos dismissed this out of hand by retorting, "What of it? I am not fond of fish, but when fish is served, I eat it."
- Laenor's sexual orientation is something of an open secret at the royal court in the book, though the exact extent of who knew about it is unclear. Rhaenyra refers to it when talking to her father Viserys before the marriage, and later Criston Cole remarks about it to Alicent and her advisors. The book doesn't mention if Laenor's parents knew or if they did what their attitude towards it was. Corlys's line insisting that Laenor is just young and will "outgrow it" isn't in the book. Laenor's parents generally seemed to have a good relationship with him.
- In terms of Gender and sexuality in Westeros, much like the real middle ages, homosexuality isn't actively persecuted as some sort of major crime, but it is frowned upon as a venal sin of the flesh, loosely comparable to adultery. Like adultery, people don't talk about it in public, but it still happens despite the Faith's misgivings (i.e. Robert Baratheon's infidelities, and noble bastards are so common they have an entire system of special surnames for them).
- There are two brief lines in Fire & Blood possibly implying that Laena Velaryon is also interested in same-sex relationships: a one line reference from a maester (when the proposed marriage pact between her and Viserys was rejected) that she was more interested in flying dragons than kissing boys, and a mention that after marrying Laenor, Rhaenyra "grew fond and more than fond" of her sister-in-law. No further comment or context was given. It is notable that in this episode Laena is actually happy to see Rhaenyra and pleasantly leads her off to breakfast.
- The Viserys and Rhaenys branches of the Targaryens in this episode refer to each other as "cousin" without specifying degree: to reiterate, Viserys is Rhaenys's first cousin, making Rhaenyra second cousin to both Laenor and Laena. Even first cousin marriage, however, is officially not considered incest in Westeros (though uncle-niece relationships are).
- Laenor and Laena are already familiar with Rhaenyra because as cousins of the king, they have appeared at the royal court before. Both of them were present with Rhaenyra in the royal viewing box at the tournament in the first episode, even though they had no speaking lines in it (or with Rhaenyra), but presumably they've interacted before off-screen.
At the Red Keep
- Criston Cole begs Alicent to grant him the mercy of a quick execution, instead of gelding him and subjecting him to prolonged torture. This is actually what happened to the last Kingsguard who broke his vow of chastity, Lucamore Strong, in a scandal about 30 years before this which would still be within living memory. Lucamore didn't even have sex with the king's own daughter, but it was found that he had not only broken his vow of chastity, but bigamously married three separate women and fathered children with them, each ignorant of the others' existence.
- Maester Orwyle is introduced in this episode as a younger assistant to Grand Maester Mellos. In the book, Mellos is indeed an old-minded physician who insists on the benefits of frequent leechings; but Orwyle doesn't arrive in King's Landing until after Mellos eventually dies. Instead, it is Maester Gerardys who starts treating Viserys somewhat more effectively with various medicinal potions and tinctures. Of course, as both Gerardys and Orwyle are both from a younger generation of maesters than Mellos, it's possible that this is part of a general shift away from leechings in Westerosi medicine.
- This episode marks the debut of Rhaenys's dragon, Meleys. She is called the Red Queen due to her scarlet scales, with copper highlights on her horns. Meleys is larger than Laenor's dragon Seasmoke but appears to be the same "breed", raising the possibility that Meleys is Seasmoke's mother. The books simply do not give lineages for any of the dragons.
- Ryan Condal admitted in interviews that the dwarf performing with the royal musicians is meant to be their version of Mushroom, the debauched court jester from Fire & Blood, who later produced an utterly ribald and distorted historical account of these events filled with lies and fabrications.
- On the dance floor, Daemon asks Laena, "Has anyone ever told you that you're almost as pretty as your brother?" - in the book, Mushroom himself remarks that Laena is exceptionally beautiful, "almost as pretty as her brother".
- In the book, Alicent starts wearing iconic green dresses but no explanation is given for this choice: she apparently just liked the color green. The detail actually is in the books, however, that House Hightower changes the signal fire on their lighthouse to a green flame when they are calling their banners to war. Thus, green is the Hightower's "war color". It's unknown if this reasoning behind Alicent's dresses originated from Martin, or if Condal and his writing team just developed it retroactively after noting the possible connection.
- Condal points out in behind the scenes videos that in the book, the point when Alicent first wore an iconic green dress happened at a tournament a few years before Rhaenyra's marriage, but it was condensed together with the marriage in the TV version.
- In the book, at the aforementioned event Rhaenyra dressed dramatically in Targaryen red and black, as opposed to the green gown Alicent wore; this was the beginning point of the division of the court to "Greens" (supporters of Alicent's son Aegon) and "Blacks" (Rhaenyra's supporters).
- Note that in the books, the color of the signal fire on House Hightower's sigil is actually that of a normal red flame: the TV version changed it to always been the green flame, as it would appear on a shield facing their enemies in wartime.
- Condal points out in behind the scenes videos that in the book, the point when Alicent first wore an iconic green dress happened at a tournament a few years before Rhaenyra's marriage, but it was condensed together with the marriage in the TV version.
- It is only shown in wideshot, but when Alicent makes her entrance and approaches the throne, everyone in the audience and at the royal table rises to their feet to honor her except for Daemon, who remains seated. If it wasn't for Viserys's remarriage to Alicent, Daemon would still be the only male heir to the throne. Daemon even remains seated when Alicent walks directly past him to reach her seat at the middle of the table.
- Director Clare Kilner points out in the behind the scenes videos that "Dance", as an art form, never appeared in Game of Thrones whatsoever, so she and her team had to put considerable thought into developing the style of the wedding dance scenes for this episode. There simply weren't dance scenes in the A Song of Ice & Fire books, and while they mention that certain characters are fond of dance, fundamentally it doesn't translate well in a non-visual medium. Kilner's team wasn't happy with the first dance style they came up with, so they revised it to be less "contemporary".
- Joffrey says that he's called "the Knight of Kisses" but he doesn't know why. In the book, it's because of the heraldry of House Lonmouth: a field quartered six ways, alternating between red lips on yellow and yellow skulls on black. Their motto is "The Choice is Yours" (either be a friend and get kisses, or be an enemy and get death/skulls).
- Criston Cole doesn't kill Joffrey Lonmouth in the middle of the wedding feast in the book: he mortally injured him at the following tournament held to celebrate the wedding (in the episode Viserys mentions they will hold seven days of tourneys and festivals before the wedding ceremony, but this is abruptly canceled due to Lonmouth's death). This introduces the question of how Criston in the TV series could escape judgement for his actions, because in the book killing a man in a tournament isn't considered murder.
- While Alicent encountering Criston in the godswood is shown in montage with Rhaenrya and Laenor exchanging wedding vows, they don't actually take place at the same time, because Alicent can be seen behind Viserys during the exchange of wedding vows.
- This episode again brings up the issue of the "unreliable narrator" in the source material, which gives two alternate versions of how Rhaenyra and Criston broke up:
- The preceding episode addressed how Rhaenyra lost her virginity, which has two conflicting sources in the book. Septon Eustace says that Daemon had sex with Rhaenyra, while Mushroom's debauched and unreliable account claims that Daemon took Rhaenyra to brothels so she could train to seduce Criston Cole, but he ultimately rejected her, then Daemon asked Viserys to marry her because no one else would have her now. The TV show took a third option between the two, presenting that both accounts were wrong, and Rhaenyra actually did have sex with Criston.
- In contrast, this episode wholly uses Eustace's version for how Rhaenyra and Criston broke up (other than that Eustace never said they had sex). Eustace said that Criston was smitten with Rhaenyra and begged her to run away with him into exile, but she rejected his offer of marriage due to her duty to the throne. The book version goes on to have Rhaenyra point out that if Criston would abandon his vow as a Kingsguard, she couldn't trust that a marriage vow would mean much to him. The only difference is that in the book Criston snuck into Rhaenyra's chambers to profess his love, while in the TV show he does it on their boat as they return from Driftmark. Mushroom's alternate version of these events is that Rhaenyra tried to seduce Criston for a second time and was again refused: this probably didn't happen, not only because Mushroom is repeating himself, but because it doesn't account for why, if Criston was the one who rejected Rhaenyra and not the other way around, he then flew into a "dark fury" at the subsequent wedding tournament and mortally wounded Joffrey Lonmouth.

Premise
After Rhaenyra cuts short her tour of Westeros, Daemon introduces the princess to the Street of Silk after dark.
Synopsis
At Storm's End
About one year after the royal hunt in the Kingswood, Rhaenyra Targaryen is touring the realm to hold audiences with potential suitors for her hand in marriage. On her most recent stop she is at Storm's End, the seat of House Baratheon in the Stormlands. Potential suitors are lined up in the main hall, introduced in turn by Lord Boremund Baratheon, while the princess is given the honor of sitting on his throne. Rhaenyra is frustrated that many of the suitors are either too old or too young, or lords of minor houses.
After dismissing the elderly Lord Dondarrion, she is surprised to see the underaged Willem Blackwood put himself forward. Though he is well-spoken, and Lord Boremund points out that the Blackwoods are a reasonably powerful noble house in the Riverlands, Rhaenyra does not take his proposal seriously. Blackwood is repeatedly interrupted with mockery by Jerrel Bracken, as House Blackwood and House Bracken have been bitterly feuding with each other for centuries.
Bored, Rhaenyra asks to hear the next suitor in line so they can finish up and go to supper. Dejected, Blackwood turns to leave, but as he goes Jerrel Bracken calls him a craven. Fed up with his continued insults, Blackwood draws his sword and approaches Jerrel, who eagerly draws his own dagger and advances to meet him. Rhaenyra tells her sworn shield Ser Criston Cole that they should leave. They casually head for the exit as the duel continues behind them, despite Lord Boremund barking orders for the boys to sheathe their steel. Rhaenyra orders Criston to send word to have her ship prepared to sail back to King's Landing, even though her tour for suitors was supposed to continue on to Bitterbridge. Just as Rhaenyra and Criston reach the hall's doors, they hear a yell and turn around to see that Blackwood has managed to run through Jerrel with his sword: the mortally wounded boy lays on the ground choking on his own blood while his father Lord Humfrey Bracken rushes to his side. Willem Blackwood, stunned at what just happened, begins to vomit.
Return to King's Landing
As Rhaenyra and Criston's ship sails back into the harbor of King's Landing, she is apprehensive that her father will be upset that she not only rejected every proposed suitor, but canceled the rest of the tour two months early to return home. Just then they hear the cries of Caraxes overhead, as Daemon Targaryen buzzes their ship with his dragon (dangerously rocking it) on the way to return to the royal court for the first time in four years.
A full courtroom of noblemen and women assemble before the Iron Throne, as Viserys I Targaryen puts on his full regalia to formally receive his wayward younger brother. Daemon jauntily enters the throne room, not only still carrying Dark Sister sheathed at his hip, but playfully tossing the war hammer of Craghas Crabfeeder in his hand - and wearing his own crown, made of bone and driftwood. As he reaches the base of the throne, Lord Commander Harrold Westerling draws his own sword and points it slowly into Daemon's chest plate to ward him off. The tension breaks when Daemon throws the war hammer on the ground in front of the Iron Throne and says to add it to the chair (made from the melted weapons of their defeated enemies). Harrold sheathes his own sword, and Viserys points out that Daemon is wearing a crown, inquiring if he also calls himself king. Daemon says that his men hailed him as "King of the Narrow Sea" after he led them to smash the Triarchy's forces and conquer the Stepstones, but he quickly adds that he knows that there is only one true king. Daemon then kneels and offers up both his crown and the Stepstones to his older brother. Viserys asks what became of Corlys Velaryon, and Daemon says he sailed back home to Driftmark (not bothering to present himself at the royal court, due to his rift with Viserys). Viserys also asks who now holds the Stepstones, to which Daemon replies the tides, the crabs, and the corpses of 2000 Triarchy corsairs left staked on the shore as a warning to any who might follow Drahar's example. Viserys comes down from the throne, with his sheathed sword Blackfyre in hand, and is at first hesitant about what to do. After a moment, he orders Daemon to rise, and the two brothers embrace. The entire court applauds their reconciliation.
Viserys then hosts a feast in Daemon's honor in the Red Keep's godswood. Viserys gets somewhat drunk, sharing happy stories with the brother he hasn't seen since Queen Aemma's death and the ensuing succession woes four years before. The king good-naturedly admits that Daemon was always their mother Alyssa's favorite, as like him she was a rule-breaker who didn't care about custom or tradition. Queen Alicent Hightower then approaches and welcomes Daemon, inviting him to see the new fine tapestries from Norvos and Qohor on display in the gallery. Viserys laughs, as Daemon is uninterested in tapestries and artwork. Rhaenyra says she would like to see them and excuses herself, to talk with Alicent on a bench.
Alicent surmises that the tour did not go well, if Rhaenyra has returned early. Rhaenyra says she "endured it" for as long as she could. Alicent sarcastically chides that having every knight and lord in the Seven Kingdoms fawning over Rhaenyra must have been "misery," then urges Rhaenyra that it is rare for girls in the realm to get a choice between two suitors, much less forty of them. Rhaenyra counters that these men aren't fawning over her, it's her name and bloodline they want, to advance their own status. When Alicent says she still thinks it sounds romantic, Rhaenyra blurts out that she doesn't see what's so romantic about marrying so she can be locked up in a castle and "made to squeeze out heirs." Alicent is quietly wounded, as this now exactly describes her situation in life. Embarrassed, Rhaenyra apologizes.
Shifting topics, Rhaenyra asks how angry her father is. Trying to be diplomatic, Alicent says Viserys put great effort into arranging her tour, so he is of course frustrated that she ended it early. Alicent says she's happy that Rhaenyra is home: she admits that she has very few friends now, and is in fact quite lonely. She says she wishes she was still the "Lady Alicent," but these days everyone at court just thinks of her as "the queen," an accessory to the king. Feeling sorry for Alicent, Rhaenyra holds her hand to offer her comfort, and for now the two are somewhat reconciled from their estrangement the past few years.
Some time later, Rhaenyra finds Daemon standing alone under the weirwood heart tree. Rhaenyra and her uncle continue to have a private conversation in High Valyrian while retiring to a row of seats near the feast tables along the colonnade. Rhaenyra says that her father is intent on selling her off to the lord with the biggest castle, and though she doesn't mind the attention, the rest she can do without. Daemon slyly says that marriage is just a political arrangement; it wouldn't stop her from seeking private pleasures. Rhaenyra says that it might be just a political arrangement for men, but for women it is like a death sentence, and she reveals that she is bitterly worried about ending up like her mother, made to produce new potential heirs until she died in childbirth. She refuses to accept that she will have the same fate. Daemon advises that she cannot live her life in fear, or she will forsake the best parts of it. Rhaenyra says she doesn't intend to live in fear, only in pleasant solitude.
At the Small Council
King Viserys attends a meeting of his Small Council, with Rhaenyra no longer serving as cupbearer but having a full seat on the council. Tyland Lannister, who replaced Corlys Velaryon as Master of Ships after he resigned in protest, brings troubling news: it seems they have traded the Crabfeeder for the Sea Snake, as now that the Velaryon fleet holds the Stepstones, Lord Corlys can control the vital sea lanes going through it, giving him considerable leverage over the crown. Viserys is surprised that Corlys would still be upset about his spurning a marriage alliance with young Laena Velaryon years ago, but Grand Maester Mellos says that Lord Corlys is a prideful man and that pride has been wounded, and they must seek to salve it.
Otto Hightower, however, reveals the situation is worse than that: he has received a disturbing report from his brother in Oldtown that Corlys Velaryon has entered into negotiations with the Sealord of Braavos. The report says that Corlys intends to secure a marriage alliance with Braavos by wedding his daughter Laena to the Sealord's son. Otto notes the obvious: if Corlys succeeds, it will add even more pressure for Viserys to quickly force Rhaenyra into a marriage pact, to secure new allies of their own to counterbalance the Velaryons. Rhaenyra hears this out in silence.
A long night in King's Landing
Rhaenyra returns to her chambers for the night, but finds a sack has been left on her table. Opening it, she finds a common page-boy's clothes to change into, and a note written in High Valyrian glyphs along with a map, indicating that one of the painted panels next to her bed conceals a hidden passageway to a secret staircase. Rhaenyra changes clothes and heads down the spiral staircase, leading through the shrine of Balerion's skull to the outer wall of the Red Keep, where she meets her uncle Daemon. He leads her out for a night on the town, both of them hiding their recognizable Targaryen silver-white hair, Daemon with a hood and Rhaenyra wearing a large boy's hat.
Daemon takes Rhaenyra through a street fair, filled with tightrope-walkers, jugglers, fire-breathers, musicians, dancers, and fortune-tellers. Rhaenyra's exciting night sneaking out of the castle juxtaposes with Alicent's dreary married life: tending to her crying newborn (Helaena Targaryen), and volunteering to bathe the king's sores when the handmaids are too rough. The infection Viserys is suffering from wasn't stopped by amputating two of his fingers, only slowed, and the sores on his back are slightly worse than before.
Meanwhile, Daemon takes Rhaenyra to a street play: a cruel pantomime showing what the smallfolk really think of the current royal succession woes. A troupe of mummers farcically presents the succession choices between "the brother, the daughter, or the little princeling of three" (Daemon, Rhaenyra, and baby Aegon). The lead mummer asks the crowd if Rhaenyra will be a strong or feeble ruler, and they all shout "feeble!" to cheers and laughter. The lead mummer concludes that baby Aegon should be heir because he has two things Rhaenyra does not: "a conqueror's name, and a cock." The crowd of commoners applauds, while Rhaenyra jests that it is "lies and slander" that the prince has the latter. As they leave, Daemon says that he brought Rhaenyra to the farce to show her that most of the smallfolk are still convinced that as a male, baby Aegon has a much stronger claim to the throne than she does. Rhaenyra retorts that she doesn't care what the commoners think, but Daemon insists that she'll need to if she expects to rule them some day.
Rhaenyra says that she wants to just spend one night free of the burdens of her inheritance, not constantly reminded of them. Seeking some fun, Rhaenyra swipes some food from a street vendor and runs off without paying. Running through the alleys she is stopped by a gold cloak, but it turns out to be Ser Harwin Strong, who on closer inspection recognizes her, as well as Daemon as he rounds the corner. With a grin, Harwin tells her to take more care, and continues on his way.
At the Red Keep, Alicent is about to turn in for the night when Viserys sends a messenger to summon her to his bed. She endures boring, pleasureless sex with an ailing husband old enough to be her father. Alicent has a look of bored disinterest as they couple, though whenever Viserys does turn to her face she switches to a fake smile as a dutiful wife.
Back in the city outside the castle, Daemon takes Rhaenyra to a brothel on the Street of Silk. Rhaenyra watches a performance by naked male and female dancers, with a mix of fear and interest, and drinking wine. Daemon then leads her down into the lower level of the brothel, taking his hood off, and tossing Rhaenyra's hat aside, revealing their recognizable Valyrian hair to any onlookers. The lower den of the brothel is an orgy, with pairs and groups enjoying themselves: men cavort with women, women covert with other women, men cavort with other men, women cavort with two men at the same time while visibly enjoying themselves, and so on. Rhaenyra, a sheltered princess, is disoriented by the display all around her, but also transfixed in awe. Daemon says he brought Rhaenyra here to show her that "Fucking is a pleasure, you see - for the woman as it is the man."
After watching a particularly muscular man fellate another man, Rhaenyra can hold back her desire no longer, and leans in to start kissing her uncle Daemon. Between kisses, Daemon says that marriage may be a duty, but that doesn't stop them from doing what they want, having sex with who they want. Amidst the orgy going on around them, Rhaenyra leans in for another kiss, and Daemon slowly spins her around and holds her up against a wall. He opens up her shirt and pulls her pants down, while Rhaenyra lolls her head in pleasure. He gently turns her around to take her from behind against the wall - but then she spins around and starts aggressively kissing him. Seeing the lust in his niece's eyes, Daemon slowly starts backing down: either because he is no longer excited if he isn't in total control of the situation, or because part of him can't go through with doing this to his brother, or a mix of both.[N 1] Daemon quickly leaves, and Rhaenyra is alone at the orgy. She rushes out into the hallway and without thinking blurts out "Daemon?" as she searches for him, also not considering that she is no longer disguised. A street urchin in the hallway recognizes her.
Rhaenyra returns to the Red Keep through the front gate, in a haze of wine and lust not bothering to return through the secret passage. She comes to the door of her own chamber, which is guarded by Criston Cole. Charged up from her erotic adventures but left physically unsatisfied, Rhaenyra opens her chamber door again and playfully grabs Criston's helmet from him. She retreats back into her room and entices him to take it from her. She silently plays keep-away with it until she maneuvers herself back around to the entrance and shuts the door. Seeing the longing in her eyes and her intentions, Criston softly whispers for her to stop, as he has sworn his honor to the Kingsguard and taken a vow of chastity. Rhaenyra starts unfastening the vambrace on his left arm, and then she kisses him. Having longed after the princess from afar for years, Criston gives in to temptation and starts kissing her back. She slowly begins to remove his several layers of Kingsguard armor. After a meaningful look at the white cloak of his office after removing it, Criston and Rhaenyra both slowly undress. Rhaenyra giggles in excitement when she sees him naked, and he gently pulls down her shift until she is as well. Overcome with passion, she jumps up on Criston and locks her legs around his waist. Criston carries her to the nearby bed, and they share a night of ecstasy.
The morning after
In the pre-dawn hours, Otto Hightower is awakened by one of his guards, informing him that a messenger from the "White Worm" has come to bring him important news. It is the same street urchin that spotted Rhaenyra calling after Daemon in the brothel. Elsewhere as dawn arrives in the city, a very hung-over Daemon wakes up in an unfamiliar chamber and sees his former lover Mysaria boiling a drink. Daemon asks if he is her prisoner, to which she says that she is his protector. She gives him the drink, saying it will take the edge off his hangover, but he spills it out. Daemon groggily says he doesn't need protection from a common whore, but Mysaria says that she is no longer a whore, having learned that the "skin trade" can only take her so far in life. Mysaria is now an information broker in the city's underbelly. Then the same street urchin enters and gives Mysaria the reward money that Otto Hightower just gave to him. Mysaria leaves Daemon, who is still too hung-over to stand, casually saying as she goes that he can pay for the room on his way out.
Otto Hightower then waits outside King Viserys's private chambers, hesitating on the distasteful task he is about to do. On the one hand, Otto has always sought to undermine Daemon, and has been plotting to have Rhaenyra removed as heir in favor of his own grandson Aegon, and the news he has received could easily destroy them both without any effort on his part. On the other hand, as a father himself and having known Viserys for years, he actually takes no pleasure in giving him the awful news that his daughter apparently lost her virginity in a brothel.[N 1] Otto then knocks on the door and wakes Viserys, grudgingly reporting to him that Rhaenyra was spied at a pleasure house. This in and of itself doesn't alarm Viserys, but Otto goes on to say that she was herself "coupling" at the brothel, not just looking, and with her own uncle Daemon. Viserys is incredulous and says that it must be a lie. Otto responds that he had considered not reacting to the report of a single spy, but multiple castle servants had confirmed that they saw Rhaenyra creeping back through the main gates from the city during the pre-dawn hours, disguised as a page.
Furious, Viserys redirects his anger to accuse that Otto is so ambitious that he would have his daughter stalked with spies. Otto honestly says that he didn't: as far as he knows, one of his many informants in the city truly just happened to be at a brothel when Rhaenyra walked into it. Viserys refuses to believe it and angrily tells Otto to get out. Otto did not realize that his own daughter Alicent, however, was in the king's bed from their prior night together, and from behind a privacy screen she heard their entire conversation. Viserys was so shocked by the news that he only remembers that Alicent is still in the room after he sends her father away, and she walks out to him with tears welling in her eyes.
Rhaenyra is combing her hair in her chambers when Criston opens the door. She greets him warmly but he says the queen wishes to speak with her. Rhaenyra then meets Alicent alone in the godswood. Her voice trembling, Alicent bluntly asks what happened the last night. Rhaenyra feigns ignorance, but Alicent says that her father Otto has made worrying allegations against her: that she was "with" her uncle. Rhaenyra, almost giggling with relief, says that she hadn't seen Daemon in years so they went out for a night of fun, but other than sneaking out of the castle and drinking some wine, she didn't do anything serious. Alicent lowers her tone and curtly says that the accusation is "that you fucked Daemon in a pleasure house!" Rhaenyra says this is a vile accusation, but Alicent ponders if it is, as "you Targaryens do have queer customs." Now feigning total innocence, Rhaenyra begs Alicent as her friend and "sister" that this is a complete lie, and that as a princess to question her virtue is an act of treason. Alicent admits she doesn't know the specific source of this report, but that her father believed it enough to report it directly to the king. Rhaenyra says that she believes in slanders, but on the verge of crying, Alicent says that she only wants to help her. Rhaenyra comes around to tactfully admitting that Daemon took her to several taverns and they got very drunk, but lies that she wanted to go home when it got too late but Daemon wanted to continue, and as he was her escort she couldn't head back through the city alone, so they ended up in a brothel. Rhaenyra admits that they watched a show at the brothel, but she was "only a spectator" and didn't actually do anything herself (all of which is technically true, if only because Daemon got cold feet and left before they could have sex). Then Daemon ran off with some whore, so she had to make her way back to the castle on her own anyway. She concludes by embellishing word-for-word that "Daemon never touched me" at all and swears this on her mother's memory. Alicent knows Rhaenyra well enough to sense whether she is lying, and can tell that something is amiss, but thinks that she's fundamentally telling the truth that she didn't actually have sex with Daemon. Alicent still criticizes that Rhaenyra was foolish to go to a brothel show in the first place, to even put herself in a position where her virtue could be called into question. Alicent stresses that the king and herself have strived to find her a good match, and if any potential suitor ever thought that she had been "sullied," it would ruin any potential marriage-alliance, which they need now more than ever.
Second exile
Still several hours later, a somewhat more sober Daemon lopes through the gates of the Red Keep, only to be immediately seized by Harrold Westerling and two other Kingsguard, to bring him to an audience with the king. The guards roughly drop the still semi-coherent Daemon onto the floor of the throne room. The guards leave, then Viserys appears from a side doorway. He accuses that Daemon defiled his daughter and gives him a swift kick in the ribs, asking if he will even attempt to deny it. Daemon does not, instead asking why this matters given that when the two of them were Rhaenyra's age, they visited most of the brothels on the Street of Silk. Viserys responds that they were young men, but Rhaenyra is just a girl. Daemon counters that Rhaenyra is legally a "woman grown," and half-sarcastically says that it's better that her first experience is with him than some random whore, thus lying to Viserys that he actually had sex with her. Angered, Viserys kneels down and starts strangling Daemon, proclaiming that he has ruined her, as no lord will wed her now in this condition. Daemon brazenly says that he will wed her. Viserys stifles a laugh at the absurdity, as Daemon is already married to Rhea Royce. Daemon says he'll just take a second wife, polygamously, like Aegon the Conqueror did. Viserys is so insulted that he immediately draws his Valyrian steel dagger and holds it to Daemon's throat, kneeling on his chest, and says that he is no conqueror, but a plague upon their house. Daemon continues to insist that if Viserys gives him Rhaenyra, together they will restore House Targaryen to its proper glory. Viserys bitterly accuses that it's not Rhaenyra that Daemon wants, but the Iron Throne. Viserys rises, and dismissively tells Daemon to go back to the Vale and his lawful wife, and to try to restore what scrap of honor he may have left; or not, it makes no difference to him, as he never wants to see Daemon again.
In his chambers, a rattled Viserys looks out from his balcony over the city while Alicent brings him a cup of wine. Alicent says that she talked with Rhaenyra: she denied having sex with Daemon, and isn't known for being deceitful. More importantly, Alicent points out, Daemon pervasively lies, so openly claiming to have had sex with Rhaenyra means it probably isn't true. Viserys is baffled at how claiming such things could possibly serve him, to which Alicent suggests that Daemon's entire goal was just to taunt his older brother for disinheriting him. Viserys says that whatever happened, he can still sense that Rhaenyra is not innocent of any wrongdoing. Alicent earnestly insists that Rhaenyra swore to her that she remains a maiden, and she believes her.
The interests of the realm
That evening, Rhaenyra is summoned to her father's chambers and the guards are told to leave. Viserys has been heating his Valyrian steel dagger in a brazier of fire. He explains that the dagger was carried by Aegon the Conqueror, and generations before him by Aenar Targaryen when he left Valyria. Before Aegon the Conqueror died, Viserys explains, when he realized that the apocalyptic winter he saw in his dragon dream would not happen in his own lifetime, he sought to pass the warning on to future generations of their dynasty: in addition to passing the story down from king to heir, Aegon himself also commissioned the last of the old Valyrian pyromancers to etch a hidden message onto his personal dagger, only visible when it is heated red-hot. He hands the heated dagger to Rhaenyra, who reads off the High Valyrian glyphs on it: from my blood come the Prince That Was Promised, and his will be the Song of Ice and Fire.
Viserys says that the responsibility he has handed to Rhaenyra, the burden of this knowledge, is larger than the throne or herself, or her desires. Viserys says that Jaehaerys would have disinherited her, but he does not have that luxury. She says that she hasn't been given a chance to defend herself, but he replies that the truth doesn't matter: the perception of it does. Enough people have already heard the gossip that she was at least sighted in a brothel with Daemon that they are willing to entertain the rumor that she actually had sex with him there. Rhaenyra defiantly says that if she were born a man, she could bed whomever she wanted, father a dozen bastards and no one in the royal court would bat an eye. Viserys bluntly says that she's right, but she was born a woman, which means she cannot.
Viserys explains that he would disinherit Rhaenyra and name Aegon heir in her place, but his duty is to hold the realm together (should the White Walkers ever return). They are on the verge of civil war with House Velaryon, and he needs a marriage-alliance between their families to unite them back with the rest of the realm. He commands Rhaenyra to marry Corlys's son Laenor Velaryon, and Lord Corlys will not accept the match if Rhaenyra is anything less than the named heir to the Iron Throne.
Rhaenyra agrees to do this without protest only on one condition: that Viserys removes Otto Hightower as Hand of the King. Not only has Otto slighted Rhaenyra now, but Rhaenyra points out that he has always been pushing for his grandson Aegon to be named heir to the Iron Throne. If Aegon was named heir it would ruin Rhaenyra's marriage-alliance through Laenor, which Viserys is so focused on obtaining, so as long as Otto remains Hand, he will always try to undermine peace with the Velaryons. Viserys at first scoffs that every lord on his council is self-interested somehow, but Rhaenyra insists that Otto is so self-interested that he would indeed jeopardize the stability of the realm in his goal to put an heir with Hightower blood on the throne. While reluctant, Viserys has not been blind to Otto's constant attempts at manipulation over the years, and he grudgingly relents.
Some time later, Otto Hightower is summoned to meet Viserys alone in the Small Council chamber. Viserys immediately launches into the story of how his own father, Baelon Targaryen, served as Hand of the King for only five days. Baelon was a healthy warrior and dragon-rider in the prime of his life when Old King Jaehaerys named him as the new Hand of the King, but a mere five days later he suddenly died of a burst belly. Baelon was then replaced as Hand by Otto himself, who has held the office ever since. In only five days, Otto went from just another man in the royal court to the second most powerful man in the realm, and Viserys wonders how long it took Otto to start choosing his own interests over those of his king. Viserys says that Alicent did get him through the worst of his grief after Aemma died, but he realizes now just how much Otto intended her as a "calculated distraction" so the Hightowers could subsume his reign from within. Otto pleads that this is absurd, and he knows that Viserys and Alicent love each other. Viserys doesn't deny this, but says that Otto's interests no longer align with those of the realm. Pained, Viserys says that the crown and the realm owe Otto a great debt that can never be repaid, but he can no longer trust his judgement. Saying this, he takes Otto's pin of office as Hand off of his tunic.
Rhaenyra's tea
Late at night, Rhaenyra is reading alone in her chambers when Grand Maester Mellos arrives. He presents her with a round sealed jar containing a liquid and says that he took great care in brewing it, because if prepared improperly it can be ineffective or have negative side effects. When she asks what it is, he says that it is a tea - sent from the king. Mellos tells Rhaenyra that "it will rid you of any unwanted consequences." then bows and leaves. Rhaenyra has been presented with moon tea, an abortifacient, meaning that her father either didn't believe her or wasn't sure to believe her when she insisted that she didn't have sex with her uncle Daemon. She actually did have premarital sex, but with Criston Cole. Rhaenyra stares at the tea.

Behind the scenes
General
- The title of the episode refers to Daemon, who is hailed as "King of the Narrow Sea" after his victory over the Triarchy.
- In the World of Westeros as a whole, this is the first episode to have a female director (Clare Kilner) since 2014, in Season 4's fifth episode, "First of His Name" (which was directed by Michelle MacLaren). The last four seasons of Game of Thrones had no female directors, and after Season 3 had no female screenwriters either. MacLaren was also the only female director who ever worked on Game of Thrones.
Filming locations
Filming locations for this episode included:
- The extensive street scenes during Rhaenyra and Daemon's night out at a street carnival were all filmed in Cáceres, Spain. The town had previously been used for some King's Landing street scenes starting in Season 7. Because these were night scenes, the production team obtained permission from the town council to order all electric lights turned off in a certain neighborhood.[2]
- The hall of Storm's End was not just an interior location but filmed entirely on the "Volume" virtual set. None of the walls were real. To enhance the illusion that it was a real set director Clare Kilner had dead leaves scattered around the ground, then gently blown around with fans to simulate wind.[2]
At Storm's End
- This episode features the first on-screen appearance of Storm's End, the seat of House Baratheon. If not for budget constraints, Storm's End would have appeared in the second season of Game of Thrones, during the parley between Renly and Stannis. It would also have appeared later in the series, in a subplot from A Dance with Dragons and The Winds of Winter that was cut from the series.
- The taunting and subsequent bloody duel between Willem Blackwood and Jerrel Bracken reflects the bitter enmity between the houses, a longstanding feud which began during the Age of Heroes and endures to the War of the Five Kings, even when these houses happen to fight on the same side. Fire & Blood mentions that King Jaehaerys was such a skilled negotiator that he even managed to broker a peace between the two families that lasted for fifty years, but it ultimately didn't last - apparently broken by the duel at Storm's End.
- Fire & Blood does mention that a Blackwood and a Bracken fought a duel over Rhaenyra at Storm's End, but it was the Bracken who won the fight, and no one died in it. Also in the book the Blackwood was named Samwell, not Willem, and he does appear again as an adult after the time skip: it's unclear if he's meant to be the same character, or if the writers simply didn't want to re-use the name "Samwell".
- As Willem Blackwood mentions, the Blackwoods sided with the Targaryens during the War of Conquest. The Riverlands were being brutally oppressed by the ironborn after they conquered the region three generations before, so House Tully rallied the Riverlords to voluntarily switch to the Targaryens' side. In reward, the Riverlands were given equal standing with the rest of the kingdoms (as the Riverlands had been a contested border region for centuries and not considered one of the "Seven" Kingdoms). Jerrel mocks Willem for citing the Blackwoods' contribution as somehow special, because all of the Riverlords joined the Targaryens, including the Brackens, and the Tullys actually had a bigger impact. The name of the Lord Blackwood who sided with the Targaryen Conquest isn't mentioned in the book, but this episode establishes that his name was Lucas Blackwood.
- Boremund Baratheon notes that the Blackwoods are a strong house who descend from the First Men, the original human ethnic group in Westeros (loosely based on the Celts). The Blackwoods are actually the most prominent family outside of the North who never converted to the Faith of the Seven, but still follow the Old Gods of the Forest.
- Stunt coordinator Rowley Irlam explained that the Blackwood and Bracken actors didn't use stunt doubles in their brief fight, nor were there mats on the ground to cushion their falls. Irlam redesigned the fight a few times before the final version. Though most of it happens off-screen in the final cut, it is shown in the "House That Dragons Built" behind the scenes featurette.[2]
- Among the potential suitors for Rhaenyra are representatives from House Dondarrion, House Bracken, House Blackwood, House Frey, House Mooton, House Strong, House Swann, and House Mudd.
- The fish sigil is not a Tully sigil, though several reviewers mistook it for one. The Tully fish is smaller trout and the head is facing left: the Mooton sigil's fish is a larger salmon, leaping in a different pose and facing to the right.
- The presence of a man displaying a House Mudd sigil is odd, given that they were local kings of the First Men in the Riverlands who died out thousands of years ago during the Andal Invasion. Then again, there are several minor mercenaries in the Free Cities who use the surname "Mudd", who might be from minor branches of the family that survived.
- According to the credits, the elderly Lord Dondarrion is actually named "Beric Dondarrion": names repeat in dynasties, so the implication is that it was repeated for his descendant "Beric Dondarrion" of the Brotherhood Without Banners. Given that he says he hosted Queen Alysanne at Blackhaven half a century ago, it's possible that this is the same Lord Dondarrion that Criston Cole served under for a year fighting Dornish incursions along the Boneway.
- Costume Designer Jany Temime explained the thought that went into Rhaenyra's new red gown: she is looking for a husband now, so it shows a little more skin with open sleeves and bare shoulders; Temime says this is "a little too old" for her. At the same time, Temime notes that this inviting and alluring outfit is an intentional contrast with how she's acting, brutally honest and shunning every suitor.[2]
- All four tiers of the nobility in Westeros are all present in one scene at Storm's End: at the top is Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen (from the royal family), then Boremund Baratheon (Lord Paramount of the Stormlands), then Lord Dondarrion of Blackhaven (one of the dozen or so major lords in each of the Seven Kingdoms), and then Criston of House Cole (a minor noble family who serve as stewards to the Dondarrions).
- As Rhaenyra grows more bored and frustrated with the suitors she once again plays with the rings on her fingers, twisting them around. This is one of Rhaenyra's character tics described in the book.
- Criston Cole mentions that Rhaenyra's royal tour was meant to continue on to Bitterbridge, marking the first time it has been mentioned in dialogue in the franchise. Bitterbridge guards a major crossing over the Mander River in the Reach, controlling all east-west passage along the Roseroad from Oldtown and Highgarden to King's Landing.
In King's Landing
- Rhaenyra's boat set was filmed on a blue-screen lot. It is not a full-sized war galley but a smaller "yacht". Ryan Condal said the idea behind it is that it is a fast, small pleasure yacht meant for personal travel shuttling back and forth across Blackwater Bay, as much of the story in Season 1 involves characters shuttling back and forth between King's Landing and Dragonstone (and nearby Driftmark). Storm's End isn't much farther away, farther down the east coast. It isn't a large war ship meant for travel on the open seas. It wasn't too expensive to build because not only is it a smaller ship but they only constructed about the rear third of the vessel, the parts they'd actually need to show actors walking around on. The design team pointed out that they only really had one ship set on Game of Thrones, which they redressed as best they could to simulate different vessels, so they knew that design on this new pleasure yacht was important because it would be extensively re-used as the show progresses into future seasons. [2]
- When the royal court is gathering to receive Daemon, Viserys noticeably reacts with surprise when Rhaenyra tries to sneak in with the crowd: she didn't send advance word that she was returning early from her royal tour, and she didn't have time to meet her father yet because everyone is rushing to receive Daemon, so this is the first moment that Viserys learns his daughter is back in the city.
- The full royal courtroom scene includes 250 extras in full costume.[2]
- During the garden party in the godswood, Rhaenyra is seen picking off and eating the candied lemon topping from a lemon cake: notice that quite a few of the cakes in the tray are missing their topping, implying that Rhaenyra picked the candied lemons off all of them before the scene began.
- Originally, the scene between Rhaenyra and Daemon privately talking at the garden party was supposed to take place entirely under the weirwood heart tree. Director Clare Kilner later decided that if the whole scene stayed there, viewers would be distracted by the impressive heart tree prop instead of focusing on the actors' nuanced performance, so she changed it to have Daemon walk over to one of the feast tables along the side colonnade and jauntily sit with his feet up.[2]
- The specific face sculpt that was used for the Red Keep godswood's heart tree is based on the face of Miguel Sapochnik's mother.[2]
- Production Designer Jim Clay explained that Red Keep godswood set is inspired by a "Byzantine" style atrium or prayer space in terms of the brickwork, tree at the center, and artwork on the walls - though instead of Byzantine frescoes he gave it a "Renaissance" quality by using murals instead of mosaics.[2]
- Consider this in context of earlier comments that Rhaenyra's investiture robe at the end of the first episode is also a "Byzantine"-inspired design, and it is intended to be a relic passed down from the Conquest-era Targaryens. The Red Keep and its godswood were built during the later reign of the Conquest-era Targaryens as well (the time of Aegon I's son Maegor). The implication is that the Conquest-era Targaryens had an overall Byzantine-inspired aesthetic, from clothing styles to architecture. Although it hasn't been stated, also note that the Dragonpit (also built by Maegor) is a great dome not unlike the Hagia Sophia.
- Rhaenyra is no longer just a cupbearer at the Small Council but has a formal seat at the table: looking closely, she even has her own rounded stone ball and plate like the other members, to mark when the council is in session.
- Daemon reveals in his note to Rhaenyra that there is a secret passageway in her chambers: a wall panel on the right side of her bed opens up to a staircase leading down to the shrine for Balerion's skull. The Red Keep is filled with secret passageways, built on the order of Maegor the Cruel when the castle was constructed (and after they were finished he executed all the builders so they couldn't reveal them to others). It was already shown in the first episode that Daemon knows the secret passageways, as he used them to spy on the Small Council when they were discussing the succession crisis after Queen Aemma died.
- As Rhaenyra makes her way through the shrine of Balerion's skull, rats are seen scurrying by; the scene then intercuts with Alicent seeing a rat on her bedpost. The Red Keep has something of a rat problem, because they can retreat into the secret passageways to avoid traps and cats. It is a subtle hint that any room a rat can be seen in is a room where spies might be hiding behind the walls.
- The street carnival that Daemon and Rhaenyra walk through was filmed in Cáceres, Spain, which was previously used for some King's Landing scenes in Game of Thrones Season 7. Production did not return to the iconic city walls of Dubrovnik, Croatia, which featured in Game of Thrones from Season 2 onward. Miguel Sapochnik explained that they chose to focus on Cáceres because it is smaller than Dubronik: this is a prequel era 200 years before the original TV series, so logically the buildings of King's Landing should look smaller in an earlier era.[2]
- Cinematographer Alejandro Martínez explained that production asked the town council to turn off all electric lights in the neighborhood where they were filming, so they would have total control over how it was lit. In theory, the series only uses natural light sources that exist within the fictional universe, which should be just three things: the sun, the moon, and fire. A key distinction is that in practice, this doesn't mean that they literally film in near-darkness, but that they think up justifications for strong in-universe light sources - i.e. they still set up artificial overhead lights, but under the conceit that the in-universe moon isn't obscured by clouds on this particular night, or torches are lighting scenes a little more intensely than they would in real life. For this episode, they took it a step forward by establishing that many of the street performers are doing tricks with bonfires, creating bursts of flame. The real bonfires on their own aren't actually powerful enough to fully illuminate Daemon and Rhaenyra, so out-of-universe they supplement them with lighting rigs that simulate the effect that bursts of flame would have. Luckily they already had such rigs easily on hand, as a "dragon breath lighting rig" has already been developed for when characters are standing next to blasts of dragon-fire.[2]
- Instead of just having a few static shots of Daemon and Rhaenyra standing around a street festival, the production team wanted it to be a chaotic, almost overwhelming journey from Rhaenyra's POV, with the camera shaking and moving as it follows her. This was filmed by having multiple cameramen wearing steadicam rigs follow her around. For example, when Rhaenyra runs around a corner and encounters Harwin Strong in an alley, the camera isn't motionless and positioned at the other end of the street: a cameraman with a steadicam rig is running backwards a few feet ahead of Milly Alcock, moving along with her.[2]
- Rhaenyra and Daemon watch a lowbrow pantomime performance by a troupe of mummers (actors) in the streets of King's Landing. In the books, Samwell Tarly notes that only the Free Cities have actual "theatres" with full-length scripted narratives and professional actors, while in Westeros there are just simple street farces, filled with stock characters. Notice that the players appearing as Rhaenyra and Alicent as both men in dresses. The wooden prop version of the Iron Throne that they use also doubles as a toilet, with a lid on the seat.
- Director Clare Kilner said of the street farce: ""I wanted to do it in the vein of an English pantomime - dress the men up with women, and we had a lot of fun with that. So we rehearsed that and we put together this little story on stage which was all about mocking Daemon and Rhaenyra. Then we built the throne and I decided it would be fun if it was also a toilet."[2]
- Rhaenyra has several parallels with Arya Stark in this episode: Arya snuck through a secret passageway past a dragon skull to escape the Red Keep and dressed as a boy to avoid detection. Several years later in Braavos, Arya also saw a "show-within-the-show" stage play named The Bloody Hand, satirizing the events of earlier seasons (though Rhaenyra watches an even more ribald and poorly written street farce). Milly Alcock explained that the placeholder dialogue that the producers gave for the "Young Rhaenyra" audition was actually re-used lines from Arya Stark, indicating they do see similarities between the characters (both of them chafe against the restrictions put on them because of their gender).
- The episode begins with a closeup of Rhaenyra playing with the Valyrian steel necklace that her uncle Daemon gave her, but notice that after he rejects her and she has sex with Criston Cole instead, in subsequence scenes Rhaenyra has stopped wearing Daemon's necklace and switched to a different one.
- When Daemon is sprawled out drunk on the throne room floor, notice that he still has a faint scar on his right collarbone from where he was wounded by a flaming arrow about a year ago in the preceding episode.
- During the confrontation with Viserys, Daemon points out that Aegon the Conqueror had two wives, and questions why he can't. This is the second time he's half-seriously suggested having a polygamous second marriage: the first time was in the second episode when he said he would marry Mysaria. In both cases Viserys refuses, because he is already married to Rhea Royce. It was uncommon, but not unheard of, for Valyrians to practice polygamy. Aegon I married his older sister Visenya (many suspect just to secure his succession) but then also married his younger sister Rhaenys out of love. The Faith of the Seven was opposed to both Targaryen incest and polygamy, but Aegon gave their leadership the tacit assurance that these were relics of their past which wouldn't continue now that they were ruling over Westeros. The Faith Militant uprising broke out in the time of Aegon I's sons over both the issues of Targaryen polygamy and incest, and actually ended in the Faith giving them an exception to continue their incestuous practices. No official ruling, however, was given on continuing their polygamy. The Targaryens couldn't avoid that they already had an incestuous bloodline, but actively choosing to take multiple wives agains would have restarted conflict with the Faith. Even though there was no official ban on Targaryen polygamy, therefore, by tradition they never tried to do it again. Every few generations a particularly brazen Targaryen (like Maegor the Cruel) would attempt to claim this ancient custom, but it was always scandalous: the rumors that Daemon Blackfyre and later Rhaegar Targaryen felt they could marry second wives. Daemon never explicitly claims in Fire & Blood that he can take a second wife while still married to Rhea Royce but this is in keeping with examples of other rebellious Targaryens who thought they might flout the restriction.
- Given that Rhea later says in "We Light the Way" that their marriage was never even consummated, it isn't explained why Daemon didn't seek an annulment: one of the few grounds for dissolving a marriage (i.e. Tyrion and Sansa's marriage). Fire & Blood does mention that Daemon indeed requested that Viserys annul his marriage as soon as he became the king, but refused for unclear reasons. It's possible that Viserys didn't want to offend House Royce, or that he hoped chaining Daemon to Rhea would keep him out of trouble (but it didn't work).
- Rhaenyra apparently has a handmaiden named "Annara", who she thinks is at the door to her chamber only for Criston to enter. As a princess, Rhaenyra has several handmaidens in the books but only one of them is named: the "youngest" of them, Elinda Massey (who will appear later this season).
- When Rhaenyra holds the Valyrian steel dagger in fire, Valyrian glyphs are revealed, these spell: "From my blood come the Prince That Was Promised, and his will be the Song of Ice and Fire"; these are almost the same words Rhaegar Targaryen said about his son Aegon in a vision Daenerys saw at the House of the Undying (A Clash of Kings, chapter 48): "He is the Prince That Was Promised, and his is the song of ice and fire".
- This is the first time that the phrase "the Prince That Was Promised" has been mentioned in the series, as Viserys didn't say it when he first revealed the prophecy in the first episode.
- It is the second time the phrase "the Song of Ice and Fire" is mentioned in the show, following "The Heirs of the Dragon".
- The second part of Rhaegar's enigmatic words "There must be one more, the dragon has three heads" is not included in the hidden glyphs.
Targaryen ancestors
This episode prominently mentions Viserys's parents and grandparents:
- Lord Dondarrion tries to impress Rhaenyra with a story of how Queen Alysanne Targaryen visited his castle half a century ago, and Rhaenyra points out that she was her great-grandmother. This is the first time in the franchise that Queen Alysanne's name has been mentioned in dialogue. Viserys did mention in the first episode of this series that public order in King's Landing had declined since "my grandmother" died - her death left her brother-husband Jaehaerys a shell of the man he used to be, and he died a few years later.
- At the garden party, Viserys recalls that Daemon was always their mother's favorite, as like him she was a warrior who didn't care about tradition or rules. He doesn't mention her name, Alyssa Targaryen, though both of Viserys's parents are listed on the scroll that King Jaehaerys reads in the first episode. This description matches her personality as described in Fire & Blood: a tomboy and dragon-rider herself, she was the former rider of Meleys, the current mount of Rhaenys.
- When Viserys dismisses Otto as Hand, he shares at length the story of his father Baelon Targaryen's death, which is straight from the books. Baelon was a great warrior and dragon-rider in the prime of his life, but he suddenly died of a burst appendix. Septon Barth had been Hand for forty years, but he died of old age late in Jaehaerys's reign. Ryam Redwyne served as an interrim Hand of the King for less than a year but was so infamously bad at it that he voluntarily resigned to return to his position on the Kingsguard. Jaehaerys then replaced him by naming Baelon as the new Hand, given that he was also the royal heir at this point (his older brother Aemon's daughter Rhaenys having been passed over). Jaehaerys declared a great hunt in the Kingswood to celebrate his appointment, but while there Baelon complained of a pain in his side, and despite the best efforts of the maesters he died only five days after being named Hand (one year according to Fire & Blood). Baelon's death is what sparked the succession crisis that resulted in the Great Council of 101 AC seen in the prelude to the first episode. In the first episode, Viserys also named his infant son who only lived a few hours "Baelon", though the episode didn't explain in dialogue that Viserys named him after his father.
- Viserys also mentions that his father Baelon was specifically the rider of no less a mount than Vhagar, last of the original three Targaryen dragons from the War of Conquest and the largest left alive. Vhagar was originally the mount of Queen Visenya Targaryen, who lived to be almost 80 years old but died a few years before her son Maegor did. Vhagar was left riderless for decades after that, until she was eventually claimed by Jaehaerys's second son Baelon. Vhagar has been left riderless again ever since Baelon's death, and as Viserys discussed with Laena Velaryon two episodes ago, she has been nesting around Dragonstone and nearby isles like Driftmark.
Viserys also explains that his Valyrian steel dagger used to belong to Aegon I Targaryen, grandfather of Viserys's grandfather Jaehaerys. Aegon had a warning from his prophetic dream etched into the blade (only visible when it is heated red hot), but Viserys goes on to say that before that the blade was in the family since the time of Aenar Targaryen. Aenar was the father of Daenys the Dreamer, who Viserys mentioned when he first introduced the prophecy in the first episode. Daenys had prophetic dreams about the coming Doom of Valyria, which her father Aenar took heed of, resettling their entire house on Dragonstone - and thus they survived the volcanic super-eruption that destroyed their homeland a dozen years later. Seven generations of Targaryens lived on Dragonstone between the Doom and the Conquest, counting Aenar as the first and Aegon the Conqueror as the seventh. So the blade has been in their family for at least eleven generations. Viserys also admits that he doesn't know if Aenar was the first person the dagger belonged to, because before that it is difficult to know: Aenar is the oldest Targaryen ancestor mentioned by name in the novels, and other than the general detail that they were dragon-lords no further information has been given about them in that era.
Free Cities
This episode mentions several of the Free Cities:
- The defeated Triarchy is mentioned, actually a triple-alliance between Myr, Lys, and Tyrosh (so far the TV show has mentioned Myr and Lys as being part of the Triarchy).
- Norvos and Qohor are mentioned for the first time in this series, when Alicent says that they have fine new tapestries from those cities on display in the gallery. Free Cities known for their tapestries include Norvos, Qohor, Lys, and Myr - but they probably wouldn't get new tapestries from Lys and Myr due to the recent war with the Triarchy. The World of Ice & Fire sourcebook says that Qohor actually makes tapestries that are the same quality as those made in Myr, but they are considerably cheaper because they aren't as famous (i.e. similar to how sparkling wine from the Champagne region of France is much more prestigious and expensive than sparkling wine from other regions even if they are technically of nearly the same quality). In the first novel A Game of Thrones, Eddard Stark observes that there are tapestries from Norvos, Qohor, and Lys hanging in the Small Council chamber.
- Braavos is mentioned for the first time in this series, and not as a stray reference but part of the plot, as Viserys's Small Council learns that Corlys Velaryon is seeking a marriage pact between his daughter Laena and the son of the Sealord of Braavos.
- Two episodes ago in "The Rogue Prince", Viserys also mentioned seeking alliances with Pentos and Volantis against the Triarchy. Thus as of this episode mentioning another three, eight out of the nine Free Cities have been mentioned in House of the Dragon (all except for Lorath, generally considered the most remote and least important of the nine).
High Valyrian glyph writing
This episode marks the introduction of the High Valyrian glyph writing system, developed by linguist David J. Peterson who also developed the spoken languages for the TV series. He has developed writing systems for other SciFi & Fantasy series but this is the first writing system he has developed for the World of Westeros franchise. Peterson is continuing to give updates over social media as House of the Dragon progresses expalining how the glyph system works. The books mention that Valyrian has a "glyph"-based writing system, but George R.R. Martin made no attempt to develop it.
Peterson said that the High Valyrian writing system is intentionally complicated, and inspired by Egyptian hieroglyphs: it is a mixture of both ideographs and characters representing sounds, and even the characters aren't a full alphabet but an abjad (signifying only consonants and a few vowel clusters, leaving most vowels to context). The glyphs most prominently appear when Rhaenyra reads them aloud off the Valyrian steel dagger, but they first appear (very clearly) on the note that Daemon left in Rhaenyra's room.
Peterson made a post on Instagram giving the transcription and translation of Daemon's note:[3]
- Kesommi aōle mīsās. (Put these on).
- Rhakiāzmo inkot dōros indīs. (Push the wall behind the tapestry).
- Geltilio rȳ jās. (Follow the passage).
- Ninkiot avy rhaeninna. (I'll meet you outside).
Timeline
- As Aegon is three years old in this episode, a year has passed since "Second of His Name". Rhaenyra was stated to be 17 years old last episode, so this would make her 18 years old in this episode. It's also directly stated that four years have passed since Daemon left King's Landing, and she was 14 years old in the premiere.
- Alicent Hightower was heavily pregnant with her next child in the previous episode, but the baby has since been born and is almost a year old: her daughter Helaena Targaryen.
- The age of adulthood in Westeros is 16, as noted in the preceding episode. Daemon points out to Viserys that Rhaenyra is "a woman grown" during their confrontation. Alicent married Viserys several months after the second episode, around the time she would have turned 16 as well. Due to UK filming laws, a character younger than 16 cannot be depicted as having sex (or by implication, through being married); Game of Thrones similarly had to age-up Daenerys Targaryen so she was 16 years old in its first season.
- This episode confirms that Otto Hightower served for some time as Hand of the King under King Jaehaerys I Targaryen before his grandson Viserys succeeded him. In the books, Jaehaerys lived for another two years after the Great Council of 101 AC.
- The Great Council was in the year 101 AC, and the TV series begins in the ninth year of Viserys's reign, when in the books Queen Aemma died in the second year of his reign. Adding in Jaehaerys's two year reign, the first episode began in the year 112 AC of the TV-Timeline (101 + 2 + 9 = 112), also confirmed by supplementary material.[4] This episode is four years later, meaning it takes place in the year 116 AC. This also matches up with the preceding episode, stated to take place one year before, which also worked out with internal dialogue to take place in 115 AC.
- Otto says that Rhaenyra was spotted sneaking back into the Red Keep during the "Hour of the Owl": this continues from the mention of the "Hour of the Bat" two episodes ago. Westeros has a system of customary names for each hour of the night, though a full listing hasn't been given yet. It is known that the Hour of the Bat is followed by the Hour of the Eel, which is followed by the Hour of Ghosts. At some point later in the night is the Hour of the Owl, which is followed by the Hour of the Wolf (the darkest point in the middle of the night - i.e. around midnight), and then the Hour of the Nightingale.
Unreliable historical sources
Rhaenyra's activities in this episode prominently bring up the issue of the "unreliable narrator" in the source material. House of the Dragon is based on Fire & Blood, which George R.R. Martin wrote as an in-universe history book. Martin has said he is fascinated by having conflicting points of view between different POV characters in the main novel series: because Fire & Blood didn't have POV narration, the way he worked in this element of uncertainty was that the in-universe text is written by a much later historian, Archmaester Gyldayn, living over a century after these events and who has to sort through biased historical sources written by those who lived through it. There are several points where these sources drastically diverge, so Gyldayn simply presents each version and leaves it to the reader to figure out what really happened. As Martin said, real-life historians have to deal with biased sources to sort out the truth.
Gyldayn's history text presented in Fire & Blood relies on three major sources: Grand Maester Munkun's pro-Rhaenyra account, Septon Eustace's anti-Rhaenyra account, and the ribald account of the court jester Mushroom (who took no side but invented many salacious details that probably didn't happen). Showrunner Ryan Condal said it would be impossible to present all three alternate versions, so House of the Dragon is trying to present what "really" happened between the three versions, before they got distorted by rival chroniclers and rumor. This is particularly evident when the sources don't discuss army movements or actions in open court, but secondhand rumors of what characters did in private behind closed doors.
In Fire & Blood, the three major sources diverge on how Daemon was exiled for a second time and how Rhaenyra lost her virginity:
- Grand Maester Munkun simply says that Viserys and Daemon quarreled again, leading to his exile. As the pro-Rhaenyra account, it avoids discussing the matter in detail (thus there are really only two alternate versions, Eustace and Mushroom).
- Septon Eustace, the anti-Rhaenyra account, says that Daemon had sex with Rhaenyra: not in a brothel, but that he was found in bed with her in her own castle chambers by one of the Kingsguard. Eustace claims Rhaenyra was in love with Daemon and pleaded with her father to let her marry him but was refused. Eustace goes on to say that right before Rhaenyra's wedding to Laenor, Criston snuck into Rhaenyra's chambers to plead his love to her and suggest that they run away to the Free Cities and get married there, but she refused to join him in exile.
- Mushroom, the dwarf court jester, gives an utterly ribald account: he claims that Rhaenyra wanted Criston more than Daemon, but he never approached her due to his vows of chastity as a Kingsguard. Daemon then took advantage of this by telling Rhaenyra he could teach her how to seduce Criston, and Mushroom claims he took her to brothels so she could watch experienced prostitutes and "learn the art of pleasing a man". Mushroom goes on to say Rhaenyra practiced having oral sex on Daemon, but kept her maidenhead/virginity for Criston. Yet, Mushroom claims, when Rhaenyra attempted to put these new skills into practice and seduce Criston, he was horrified and spurned her. Mushroom goes on to say that Rhaenyra tried to seduce Criston a second time right before her wedding to Laenor Velaryon, but he rejected her again, and by chance on the way back she stumbled into Harwin Strong, who she then had sex with (losing her virginity). When word reached Viserys of these events, Daemon suggested that Viserys let him marry Rhaenyra because no other lord would have her now in her sullied condition - which may have been what Daemon was planning the entire time.
The version of events in House of the Dragon is somewhere between the rumors in the in-universe historical sources:
- Daemon took Rhaenyra to a brothel in an attempt to seduce her but stopped at the last minute. Daemon then falsely claimed to Viserys that he had sex with Rhaenyra, and she was therefore "sullied", so Viserys should let him marry her (when it was Harwin who did the sullying in Mushroom's version). This is implied to be what he was planning the entire time.
- Rhaenyra happened to run into Harwin Strong while he was making his rounds as a Gold Cloak in the city streets while out with Daemon, but he just told them both to be careful and went on his way.
- In Mushroom's version, Rhaenyra had sex with Harwin Strong after Criston Cole spurned her. In the TV show version, Rhaenyra has sex with Criston Cole after Daemon spurned her. Neither Eustace nor Mushroom ever claim that Rhaenyra succeeded in having sex with Criston.
- None of the three sources ever suggest that Viserys sent Rhaenyra Moon tea, a medicinal tea that induces abortion, after learning she lost her virginity in pre-marital sex. This could have happened, but something so private would logically not have been known by the three major chroniclers. It is, however, common for noblemen to give their wayward daughters moon tea in order to avoid the scandal of giving birth to a bastard. Moon tea is mentioned only once in Fire & Blood itself, when it is said that prostitutes take it to abort unwanted children.
- Several reviewers expressed confusion at why Viserys didn't simply confirm Rhaenyra's claim that she was still a virgin by ordering his maesters or septas to examine if her hymen was still physically intact. This is actually a cultural point in the books: in their medieval society, it is very common for noblewomen to break their hymens while horseback riding, so when a new bride claims to be a virgin her husband generally just has to take her word for it (for that reason, in the real world, in the past women prefered to travel in carriages or use a sidesaddle).
- While Cersei considers how to dispose of Margaery by accusing her of adultery, she receives reports from the maesters that Margaery's maidenhead (hymen) is broken, but even Cersei - who hates Margaery and of all people would grasp at the flimsiest accusations to throw against her - dismisses that this alone isn't useful evidence, because most noblewomen break their maidenheads from horseback riding, and Renly could have bedded her. Later, after Margaery and her cousins are examined by septas, based on the testimonies of Osney Kettleblack and other false witnesses, it is publicly announced that they are not virgins, and are arrested for adultery. Listening to the verbal commotion, Cersei gloatingly thinks "I do hope the little queen and her cousins enjoyed those rides of theirs" (A Feast for Crows, Cersei VI, X).
- Several reviewers expressed confusion at why Viserys didn't simply confirm Rhaenyra's claim that she was still a virgin by ordering his maesters or septas to examine if her hymen was still physically intact.

The TV version also plays on the idea that Daemon planned all these events: notice that Daemon intentionally takes Rhaenyra's hat off in the brothel, as well as his own hood, knowing that they would be recognized there. Daemon knows that as Hand of the King, Otto Hightower has access to numerous spies throughout the city, and one of these street urchins indeed notices them and brings the information to Otto. It is later revealed that the street urchin was working for Mysaria. It is ambiguous, however, whether Mysaria was in league with Daemon or with Otto: she does manage to provide damaging information on Daemon and Rhaenyra (which Otto would want), but the information is so damaging that it makes Otto seem too ambitious, leading to his dismissal (which Daemon would want).

Premise
Ten years later. Rhaenyra navigates Alicent's continued speculation about her children, while Daemon and Laena weigh an offer in Pentos.
Synopsis
Ten years later, at the Red Keep
Ten years after Rhaenyra Targaryen's wedding to Laenor Velaryon, she gives birth to her third son. Just after the baby is delivered a handmaid brings the message that Queen Alicent Hightower has commanded that it be brought to her "immediately". Determined not to let Alicent shame her, Rhaenyra rises and commands her handmaids to dress her, even though it's another minute until she expels the afterbirth from her. Laenor then enthusiastically enters, only to find the exhausted Rhaenyra insisting that she will walk across the entire castle personally holding her baby to show the queen. Laenor at least manages to convince her to let him take her by the arm to steady her.
After arduously making her way across the Red Keep and up a flight of stairs while still experiencing post-birth muscle spasms, Rhaenyra reaches Alicent's private chambers. Rhaenyra and Laenor give cold, silent glances to Criston Cole as he stands guard outside the door. With false politeness, Alicent expresses concern that Rhaenyra shouldn't be walking in her condition. Rhaenyra's father King Viserys then arrives to proudly view his new grandchild, saying he will make a fearsome knight. Viserys is in relatively good spirits, but his decline has not stopped in the past decade, only slowed: the infection that was eating away at his hand continued to spread, and after losing several fingers he has now had his left arm amputated up to the elbow.
When Alicent asks what they intend to name the baby, Laenor interjects ahead of Rhaenyra that he will be named "Joffrey" (clearly named after his lost lover Joffrey Lonmouth who was killed at their wedding). Viserys insists that he has his father's nose, resulting in awkward glances between the rest. Laenor says that Rhaenyra must rest, so she hugs her father goodbye while leaving Laenor to hold the baby. On the other side of the room, Alicent leans over Joffrey and softly says to Laenor, "Do keep trying: soon or late, you may get one who looks like you."
Rhaenyra and Laenor head back to their private chambers, and she expresses her annoyance that he named the baby without consulting her. He says they are both his parents and he should have some say in their family, to which the tired Rhaenyra says "only one of us is bleeding". Laenor looks back down the corridor to Alicent's chambers and realizes that Rhaenyra has been leaving a trail of blood all along the floor from the childbirth she finished a matter of minutes ago.
In their private chambers, Rhaenyra and Laenor are greeted by their two elder sons: Jacaerys Velaryon (Jace) and Lucerys Velaryon (Luke), along with Ser Harwin Strong, the Commander of the City Watch. None of Rhaenyra's three sons has traditional Valyrian silver-white hair: all of them have dark hair and light skin, and look nothing like Laenor. They do bear a strong resemblance, however, to Ser Harwin, who has deep affection for them. Jace and Luke reveal that they've already picked out a dragon egg to put in Joffrey's cradle, to help him bond with it, and Harwin ostensibly came to guard the egg as they transported it from the Dragonpit. Despite their odd parental relationship, Jace and Luke are amiable and reasonably well-behaved. Laenor insists that their mother must rest, and sends the two boys to continue their training at the Dragonpit.
At the Dragonpit
The Dragonkeepers instruct Rhaenyra's sons Jace and Luke, as well as Alicent's sons Aegon (now a lazy, bratty teenager) and her younger son Aemond Targaryen. The focus of their lesson this day is training Jace's young dragon Vermax, a juvenile the size of a small horse, to accept his verbal commands. Aegon is bored with the event because he already went through it for his own dragon Sunfyre, and for the dragons of the younger children. Jace successfully commands the dragon to obey and halt, and then to breathe fire at a live sheep. They leave Vermax to eat his roasted prey.
Aemond is upset because he is the only one of the children who hasn't bonded with a dragon yet. The other three boys insist that they have a surprise: Aegon says they felt bad that he doesn't have a mount, so they found a fresh new dragon for him. Aemond is suspicious, then Luke returns from the lower level with a pig. The sow has brooms tied to her as makeshift wings, and the boys mockingly present Aemond with "the Pink Dread". The other boys dissolve into laughter and leave.
Annoyed, Aemond descends into the lower levels of the dragonpit below the main area, into the caverns where the dragons nest. Hoping to find one of the unclaimed dragons, he presses on in the dark, until he is startled by Dreamfyre, who angrily breathes fire in his direction. Stumbling backward onto the floor, Aemond flees out of the dragonpit with only a face full of ash.
Alicent and the children
Back in her private chambers, Alicent sits with her daughter Helaena Targaryen: a baby at the time of her half-sister Rhaenyra's wedding, she is now an eleven year-old young lady. Helaena is somewhat introverted and intently focused on details about her insect collection. A Kingsguard then drags in Aemond, covered in ash and soot. Helaena observes that he's "done it again", and Alicent scolds him for how dangerous it is to keep trying to claim an adult dragon on his own. Humiliated, Aemond explains that the other boys gave him a pig dressed up as a dragon and they all laughed at him. Concerned and sympathetic, Alicent lovingly embraces her son and assures him that he will have a dragon some day. Helaena strangely says that he'll have to close an eye.
Alicent then discusses the incident with Viserys as he is continuing to work on his model of Valyria's capital city (which after a decade has expanded to cover much of the large room it is in). Viserys gently chides that it would be foolish for Aemond to think the other boys were capable of wrangling up some unclaimed young dragon for him on their own, and he suspects the originator of the prank might have been Aemond's own elder brother Aegon.
Alicent insists that it must have been Rhaenyra's boys, and says their savagery isn't surprising given their nature. Viserys dismisses his servant, and Alicent gets straight to the point: Rhaenyra's three sons look nothing like her husband Laenor and are quite probably Harwin Strong's bastard sons. Alicent is stunned by Rhaenyra's audacity, saying that to have one child like that is a mistake, but to have three sons like that is an insult. Rhaenyra kept having an affair with Harwin even after her first son shockingly resembled him, with no fear of being caught.
Viserys counters that the nature of inheritance can be a strange thing: he once had a stunning black mare that escaped her stable and mated with an equally stunning stallion silver as the moon, but their resulting foal was a plain chesnut brown. Alicent questions if Viserys actually saw them mating, or if he just assumed the silver stallion was the only one the black mare was breeding with. Viserys rises and says he will hear no more of this.
Alicent talks with Criston Cole as they return from the king's chambers, outraged that Viserys is willfully blind to the obvious. The entire royal court already thinks Rhaenyra's three sons are bastards, but none of them dare openly say it. Criston curses about Rhaenyra, whom he once loved, but apologizes when Alicent, clearly disapproving of his language and attitude, gives him a look. She says she has to believe that honor and decency will eventually prevail over Rhaenyra's continued offenses.
Alicent enters young Aegon's private chamber, to find him standing naked and masturbating in a castle window. Startled, he dives back into his bed and she pretends not to notice. She confronts him about the pig incident, and he awkwardly tries to shift blame to Rhaenyra's boys before admitting that it was just a funny prank and he doesn't see what was so bad about it. Alicent is actually more annoyed that he enjoyed a prank with Rhaenyra's sons against his own brother Aemond, when he should understand like she does that they are his mortal enemies. As Rhaenyra's eldest son, Jace is in line to one day inherit the Iron Throne itself. As her own father Otto Hightower once impressed on her, Alicent exhorts Aegon that Rhaenyra will cut off anyone who challenges her inheritance to the throne. He innocently says that he won't challenge Rhaenyra, at which Alicent grabs his face and shouts into it that he is the challenge, simply by living and breathing, his existence as a male heir is a challenge to Rhaenyra. She finishes by imploring him that as the king's firstborn son, the entire realm knows in their bones that one day he will be king.
In Pentos
Across the Narrow Sea, in the Free City of Pentos, Daemon Targaryen is now married to Laenor's sister Laena Velaryon, who he was last seen flirting with at Rhaenyra's wedding a decade ago. Laena claimed the great dragon Vhagar as her mount, the last of the original three dragons from the Targaryen Conquest. Laena on Vhagar and Daemon on Caraxes entertain Pentoshi aristocrats and magisters by racing along the coast. Daemon and Laena are being hosted by the Prince of Pentos, Reggio Haratis, and for the past decade have been living as honored guests in his mansion. In the past decade of their marriage Laena has produced two daughters for Daemon: Baela Targaryen and her younger sister Rhaena Targaryen, and is pregnant with a third child. Unlike Laenor's children, both girls have Valyrian silver hair, as well as the darker skin of their Velaryon parent.
Haratis holds lavish feasts for Daemon's family and showers them with wealth and treasures, because their presence in the city acts as a deterrent against their common enemy: the Triarchy to the south. He reveals that the Triarchy has launched a new campaign into the Stepstones, allying with Qoren Martell of Dorne to attack from the west as well. Haratis offers Daemon large permanent landholdings in Pentos if he will join them in a renewed offensive against the Triarchy: Laena is hesitant, but Daemon says he will consider it.
Later that night, after Daemon finishes giving Baela a lesson in High Valyrian, Laena urges him not to take the offer. They have been glorified guests for the past decade, but she wants the life of a dragonrider, and for her daughters to grow up where she did on Driftmark. Daemon says he knows their situation in Pentos is transactional - their dragons scare off the Triarchy and in return the Pentoshi shower them with wealth - but he finds this straightforward arrangement a relief, having grown weary of the political scheming in Westeros.
Laena then visits her younger daughter Rhaena, who is warming her dragon egg in a brazier. She laments that she is the only one of them without a dragon, as her older sister Baela's egg already produced a young hatchling. Rhaena's egg was put in her cradle as a baby to help her bond with it, but after eight years it still hasn't hatched. Laena consoles her daughter that half of the dragon eggs never hatch and she herself didn't claim a dragon until she was 15 years old, but then she bonded with mighty Vhagar, the largest living dragon.
Later in the night, Daemon looks out over the city's night skyline from the roof of the mansion. Laena arrives and tells him that her brother Laenor wrote a letter saying Rhaenyra had a third son. Daemon sarcastically asks if he mentioned that this child also has a marked but entirely coincidental resemblance to the commander of the City Watch. Laena says she can tell Daemon is disatisfied with his life in Pentos even if he won't admit it. Laena points out that Daemon never ventures into the city, but spends most of his time in the library reading about dead Valyrian dragonlords. She says she knows she wasn't his first choice as wife, which he tries to wave aside, but she gently embraces him and says the man she married was meant for more than this life in Pentos.
The training yard incident
In the Red Keep's training yard, Criston Cole instructs Aegon, Aemond, Jace, and Luke. Rhaenyra's children are dressed in red and black clothes, while Alicent's children are dressed in green clothes. King Viserys proudly watches from a higher level along with Lyonel Strong, and Harwin Strong has accompanied Rhaenyra's sons to the yard. Criston pits the much older Aegon against Jace, even though Harwin points out it isn't a fair match: Aegon nearly overpowers Jace but he makes a desperate counter-attack against the overconfident teenager. Criston then coaches Aegon as Harwin coaches Jace. In their second bout Aegon manages to knock Jace down and Criston shouts at him to keep attacking his defeated opponent, which he enthusiastically does after his mother's recent instruction that Rhaenyra's sons are his enemies. Harwin intervenes to pull him off Jace, criticizing Criston for teaching the boys cruelty against a weaker opponent. Criston goads Harwin by observing that he shows an unusual level of interest in Rhaenyra's boys, the kind a man normally only shows to his own sons. Enraged at the insinuation, Harwin knocks Criston on his back with a punch to the face, then continues to pummel him. Four other Kingsguard have to pull Harwin off Criston, as he dares him to say it again: Criston didn't even try to fight back, smiling as he spits out blood because he made Harwin embarrass himself in front of the king.
One of Rhaenyra's handmaids informs her of the "incident" in the yard, and she uses the hidden entrance to the secret passage system that Daemon showed her to listen in on a heated conversatin between Harwin and his father Lyonel. Harwin tries to defend himself that Criston was having Aegon beat up the heir to the Iron Throne, but Lyonel shouts at him that he has drawn suspicion on himself and their family. He tells his son that anyone in the castle who has eyes including himself have their suspicions, stopping short of saying aloud that the suspicion is that he is the real father of Rhaenyra's three sons. Everyone knows, Lyonel says, including King Viserys himself: but because Viserys himself is willfully blind to it, no one dares say it in public. This deeply upsets Rhaenyra, who had been in something of a bubble at the royal court and didn't consciously admit just how widespread the suspicions were about her sons.
Later, Rhaenyra's handmaid Elinda Massey gives her warm soaked towels to sooth the pain in her breasts, as noblewomen don't feed their own children but uses wet nurses. Laenor then arrives drunk and singing with his romantic companion Qarl Correy after a night of celebrating in Flea Bottom. Ordering the others to depart, Laenor tells Rhaenyra the good news that fighting has renewed in the Stepstones: he says that he is a dragonrider and a warrior and wants to feel alive again going into battle. Rhaenyra scolds him for being unaware of the mounting threats against them and increasing rumors after a third son was born who doesn't look like him. She says they both agreed that their marriage was a sham when they began it and she doesn't begrudge Laenor for continuing his affairs with other men, but she would like his support: if Laenor were to leave for the Stepstones it would make him look even less connected to Rhaenyra's sons. Laenor says that a wise sailor leaves ahead of a gathering storm rather than try to defeat it. Exhausted, she commands him as his Princess to stay in King's Landing.
The Small Council
Rhaenyra and Alicent attend a meeting of the Small Council with Viserys. In the past decade Mellos died of old age, and has been replaced as Grand Maester by the younger Orwyle, whose treatment of Viserys has been more effective than Mellos's leechings. Jasper Wylde has also been appointed as the new Master of Laws to fill the spot vacated by Lyonel Strong when he became Hand of the King. Lyman Beesbury is still Master of Coin, though he has grown somewhat slow in his old age. Rhaenyra and Alicent disagree on every issue: Rhaenyra has a more hands-on and interventionist approach to rule, while Alicent is more diplomatic and wants to delegate issues to regional rulers, worried about repercussions.
House Blackwood and House Bracken have had yet another border dispute in their ancient feud. Alicent wants to delegate the ruling to House Tully, but is told that Lord Grover Tully has grown bedridden in his old age. Alicent says they should just wait for Grover's son to deal with it, but Rhaenyra argues that the Blackwoods and Brackens will use any excuse to spill each other's blood. Instead, she points out that local countryfolk will know where the ancient border markers have been so they should send envoys to ask.
They then move on to the renewed conflict in the Stepstones with the Triarchy, now allied with independent Dorne. Viserys bitterly says that he'd hoped his ongoing negotiations with House Martell to keep them out of the region would succeed, but that shows what he gets for ever trusting a Martell. Jasper Wylde quips that Daemon was hailed as "King of the Narrow Sea" after winning a single battle, and Alicent points out he abandoned the islands ten years ago. Rhaenyra interjects that all of them abandoned the Stepstones, and angrily questions why the crown didn't fortify and garrison the isles to control the vital sea lanes going through them. Alicent responds that they couldn't afford it, as while they have enjoyed an era of prosperity their funds are not infinite. Beesbury agrees the cost was too great, but Rhaenyra declares that war would cost the common people even more.
With the new business finished for the day the council rises to leave, but Rhaenyra asks them all to stay as she has another issue to propose. Rhaenyra politely says that she is aware of the recent tension between her family and Alicent's but they are all part of the royal house, and were friends before that. As a peace offering, she proposes a betrothal between her eldest son and heir Jace and Alicent's daughter Helaena. Additionally, when her dragon Syrax produces a new clutch of eggs she will gift one to Aemond. Viserys says this is quite a judicious proposal, but Alicent is incredulous. She embarrasses Rhaenyra by indicating that she is leaking breat milk through her dress, and flatly says she will consider it.
After leaving the council, Alicent argues with Viserys that this offer is an insult, stopping short of saying aloud it is because Jace is really a bastard. Alicent thinks that Rhaenyra is only making this offer because she has been backed into a corner. Viserys tries to urge her that this will bring peace to the royal family and as king he should be able to make this choice, but Alicent sharply says that he can do what he wants when she's cold in her grave. They arrive at the king's private chambers where they are soon joined by Lyonel Strong, who has come to offer his resignation as Hand. He says that recent rumors have compromised his ability to give the king impartial aide and counsel. Viserys is hesitant to lose his trusted advisor, and asks him to say aloud what these rumors are, but, Lyonel cannot. Viserys says that if he can't bring himself to speak these rumors aloud he can't resign due to them. Lyonel agrees, but asks that he take Harwin back to Harrenhal: he has been dismissed as Commander of the City Watch, but as Lyonel's eldest son and heir it is time he prepares to rule their family's seat. Viserys agrees.
Alicent later meets for a meal in her private chambers with Lyonel's younger son, Larys Strong, who in the past few years has taken a position as a royal interrogator in the dungeons. Alicent has come to rely on him as an informant, though this time it is her turn to inform him of events at the Small Council: Larys's father refused to confront the king about Harwin's alleged affair with Rhaenyra, and so will remain as Hand. Alicent laments her lack of allies at court, and says if her father Otto Hightower was there she could rely on him to be impartial. Larys points out that her own father wouldn't exactly be "impartial", to which Alicent sharply says in frustration that he would be partial to her. Alicent openly wonders if in all of King's Landing there is no one to take her side.
Seizing on this as a pretext, Larys goes down to the castle dungeons and picks out three men condemned to death. He offers that if they become his agents he will spare their lives, though they will need to have their tongues cut out so they can't repeat his secrets.
Meanwhile, Harwin Strong makes an emotional but silent goodbye to Rhaenyra and her three sons. After he leaves, Rhaenyra tells Jace they can still write to him. Jayce, the eldest and most cognizant of her sons, then bluntly asks if Harwin Strong is really his father and if he is a bastard. Taken aback, Rhaenyra cannot bring herself to give him a straight answer aloud: instead she says that as her son he is a Targaryen, and that's all that matters. Both of them aware of what her indirect answer truly implies, Jace is left stunned.
Two deaths by fire
In Pentos, Laena has gone into labor but it takes a bad turn. The physician informs Daemon that the baby has breeched, presenting him with a similar choice to the one his brother Viserys faced when Queen Aemma Arryn died in childbirth. The physician isn't even sure if the child is alive, but says he could try to cut it out of her. While Viserys in this situation asked if the child could be saved, Daemon asks if there is any way to save the mother's life, and the physician says no. Overhearing them, Laena manages to flee the room and the mansion and rushes out to her dragon on the beach. Preferring a dragon-rider's death, and a quick one instead of continued agony, she commands Vhagar to burn her. After some hesitation, Vhagar complies and immolates her just in time for Daemon to see. At dawn, Daemon and his devastated daughters look out from the mansion's roof at Laena's charred remains below.
In the Riverlands, Lyonel escorts Harwin back to Harrenhal, the massive castle left half-ruined a century before during the Targaryen Conquest, and later gifted to House Strong. Larys's tongueless agents follow them. Lyonel is awakened in the night by a fire they set in the castle. Harwin rushes to the door of his father's chamber but the heat has sealed the lock shut. The ceiling collapses on them and both burn to death.
Meanwhile, Rhaenyra finds Laenor practicing in the yard with Qarl Correy. After her attempts at peace with Alicent have failed, she has agreed with his advice and wants to leave before gathering storm. She will relocated with her sons and household to her seat at Dragonstone island, where they will be free of wagging tongues and Alicent's plotting. She asks him to come with her, and invites him to bring his compaion Qarl as well: she now realizes they will need every sword they can for the eventual conflict with Alicent and her children.
Larys Strong then meets with Alicent in her private chambers and cheerfully reveals to her that he had his own father and brother burned to death, an act of Kinslaying that will elevate him as the new Lord of Harrenhal, and which will clear the post of Hand of the King for Alicent's father Otto to return. Alicent, however, is horrified at his crime, and says she never wished for this. Larys assures her that she will reward him when the time is right.

Behind the scenes
General
- The title of the episode derives from The Princess and the Queen, or, the Blacks and the Greens - a slightly abridged version of the first five Dying of the Dragons chapters in Fire & Blood, released as a stand-alone novella in an anthology in 2013. The title refers to Rhaenyra Targaryen and Alicent Hightower.
- This episode marks the first appearance of Essos in the TV series, with the scenes at Pentos. In the franchise overall, lands beyond Westeros itself were last seen in Game of Thrones: Season 6, and Pentos itself was last seen in Season 5. This is discounting the Stepstones, which are a border region not considered part of either continent, and which didn't appear in the original series.
- This episode also marks the first time that the Riverlands have appeared in the TV series proper - discounting the brief Prologue scene showing the Great Council of 101 AC, also at Harrenhal, which only showed the interior of the main hall.
- Alicent's cutting remark to Laenor about baby Joffrey, "Do keep trying, soon or late you'll get one that looks like you," is straight from the book.
- In Fire & Blood, it is actually somewhat ambiguous whether Rhaenyra's three sons are Laenor's or bastards fathered by Harwin Strong: it is very probable that they are Harwin's, but both Rhaenyra and Laenor have non-Valyrian grandparents. Rhaenyra's maternal grandfather was Rodrik Arryn, and Laenor's maternal grandmother was Jocelyn Baratheon: Rhaenys Targaryen had black hair in her youth, which simply went silver in old age. Even within the TV version, however, the only difference is that Rhaenyra herself fully believes that they are Harwin's, but this doesn't rule out the possibility that she could be wrong.
- This episode again brings up the Targaryen tradition of putting dragon eggs in their infants' cradles, as explained in the first two episodes of the season. This is done in the hope that it will help them bond more easily, and this episode shows that Jace and Luke picked out an egg for baby Joffrey.
- Alicent remarks that she's surprised Jace and Luke's eggs ever hatched, because she is convinced they are bastards: she and her supporters similarly alleged in the books that their eggs would never hatch. After they did hatch, Rhaenyra's supporters pointed to this as proof that they were not bastards. Both sides overlooked the obvious point that the boys' mother is a Targaryen, there's no doubt that they came out of Rhaenyra, so whether the eggs hatched or not isn't proof they're bastards one way or the other.
- Laena herself directly explains to Rhaena in this episode that many cradle-eggs simply never hatch, and several famous dragon-riders had to claim adult dragons who had previous riders. King Viserys and Daemon both claimed dragons with previous riders (Balerion and Caraxes), Laena herself claimed Vhagar, and even Alicent's own daughter bonded with the adult dragon Dreamfyre, so apparently none of their cradle-eggs hatched. Laena says here that "half" of the eggs never hatch (or don't hatch for decades): the books don't give a specific fraction but do indicate that many eggs do not hatch.
- Within the episode it's said that Aemond is the only one of Rhaenyra and Alicent's children who hasn't claimed a dragon yet, but doesn't directly name all of them. HBO's official viewer's guide website confirmed that they have the same names as in the books: Luke's dragon is Arrax (another juvenile like Jace's Vermax), while Helaena's dragon is Dreamfyre. Subtitles confirm that Dreamfyre actually does appear on-screen, as she is the dragon that scares off Aemond in the tunnels. It's mentioned in dialogue that Aegon already has a dragon as well, named Sunfyre. Laena and Rhaena also directly state that Baela has a young dragon of her own but don't mention its name, which the HBO website confirms is "Moondancer".
- Helaena Targaryen is presented as introverted, and possibly on the autistic spectrum. She isn't described like this in the books, though her daughter Jaehaera is. The TV series also invented the detail that she seems to have strongly inherited the Targaryen bloodline's tendency towards prophetic dreams and visions. Her enigmatic line about Aemond "He'll have to close an eye" is a foreshadowing of what is about to happen in the next episode.
- Laenor tells Rhaenyra that according to his lover Qarl, there is a new captain-general leading Triarchy forces in the Stepstones, a giant of a man who dyes his beard purple and wears women's frocks. While his name isn't mentioned, this description matches Racallio Ryndoon, an infamously flamboyant pirate and major recurring character in the book. He was indeed assigned by the Triarchy to lead the new counter-offensive into the Stepstones, though in the book this happened only two years after Daemon's victory over Craghas Crabfeeder at Bloodstone, not a full ten years later.
- In the previous episode, Daemon boldly announced that he intended to fly to the Eyrie to present to Lady Jeyne Arryn his claim over his late wife's lands at Runestone; there is no mention of what has become of that in this episode.
- According to Fire & Blood, Daemon (who was in the Stepstones when Rhea died), did fly to the Vale to lay claim to her property, but Jeyne Arryn rejected his claim. He then flew back to his ally Corlys Velaryon on Driftmark, and while there continued to court his daughter Laena. Knowing that Viserys wouldn't approve of him remarrying so soon, he took Laena on a tour of the Free Cities. When she became pregnant, they stopped and settled in Pentos.
- Harwin Strong pummeling Criston Cole on the ground in this episode visually parallels how Criston pummeled Joffrey Lonmouth in the previous episode.
- The Small Council scene mentions that the head of House Tully at this time is Lord Grover Tully. This is his name in the book, as George R.R. Martin humorously named all of the Tullys in this era after muppets from Sesame Street:
- Lord Grover is very old and in his final years mostly bedridden with a prolonged illness. As said in the Small Council scene, Riverrun at this time is ruled in all but name by his son (unnamed in the book).
- Lord Grover's grandson is Elmo, whose young son Kermit is said to be just a green boy, and his younger brother Oscar is still greener.
- Larys has the prisoners' tongues ripped out before becoming his agents, to keep them from revealing his secrets. Varys did this in the books to many of his "Little birds" for the same reason, as did Euron Greyjoy to his crew.
- Larys mentions the alleged curse of Harrenhal, which has been mentioned only once in Game of Thrones, and only briefly in the Histories & Lore segments "The Riverlands" and "Harrenhal". In the A Song of Ice and Fire novels, the curse is occasionally mentioned as the reason for the destruction of all the houses that ever possessed Harrenhal and the deaths of all the individuals who served as its castellans (the only exceptions so far are Roose Bolton, who briefly held it but never "ruled" it, and Petyr Baelish, who was named the nominal lord but never took up residence there). In truth, the houses that are granted Harrenhal might come to bad ends because it is somewhat of a toxic gift: it controls the most fertile area in the Riverlands, which means that it invites envy and different lords are constantly fighting over it as political favor. House Strong came to rule it early in the reign of King Jaehaerys, about fifty years before this episode, after House Towers died out.
- The insect on Larys Strong's cane is a firefly, according to the HBO viewer's guide website; his henchmen wear firefly-shaped brooches. This isn't a detail from the book, but apparently in the TV version he has chosen his own personal sigil different from his family's traditional heraldry. This parallels how Petyr Baelish's personal sigil was an inoffensive mockingbird, even though his family's sigil up until then had been the head of the Titan of Braavos.
- The fire at Harrenhal which kills Lyonel and Harwin Strong is one of the major "unreliable narrator" moments in Fire & Blood: four different possible culprits are suggested but without definitively saying who had them killed. None of them say the potential culprits personally did it themselves but they must have used agents:
- Septon Eustace, the anti-Rhaenyra source, says that Daemon did it to remove Harwin as a rival for Rhaenyra's romantic affections.
- Mushroom, the ribald dwarf court jester, says that Corlys did it to take revenge on the man who cuckolded his son Laenor.
- Grand Maester Mellos, normally a neutral source in his chronicles, expressed his suspicions that King Viserys himself was responsible, to try to crush the rumors that Harwin was the real father of Rhaenyra's sons.
- "Other sources" suggest rumors that Larys Strong did it, as the death of his father and older brother elevated him to be the new Lord of Harrenhal, and also removed Lyonel as Hand, paving the way for Otto Hightower to resume that position. Soon after Otto returned, Larys was then made the new Master of Whisperers. The TV series used this version.
- This is the third episode in a row in which rats have been seen scurrying around the Red Keep. The rats are able to sneak around through the network of secret passages, and are perhaps a metaphor for how Targaryen rule is starting to decay from within.
- The argument about the War for the Stepstones between Rhaenyra and Alicent resembles Corlys's request for help against the Triarchy and Otto's refusal ("The Rogue Prince"), in which it was unclear if Otto genuinely thought it was too expensive or if he was happy to see his rivals in House Velaryon have their shipping attacked. Similarly, it's unclear now if Alicent actually thinks it would have been too expensive to garrison the Stepstones or if she truly didn't want to help the Velaryons secure their conquest. After the Velaryons did capture the Stepstones, in "King of the Narrow Sea" Viserys and his Small Council were outright concerned that the Velaryons now had a stranglehold on trade going through the sea lanes on Westeros's east coast.
- Both scenes are similar to the argument between Cersei Lannister and the Tyrell siblings regarding the ironborn's raid of the Shield Islands (A Feast for Crows, Cersei VII). Cersei's inner monologue clearly reveals that she doesn't care that the ironborn are attacking the Tyrells because she considers them her political rivals.
- The colors of the clothes Rhaenyra's children (red and black) and Alicent's children (green) wear at the training yard - symbolize the rival factions at Viserys's court, the Greens (supporters of Alicent's children) and the Blacks (Rhaenyra's supporters).
Filming locations
Filming locations for this episode included:
- Castillo de La Calahorra in Granada was used for locations in Pentos.[1]
The ten year time jump
- This episode marks the largest time jump in the entire series, with almost a decade passing since the previous episode. Several main cast members have been replaced by adult versions, and eight different children of the main characters are introduced. Discounting baby Joffrey because he doesn't talk yet, while Aegon and Helaena previously appeared as infants/toddlers, this still introduces seven new roles with speaking lines:
- Emma D'Arcy replaces Milly Alcock as Rhaenyra Targaryen, who is now 28 or 29.
- Olivia Cooke replaces Emily Carey as Alicent Hightower, around the same age as Rhaenyra.
- John Macmillan replaces Theo Nate as Laenor Velaryon.
- Nanna Blondell replaces Savannah Steyn as Laena Velaryon, who is now 26.
- Ty Tennant portrays a 13-year-old Aegon Targaryen.
- Evie Allen portrays an 11-year-old Helaena Targaryen.
- Alicent has a third child, Aemond Targaryen.
- Rhaenyra and Laenor have three children: Jacaerys, Lucerys, and newborn Joffrey.
- Daemon Targaryen has married Laena Velaryon, with whom he has two daughters: Baela and Rhaena Targaryen.
- Other characters have aged significantly, or even died off-screen:
- Viserys I Targaryen looks much older than he actually is due to his deteriorating health. He has lost most of his hair as well as his left forearm.
- Lyonel Strong is now balding and grey.
- Lyman Beesbury is now bald.
- Grand Maester Mellos has passed away, and has been succeeded by Orwyle (his assistant in the preceding episode).
- Emma D'Arcy and Olivia Cooke are not technically "replacing" Milly Alcock and Emily Carey, because the adult versions of the characters were cast first, then after a months-long search Alcock and Carey were cast to match them as younger versions of their characters. Alcock and Carey explained that they were specifically instructed not to meet the older actors or to base their performances on them, because logically, people don't know what their future self will end up being like. In contrast, D'Arcy and Cooke did study the performances of their younger versions.
- The time skips in this story were a major point of contention between George R.R. Martin and the prior leadership of HBO, and why it almost didn't get made despite being the first potential prequel Martin himself suggested in July 2016. Among the first batch of five prequel pitches in 2017, Carly Wray was put in charge of the Dance of the Dragons pitch, but according to The Hollywood Reporter, her version (which HBO preferred at the time) would have started with the civil war itself. Martin, however, insisted that the story of the rivalry between Rhaenyra and Alicent and their respective children needed to be set up with the time skips in his book. By late 2017 Wray had left the project and it started over with Bryan Cogman, but his version was also rejected, until finally by late 2018 Ryan Condal made an entirely new pitch for a prequel series about the Dance of the Dragons, but in keeping with Martin's wishes his pitch began when young Rhaenyra was named the new royal heir after her mother's death in childbirth. House of the Dragon was finally ordered to series in late October 2019 (by the new AT&T-owned HBO): the hesitance to include the time skips set back the series order by over three years. As HBO's Casey Bloys explained it wasn't that HBO thought the time skips would be confusing, but that it would be (and was) extremely difficult to cast the lead roles not once but twice and to have each set of actors match.[2]
- Based on internal references, Rhaenyra and Laenor's wedding apparently occurred in the year 116 AC in the TV series (dates were moved around due to aging up several cast members). Episode 5 takes place soon after episode 4, stated to be four years since the series premiere episode. Therefore this episode takes place about 14 years since the premiere, roughly in the year 126 AC.
- Within this episode Rhaenyra and Alicent are both about 28 years old, as they are roughly the same age in the TV version. When this episode was filmed, Emma D'arcy was 29 years old and Olivia Cooke was 28 years old. Emily Carey was also similar to her character's age, as she was 17 while playing young Alicent as she progressed from 14 to 18 years old: in contrast, Milly Alcock was actually 21 years old when she filmed her role as young Rhaenyra across the same age range.
Altered and deleted scenes
- According to the unaltered High Valyrian dialogue for the episode shared by David J. Peterson, the scene with Jace and Vermax was originally going to be between Luke and Arrax.[3]
- In the Dragonpit scene, the Dragonkeeper Elder would have scolded Aemond for attempting to claim Dreamfyre, pointing out that once claimed, dragons will refuse to obey anyone but their rider. A fragment of this line survives in a different context earlier in the scene.[3]
- A deleted scene showing Daemon flirting with a male servant, revealing him as bisexual.[4]
- According to Peterson, the scene with Daemon, Laena, and the Pentoshi surgeon was originally supposed to be spoken entirely in High Valyrian. The final version is shortened and spoken entirely in the Common Tongue.[3]
- The ending would have featured a scene of Daemon hugging his daughters, but it was cut to show him simply walking away from them.[5]
