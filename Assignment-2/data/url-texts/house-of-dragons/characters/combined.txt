Biography
Background
Otto is the younger brother of Lord Hobert Hightower and the father of Gwayne and Alicent Hightower. He is the Hand of the King to Viserys I Targaryen and considers the king's brother and heir Prince Daemon Targaryen to be the greatest threat to the realm.[1]
Ser Otto was named Hand of the King by King Jaehaerys I Targaryen in 101 AC, following the death of Prince Baelon Targaryen.[2]
House of the Dragon: Season 1
Nine years into the reign of King Viserys, Otto attends a meeting of the Small Council. Lord Corlys Velaryon informs the council that the alliance in the Free Cities known as the "Triarchy" is trying to claim the Stepstones. The Sea Snake warns that Westerosi ports could be negatively affected, but his concerns are dismissed by Otto and the king. Otto swiftly turns the discussion to the more joyous topic of the upcoming Heir's Tournament which the king has planned for the approaching birth of his next child and hopeful son. Later that night, Otto is present when Grand Maester Mellos and Maester Mickon are attending to an infected wound on the king's back. Otto instructs Mellos to keep the affliction a secret.[3]
That same night, Prince Daemon leads the City Watch in hunting down the criminals of King's Landing, rounding them up en masse to face summary justice. At the Small Council meeting the following morning, Otto protests that the public measures were too excessive and that he cannot be allowed to act with such impunity. Otto demands that Daemon account for his actions; Daemon defends himself by stating that he followed the king's laws, and with most of Westeros's nobility coming to the king's tourney, it was a justified action to ensure their safety. Otto then says that Daemon should put as much effort into his marriage as his work with the gold cloaks, as Daemon hadn't been seen with his wife Rhea Royce at Runestone, or even in the Vale of Arryn, for a long time. Daemon insults his wife, and when Otto responds to defend her honor, Daemon states that he would be happy for his wife to share Otto's bed as his own wife has so recently passed. Otto furiously rises to his feet at the affront, but Viserys defuses the argument, bidding Otto not to rejoin his brother's provocation. Otto begrudgingly complies.[3]
The following day, Otto sits beside the king in the royal box as the Heir's Tournament commences. Otto whispers to Viserys that he could have Lord Boremund Baratheon's tongue cut out after he called Princess Rhaenys the "Queen Who Never Was," but the king dismisses it as harmless. Otto is further provoked by Daemon as he picks as his first opponent in the joust his eldest son Ser Gwayne Hightower, defeating Gwayne in the second tilt by tripping his horse. Daemon then asks for and receives Otto's daughter Alicent's favor. As the tournament continues, a maester arrives and informs Otto about Queen Aemma's difficult labor, with Otto then promptly telling Viserys and both leaving the tourney grounds. Otto then later returns to notify members of the Small Council of the news of the birth of Prince Baelon Targaryen and the death of the queen.[3]
Otto attends the funeral of Queen Aemma and Prince Baelon.[3]
At a Small Council meeting, Otto presses Viserys to set his succession firmly in order for the stability of the realm. With Baelon's death, Daemon is now once again Viserys's heir presumptive, but Otto, with the support of Grand Maester Mellos, is adamant that Daemon is too ambitious and insists that Daemon has the loyalty of the City Watch. Viserys responds that his brother may be ambitious but has no ambitions for the Iron Throne itself because kingship wouldn't suit him, and responds to Otto's complaints that Daemon's command of the City Watch effectively gives the prince a private army by pointing out that it was Otto's idea to give Daemon the command in the first place, as Otto had complained when Viserys named his brother Master of Laws that he was a tyrant, and then Master of Coin that he was a spendthrift. Otto concedes the point, but asserts that in his opinion Daemon should be kept far away from any power, as he could be a second Maegor the Cruel or worse. When Lord Lyonel Strong asks who else would have a claim, Otto suggests the king's firstborn child Rhaenyra. Viserys refuses the notion of choosing between his brother and his daughter, so Corlys offers an alternative: his own wife Rhaenys, which Otto dismisses as Corlys had already declared his support for Daemon. The discussion ends abruptly when Viserys berates his Small Council for behaving like crows squabbling over corpses while he is still mourning his wife and son.[3]
Later within the Tower of the Hand, Otto sends for his daughter Alicent and he gives a message to Grand Maester Mellos to be dispatched by raven to Oldtown. Otto embraces his daughter, comforting her and asking after Rhaenyra, then suggests that Alicent might offer her condolences to the grieving king in his chambers, telling her to wear one of her mother's dresses. Later that evening, at a pleasure house on the Street of Silk, Daemon hosts a party for his subordinates in the gold cloaks and several of his cronies. Otto reports these events to Viserys at a Small Council meeting the following morning, insisting that his sources claim Daemon dubbed Baelon the "Heir for a Day" and that it was a celebration.[3]
Otto and his daughter are in attendance at the ceremony naming Rhaenyra as Princess of Dragonstone and heir to the Iron Throne.[3]
Five months later, Otto attends a meeting of the Small Council. He has assisted the new Lord Commander of the Kingsguard Ser Harrold Westerling in choosing a number of candidates to come to court to fill the vacant seventh slot in the Kingsguard left by the death of Ser Ryam Redwyne. Lord Corlys storms into the council chamber announcing four Westerosi ships have been lost passing through the Stepstones, with Otto replying that the crown will compensate him and the families of the crews. When Corlys brings up that the pirates have no fear of Westeros because Daemon's occupation of Dragonstone with his army of gold cloaks hasn't been responded to by the crown, Otto warns him that he may have a seat at the council table but he is not the king's equal. Princess Rhaenyra interjects suggesting to use dragonriders to take the Stepstones, but with Otto's urging Viserys orders her to inspect and choose from the prospective replacements for Ser Ryam Redwyne instead.[4]
In Maegor's Holdfast, Otto arrives as Harrold presents the candidates to Rhaenyra. Otto instructs Rhaenyra on what to say to them, as she had so far not been interacting with any of them. Otto protests when Rhaenyra picks Ser Criston Cole for the vacancy, stating that a more politically valuable candidate should be chosen, which Rhaenyra rejects.[4]
Otto is in the chambers of Viserys with Grand Maester Mellos attending to an infected wound on the king's finger from the Iron Throne. Otto is informed by the king that Corlys and Princess Rhaenys have put forward a marriage proposal with their daughter, Lady Laena Velaryon, and is asked for his advise. Otto states that Corlys has overreached himself and the matter should be put to the council, as well as that Laena is young. Mellos acknowledges that the match would heal the wound made at the Great Council of 101 AC between House Targaryen and House Velaryon. Otto agrees with the Grand Maester's reasoning, and then brings up the pain of the passing of his own wife and that he does not envy Viserys being forced to remarry out of duty to the realm.[4]
Otto interrupts a private meeting between Viserys and Alicent to notify the king that he has summoned the Small Council. In the council chamber, one of the Dragonkeepers informs them that Prince Daemon has stolen a dragon egg, the same one Rhaenyra picked for Prince Baelon's cradle, from the Dragonpit. The king declares to Otto to assemble a detachment of guards and that he intends to remove Daemon from Dragonstone personally, but Otto insists that it is too dangerous for Viserys to go, volunteering to go in his place.[4]
Later in his chambers, Otto is putting on his armor with his daughter's help. He asks Alicent why, as the most comely girl at court, she hurts her own hands, then inquires if she will be visiting the king tonight. Ser Criston arrives to report that he has gathered twenty of the Hand's guard and Ser Harrold will be joining them.[4]
At Dragonstone, Otto leads the detachment along the bridge leading to the castle before they are intercepted by Daemon and his gold cloaks. Otto proclaims to Daemon that he is to relinquish control of the island and return the stolen dragon egg, disband his private army, and banish Mysaria from his side. Prince Daemon asks where the king is, to which Otto replies that Viserys would not lower himself to entertain such a "mummer's farce," telling Daemon that he is pathetic and desperate for his older brother's attention. Daemon insists he is merely following Targaryen traditions by placing an egg in the cradle of his unborn child with Mysaria. Otto retorts back that these traditions are for trueborn royalty rather than bastards. He proclaims Daemon's union with Mysaria an abomination and that he is soiling his own brother's reign. Otto calls out to the men of the City Watch who are present, asking if they wish to continue following the prince in his treason. Daemon responds they are loyal to him and challenges Otto to take the egg out of his hand, with Otto proclaiming that to do violence against the King's Hand would be to declare war on Viserys himself. When he states that a confrontation could kill Daemon's unborn child and its mother, Daemon draws Dark Sister, prompting the rest of both sides to draw their weapons too, though Otto orders his men to sheathe their swords when Caraxes appears. Before it can spiral into open conflict, Rhaenyra arrives on Syrax. Otto inquires why the princess is here and orders Criston to escort her to safety, to which Rhaenyra responds that she is here to stop bloodshed and ignores Otto's objection.[4]
The next day Otto and his daughter are summoned to a meeting of the Small Council, in which King Viserys announces his intention to marry Alicent Hightower before spring's end. Lord Corlys is outraged that his own daughter has been rejected, and marches out of the council chamber after Otto gives him a satisfied look.[4]
A year after his daughter's marriage to Viserys, she gives birth to a son, Aegon Targaryen. On Prince Aegon's second nameday, Otto joins a royal hunt arranged by Viserys. Otto is pressured by his brother, Lord Hobert Hightower, to convince Viserys to name Aegon his heir over Rhaenyra, as this would place a member of their dynasty on the Iron Throne. Otto expresses doubts that Viserys will be so easily convinced. When Ser Tyland Lannister counsels Viserys to send aid to the Stepstones, Otto steps in, reminding him that Daemon and Lord Corlys started the war without the crown’s leave, and that it would make the crown look weak to intervene now, after so long.[5]
When the hunting party arrives at the Kingswood, Otto joins the gathered lords and ladies in applauding the king, queen, and prince as they emerge from their carriage.[5]
Otto interrupts an argument between Viserys and Rhaenyra to inform the king that a white hart has been sighted. As the white hart is considered a symbol of royalty, Otto tries to convince Viserys that its appearance on Prince Aegon's nameday is a sign from the gods that Aegon should rule.[5]
That night, Otto informs Viserys that the Royal Huntsman has the trail of the white hart, and has sent out the hounds. When Viserys expresses his displeasure over Lord Jason Lannister's attitude in asking for Rhaenyra's hand, Otto reminds him that Rhaenyra will do as he commands, to which Viserys replies that he has no desire to command his own daughter. Otto makes another suggestion: Rhaenyra could marry her half-brother, Prince Aegon. Viserys laughs this off, however, as Aegon is only two years old.[5]
A stag is captured, but to Otto's disappointment, it is not a white one. Otto and the rest of the party watch as Viserys struggles to put down the captured animal. When he finally does so, all applaud him.[5]
Later, Otto and the rest of the party watch in some surprise as Rhaenyra returns to the camp with a boar she and Ser Criston Cole killed.[5]
After returning to King’s Landing from the hunt, Otto visits his daughter, pointing out to her how Aegon's birth has united the men, and ended fifteen years of uncertainty and doubt. He tells Alicent that she must convince Viserys to name Aegon his heir, as the realm would descend into chaos were Rhaenyra to be named instead of him, no matter how good a queen she may prove to be. Alicent is unhappy with the idea of raising Aegon to steal his sister's birthright.[5]
When Prince Daemon returns to King's Landing, victorious after the War for the Stepstones, Otto watches suspiciously as he kneels before Viserys and gives up his crown and the Stepstones to him. Viserys embraces his brother and holds a feast in Daemon's honor, which Otto attends.[2]
The Small Council meet to discuss Corlys Velaryon, and Otto informs the king that, according to his brother in Oldtown, Lord Corlys plans to marry his daughter Laena to the son of the Sealord of Braavos. This potential alliance would necessitate the crown making a marriage pact of their own.[2]
One night, Otto is informed by a spy working for the White Worm that Princess Rhaenyra and Prince Daemon were seen together in a pleasure house. Otto decides to inform the king, though with great reluctance. Although doing so would undoubtedly discredit both Daemon and Rhaenyra and give his grandson Aegon a clearer path to the throne, it gives him no pleasure to inform his king and friend of his daughter losing her virginity. When Otto informs Viserys, the king furiously accuses Otto of having his daughter stalked, and trying to destroy her reputation. Otto tries to deny this, but Viserys orders him out.[2]
Otto is later summoned to the Small Council chamber by Viserys. The king reminds him of how his father Prince Baelon Targaryen died only five days after King Jaehaerys named him Hand of the King, after which Otto took his place. Viserys has figured out that Otto set Alicent up to be his wife after Aemma passed, but Otto insists that Alicent loves him, as he knows Viserys loves her. Viserys thanks Otto for his service to the realm, but states that his judgement is compromised, and dismisses him as the King's Hand.[2]
As Otto prepares to leave King’s Landing, he is approached by Alicent, who tells him that she doesn’t want him to leave, but that she believes Rhaenyra’s claims of innocence. He tells her off for facilitating his dismissal as Hand, to which she responds that Otto himself is to blame due to how hard he pushed for Aegon to be heir. Otto chides her on her naivety and presents her with the cold logic of the situation: When Viserys inevitably dies, Rhaenyra will have to kill Alicent's children whether she wants to or not, simply to ensure her own survival in the ensuing conflict. Alicent therefore has only two choices: either start plotting to secure her position at court against Rhaenyra, or fully commit to ingratiating herself with her stepdaughter and hope that when Rhaenyra takes the throne, this will make her merciful enough towards Alicent that she won't kill her half-siblings. Unable to express in words that he loves her and wants to protect her, Otto gives his sobbing daughter a desperate final embrace and then rides out of the castle.[6]
Ten years later, after the deaths of Lyonel and Harwin Strong,[7] Otto is reinstated as Hand of the King.[8]

- — Otto and Alicent Hightower[src]
- Otto: "A loyal Hand must tell his king a discomforting truth from time to time, Your Grace. If he doesn't, he's failed as a servant."

- "You served my grandsire nobly in his final days. You are the man that taught me how to be king. Just five days... you went from being another man in Jaehaerys's court, to the second most powerful man in the realm. I wonder... how long did it take you to choose yourself over your king?"

Behind the scenes
On February 11, 2021, HBO announced that Rhys Ifans had signed on for House of the Dragon in the role of Otto Hightower. The character breakdown reads as follows:
- "The Hand of the King, Ser Otto loyally and faithfully serves both his king and his realm. As the Hand sees it, the greatest threat to the realm is the king's brother, Daemon, and his position as heir to the throne."
- ―HBO
In the books
In Fire & Blood, Ser Otto was famous for his knowledge. For this ability, he was named Hand of the King. He served as Hand of the King under Jaehaerys I, and Viserys I, but was not Hand continuously. While his intellect made him arrogant, he was also cautious and methodical.
Otto wasn't the head of House Hightower, but the younger brother of the unnamed head of the family. Otto's wife is never mentioned in the books, and her absence from several major scenes at court seems to imply that she has been dead for some time. Otto had multiple children, but the only ones identified were Alicent and her "youngest brother" Gwayne. All indications from Fire & Blood are that Otto actually had a good relationship with his family, that he loved and was loved by his children.
Otto first served as Hand after the death of Jaehaerys's Hand and son, Prince Baelon Targaryen. Jaehaerys was devastated by the death of his son and loss of his beloved wife Alysanne a year earlier. After resolving the succession crisis caused by Baelon's death with the Great Council of 101 AC, Jaehaerys's health rapidly failed and he spent the next two years largely bedridden. Otto effectively ruled the kingdom as Hand in the final two years of Jaehaerys's reign while his daughter Alicent Hightower nursed the ailing king.
In 109 AC, Viserys dismissed Otto from his office, because Otto kept bothering him about the inheritance issue (not for spying on Rhaenyra, which he did not). Lord Lyonel Strong replaced Otto as the King's Hand.
In 120 AC, following the deaths of Lyonel and Harwin at Harrenhal, Viserys reinstated Otto as his Hand.

Lord Corlys Velaryon,[N 1] known as the Sea Snake, is the head of House Velaryon and the husband of Princess Rhaenys Targaryen.
Biography
Background
Corlys is the Lord of the Tides, Master of Driftmark, and the head of House Velaryon. He is married to Rhaenys Targaryen, the cousin of Viserys I Targaryen.[1] He has two children with Rhaenys, named Laena and Laenor.
Corlys is the head of the Royal Fleet and sits on the Small Council as lord admiral and Master of Ships.[2] His moniker is derived from the Sea Snake, the most famous ship of the Velaryon fleet.[3]
House of the Dragon: Season 1
At a meeting of the Small Council, Corlys urges action against the Triarchy, an alliance formed by the Free Cities, which, according to his assessment, would gravely affect Westerosi ports, but his concerns are dismissed by Viserys Targaryen, and his Hand, Ser Otto Hightower.[4]
Corlys is present at the Heir's Tournament with his wife Rhaenys, and their two children Laena and Laenor.[4]
Corlys attends the funeral of Queen Aemma and Prince Baelon.[4]
The day after the funeral, in the Small Council chamber, the matter of the succession to the Iron Throne is brought up by Otto Hightower, where Corlys supports Daemon Targaryen's claim to the Iron Throne, due to male-preference primogeniture. When Otto suggests Rhaenyra instead, Corlys offers an alternative: his wife, Rhaenys, stating that she has a valid claim to the throne, and a male heir. Before the matter can be discussed further, Viserys furiously berates the Small Council for their squabbling while he is still in mourning, and abruptly ends the meeting.[4]
Corlys is amongst several lords of Westeros who were summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to both Viserys, and his named heir, Rhaenyra Targaryen, who is named the Princess of Dragonstone.[4]
Roughly six months after Aemma Arryn's funeral, Corlys reiterates the problems with the Triarchy, who have now sunk four Westerosi ships including one from the Velaryon fleet, gaining more power in the Stepstones, and demands to take action against the Triarchy to clear out the Stepstones. Viserys explains that, as an alternative, he has sent envoys to Pentos and Volantis, with the prospect of an alliance against the Triarchy, but Corlys warns that further inaction will only strengthen the belief that Viserys (and by extension, Westeros) is weak, which began with Daemon's illegal occupation of Dragonstone not being answered.[5]
Corlys and Rhaenys later try to forge a marriage alliance between House Targaryen and House Velaryon, by suggesting Viserys should marry their daughter, Laena Velaryon, uniting the Targaryen dragons and the Velaryon fleet, to prove the strength of his reign. Though several members of the Small Council support the idea of Viserys and Laena's union (due to its several political advantages), Viserys opts to marry Lady Alicent Hightower. Corlys, infuriated by yet another slight to his family by the Targaryens, leaves King's Landing and resigns from his position as Master of Ships. He returns to Driftmark, and propositions Daemon Targaryen to join him and his family in a war against the Stepstones, to claim glory for themselves.[5]
Three years later, Corlys and Daemon appear to be losing their war in a long and hard siege of Bloodstone, with several members of the army contemplating defecting. However, after Viserys offers to aid Daemon in his efforts with the Velaryons in the Stepstones, a counterattack is devised by Corlys's forces, led by Corlys and Daemon, and supported on dragonback by Seasmoke, ridden by Corlys's son, Ser Laenor. The Velaryon forces prevail after Daemon slays Craghas Drahar, preventing the ruin of House Velaryon.[6] Corlys and his army crown Daemon King of the Narrow Sea and return to Driftmark.[7]
Back at Driftmark, Corlys arranges a betrothal between Laena and the son of the Sealord of Braavos. The Small Council is worried about an alliance between the Velaryons and Braavos, but the issue is solved by another betrothal between Laenor Velaryon and Rhaenyra Targaryen.[7]
Some time later, Viserys and Rhaenyra sail to Driftmark to discuss the prospective marriage alliance between Rhaenyra and Laenor, where Corlys and Rhaenys inquire about the matter of the succession to the Iron Throne. After Viserys affirms that Rhaenyra and Laenor's firstborn will inherit the Iron Throne from her, regardless of gender, Corlys asks whether their children shall take the "Velaryon" name, to which Viserys replies that they will, but upon the heir's ascension to the Iron Throne, the king or queen will take the name "Targaryen," so the dynasty of dragons may continue. Corlys and Rhaenys then accept the union.[8]
Corlys and his family head to King's Landing for Laenor and Rhaenyra's wedding, where Viserys makes an impassioned speech about the union of the two remaining powerful Valyrian houses becoming one. Though the festivities start out well, the feast is interrupted by Ser Criston Cole's murder of one of House Velaryon's sworn swords, Ser Joffrey Lonmouth. Following the attack, Laenor and Rhaenyra are wed in a private, grim ceremony, of which their immediate family and their aides are in attendance.[8]
Roughly ten years later, Corlys and the Velaryon family learn that Corlys's daughter Laena has died in Pentos. Her remains are returned to High Tide, and a funeral is held there, with the extended Targaryen-Velaryon family all present. After Laena's burial, Corlys speaks to his grandson, Lucerys Velaryon, about his succession to Driftmark as Lord of the Tides, only to be surprised to learn that he does not wish to be the Lord of Driftmark if it means Corlys, and his father, Ser Laenor are dead. Corlys later witnesses a catatonic Laenor weeping in the water where Laena is buried, and angrily tells Ser Qarl Correy to retrieve him.[9]
Later in the night, Corlys and Rhaenys have a discussion surrounding Laena's death, in which Rhaenys places blame her death on both Daemon and the surgeons in Pentos, but Corlys tells her that she cannot place blame for an act of the gods. Rhaenys then contemplates whether this is punishment for their (namely Corlys's) relentless ambition for power. Though Corlys attempts to argue in favor of Rhaenys, she affirms that she no longer has any ambition for the Iron Throne, and that it is his ambition for power that is destroying his family piece by piece. Rhaenys then propositions Corlys to name Baela Targaryen, their eldest granddaughter by Laena, the heir to Driftmark, on the grounds that Baela is of true Velaryon blood, whereas Lucerys—Corlys's chosen heir—is not. Corlys, however, refuses on the grounds that this would only be admitting that Laenor's children are bastards, and disinheriting his line. Corlys is unconcerned with the truth of it, stating that history does not remember blood; it remembers names.[9]
Corlys and Rhaenys later enter the Hall of Nine at night, and demand answers following a fight between their grandchildren and Aemond Targaryen, which resulted in Lucerys slashing out Aemond's left eye. The next night, Laenor is apparently murdered in a duel with Ser Qarl in the Hall of Nine, and they grieve their son after finding his charred corpse (in actuality, Laenor is still alive and in exile in Essos, following a plot to fake his death orchestrated by Rhaenyra Targaryen, Daemon Targaryen, and Laenor himself).[9] Overcome with anger and grief from having lost both of his children due to his relentless ambitions, Corlys leaves Driftmark, and returns to the fighting in the Stepstones after the Triarchy becomes resurgent.[10]
After six years of fighting in the Stepstones, Corlys is severely injured in an ambush, reportedly having his throat slashed by a corsair and falling into the sea. Due to uncertainty surrounding his longevity, there is a dispute over the question of who should succeed him: his brother Vaemond, or Lucerys, his intended and chosen heir. Lucerys is confirmed as heir by King Viserys. Rhaenys, at Rhaenyra's proposal, betroths her and Corlys's grandchildren Lucerys and Rhaena Targaryen as well as Jacaerys Velaryon and Baela Targaryen with Viserys's blessing. Soon after, Corlys's brother, Vaemond, is executed by Daemon Targaryen for insulting his wife, Rhaenyra, and her family.[10]
Alicent attempts to gain Rhaenys's support for the Greens and Prince Aegon Targaryen to claim to the Iron Throne by claiming that even Corlys abandoned her, gone for six years to fight a desperate battle and returned badly injured, leaving Rhaenys to chart her course alone. The attempt is futile, as Rhaenys respects Corlys's wishes and affirms her allegiance to Princess Rhaenyra and the Blacks.[11]
Personality
Corlys is a shrewd man. Despite his several disagreements with King Viserys, he remains loyal to the crown.[12] Although he highly values his legacy,[9] he places blood over power.[12]

Behind the scenes
Corlys Velaryon was revealed to be a lead character in House of the Dragon on December 11, 2020. On February 11, 2021, HBO announced that Steve Toussaint had signed on for the series. The character breakdown reads as follows:
- "The lord of House Velaryon, a Valyrian bloodline as old as House Targaryen. As "The Sea Snake," the most famed nautical adventurer in the history of Westeros, Lord Corlys built his house into a powerful seat that is even richer than the Lannisters and that claims the largest navy in the world."
- ―HBO
In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, showrunner Ryan Condal addressed the decision to reimagine House Velaryon as black, revealing that it had in fact been George R.R. Martin's idea, and had been how the characters were originally envisioned in earlier drafts of A Song of Ice and Fire.[13]
In the books
In Fire & Blood, Corlys was the son of Corwyn Velaryon. He was named after Ser Corlys Velaryon, the first Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. Corlys once sailed his Ice Wolf beyond the Wall but was unsuccessful in finding a northerly route around Westeros. He then sailed aboard his Sea Snake on multiple voyages to Essos, accumulating wealth from visits to Qarth, Yi Ti, and Leng. Corlys was the first Westerosi to visit Nefer in N'Ghai and to navigate the Thousand Islands. During his last travel, Corlys filled the Sea Snake's hold with gold and bought twenty more ships at Qarth, loading them with spices, elephants, and silk. Corlys took his sobriquet from his famous ship, the expeditions of which are described in Maester Mathis's The Nine Voyages.
Corlys became head of House Velaryon after the death of his grandsire, Daemon. Richer than Lords Lannister or Hightower through his expeditions, Corlys used his great wealth to construct a new seat, High Tide, where he stored his eastern treasures.
Corlys vacated his seat on the Small Council following Viserys's coronation; a response to the perceived insult of Rhaenys being passed over for the throne. House Velaryon as a whole remains isolated from the royal court, preferring the solitude of Driftmark. The TV series has altered this somewhat, depicting the Velaryons as being a prominent fixture at court, while retaining Corlys's outspoken bitterness at the realm's rejection of his wife. He eventually left the royal court after Viserys chose to marry Alicent Hightower instead of Laena Velaryon.

- ―Rhaenyra Targaryen to Rhaenys Targaryen
Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen[N 2] is the daughter and only surviving child of King Viserys I Targaryen and his first wife, Queen Aemma Arryn. She disputes the claim of her younger half-brother Aegon II, using the style Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Lady of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm. A dragonrider, her mount is the she-dragon Syrax.
Biography
Background
Rhaenyra is the daughter and only surviving child of King Viserys I and Aemma Arryn.[4] She rides the dragon Syrax.[5]
House of the Dragon: Season 1
Rhaenyra returns to King's Landing after riding Syrax and visits her mother Aemma, who is heavily pregnant. While Rhaenyra is not very enthused at the prospect of having her own children, her mother reminds her of her duty as a princess, and that the childbed is a royal woman's battlefield. Rhaenyra later greets her uncle Daemon in the throne room, where he presents her with a gift acquired on his recent journey; a necklace made of Valyrian steel.[5]
Later that evening, Rhaenyra, and her friend, Lady Alicent Hightower spend time in the godswood, where Rhaenyra hopes that her unborn sibling is a boy, for the sake of her father, Viserys I's happiness, ignoring Alicent's remarks that a son would overshadow her in the line of succession.[5]
Rhaenyra is present in the royal box when her father commences the Heir's Tournament, where he announces that Aemma has gone into labor. Rhaenyra and Alicent are intrigued by a new contender in the tournament, Ser Criston Cole, after his victories against Lord Boremund Baratheon, and another Baratheon. Rhaenyra witnesses the duel between Ser Criston, and her uncle, Prince Daemon, in which Criston emerges victorious. He then asks Rhaenyra for her favor. She then tosses down a floral wreath to him, and bids Criston good luck in the rest of the tournament. In the middle of the tournament, the spectators in the royal box are informed of Queen Aemma's death in childbirth.[5]
Several days later, the royal court gathers outside the city walls of King's Landing for the funeral of Rhaenyra's mother, Aemma, and her infant brother, Prince Baelon. Rhaenyra bitterly ponders to her uncle, Daemon, whether her father finally found happiness in the few hours that Baelon lived, and laments that she will never make her father truly happy, as she is not a son. She then sets her mother and brother's funeral pyre ablaze, with a command of "Dracarys" to Syrax.[5]
After Viserys disinherits Daemon, he summons Rhaenyra to Balerion's shrine, to her confusion due to Viserys's recent lack of contact with her. Viserys then voices his intention to name Rhaenyra as his heir, and informs her of Aegon the Conqueror's vision, which he dubbed "The Song of Ice and Fire," which every legitimate heir to the Iron Throne has been informed of to ensure Westeros's readiness for the evil that Aegon foresaw. Some time later, the realm's nobility swears fealty to Viserys and Rhaenyra, and Rhaenyra is officially named Princess of Dragonstone.[5]
Six months after her mother's funeral, Rhaenyra speaks up at a Small Council meeting to voice her opinion on how to handle the situation in the Stepstones, suggesting dragonriders be sent to force the Triarchy's surrender. Instead of taking her advice, Viserys tasks her with filling the vacant spot on the Kingsguard, after Ser Ryam Redwyne's death. Ignoring advice from Otto Hightower that she choose a knight that would earn them a strong alliance, she selects Ser Criston Cole, due to him being the only knight being considered to have seen actual combat, rather than tourney fighting.[6]
Later that day, Rhaenyra visits a sept with Alicent, where she vents her frustration about the Small Council plotting to replace her as heir. The two pray to the Mother, with Alicent teaching Rhaenyra— who does not worship the Seven—how to do so. Rhaenyra tearfully expresses her wish that Viserys see her as more than his little girl.[6]
That night, Rhaenyra and Viserys share an awkward dinner, during which they discuss the appointment of Ser Criston Cole on the Kingsguard and briefly bond over their shared love of Aemma. When she tries to apologize for speaking out at the Small Council earlier, he dismisses it, stating that she is young, and will learn propriety in time.[6]
Rhaenyra and her cousin, the Princess Rhaenys Targaryen, discuss Rhaenyra's succession to the Iron Throne, and the possibility of her displacement as heir to the Iron Throne due to her sex, with Rhaenys bluntly telling Rhaenyra that the men of Westeros would sooner put the realm to the torch than allow a woman to ascend the Iron Throne.[6]
At the Small Council, Viserys and Rhaenyra get word from a Dragonkeeper Elder that Daemon has stolen a dragon egg from the Dragonpit, namely the one Rhaenyra had picked out for her brother, Baelon. Despite not being given leave to go to Dragonstone, Rhaenyra flies there atop Syrax to persuade Daemon to relinquish the dragon egg, and to leave the castle. She succeeds in getting the dragon egg back without bloodshed, but fails to get Daemon to leave Dragonstone. When Rhaenyra returns to King's Landing, Viserys angrily chides her for leaving and endangering herself, though he does credit her being the only person able to retrieve the egg without bloodshed. Viserys insists that because Rhaenyra is his only heir, the Targaryen line is vulnerable, and though he insists that he will not unname Rhaenyra as his heir, even if his new wife were to give him sons, he must ensure the continuation of the Targaryen line.[6]
At a Small Council meeting the next morning, Viserys announces his intention to marry Lady Alicent Hightower, which infuriates and disgusts Rhaenyra, hurt by her father and friend keeping this from her.[6]
Three years later, Rhaenyra's relationships with both her father and Alicent, now queen of the Seven Kingdoms, have soured, and is now disinclined to listen to either of them. She attends a royal hunt with her family to celebrate the second nameday of her half-brother, Prince Aegon Targaryen. At the camp, she is proposed to by Lord Jason Lannister, to which she declines. She then gets into a terse confrontation with her father, realizing that he intends to marry her off to one of the noblemen of Westeros, causing her to run off into the Kingswood. Ser Criston Cole goes after her, and she contemplates whether the realm will actually accept her as queen.[1]
After agreeing to get married to perpetuate the Targaryen line, she goes on a tour of Westeros to pick a lord of her choosing to wed. However, she cuts the progress short at Storm's End. Rhaenyra reunites with her uncle, Daemon, after four years, and he takes her through the Street of Silk late in the night, where she witnesses the true nature of King's Landing, and the smallfolk's opinion of her and her position in society. Rhaenyra and Daemon then go to a brothel, where Rhaenyra witnesses the pleasures of sex. She and Daemon then proceed to couple together, but Daemon is rendered impotent and leaves her in the brothel. Rhaenyra, still sexually aroused, seduces Ser Criston Cole, and loses her virginity to him.[7]
Rhaenyra and Daemon are seen together by a Lyseni boy, who brings word of this to Mysaria. Mysaria then orders the boy to inform Otto Hightower, who in turn brings the news to Rhaenyra's father Viserys. Alicent, who overheard the conversation between Viserys and Otto, confronts Rhaenyra about this, but she vehemently denies the allegations against her and Daemon. Viserys then confronts Rhaenyra about this, and to avoid scandal, he orders Rhaenyra to wed Ser Laenor Velaryon. She reluctantly agrees, on the condition that Viserys dismisses Otto as his Hand. That night, Grand Maester Mellos, at Viserys's behest, gives Rhaenyra moon tea as a precaution.[7]
Rhaenyra travels with her father to Driftmark to discuss a marriage alliance between her and Laenor. The two walk on a nearby beach, where Rhaenyra expresses that she is aware that the two of them love other people, and that he is no more enthusiastic about this marriage pact than she is. She proposes a mutual arrangement: they will perform their duty for their respective families to marry and produce heirs, but otherwise they will both continue having their own private romantic relationships. Later, as Viserys's ship heads back to King's Landing, Rhaenyra is approached by Criston on the deck. He tells her he knows she doesn't love Laenor and for years she's talked about her fear of being trapped in a loveless arranged marriage. Instead, he pleads with her to flee with him into exile beyond Westeros, where they can be married. Rhaenyra insists that she has duties to her family and to the realm that keep her from eloping with him. However, she doesn't consider this a problem because she just worked out an "understanding" with Laenor. Criston becomes agitated about being just Rhaenyra's "whore", hoping that he could restore some of his lost honor by marrying her. Rhaenyra begins to explain again that this is impossible, but Criston storms off.[8]
Game of Thrones: Season 3
Joffrey refers to Rhaenyra while giving Margaery a tour in the Great Sept of Baelor.[9]
Personality
Rhaenyra is strong-willed and independent.[10] Rhaenyra rejects the idea of being a lady and is more interested in flying on top of her dragon Syrax having adventures and choosing her own destiny.[5] During her youth, Rhaenyra was in love with her friend Alicent, and a long series of small rejections by Alicent culminating in her marriage to Viserys made Rhaenyra increasingly insecure, fueling the division and jealousy between them.[11][disputed; see talk page]
Family tree
1 Jaehaerys had thirteen children in all. For simplicity, only the direct ancestors of future generations are on this family tree and they are not in the exact order of birth. The thirteen children in correct order are: Aegon, Daenerys, Aemon, Baelon, Alyssa, Maegelle, Vaegon, Daella, Saera, Viserra, Gaemon, Valerion, and Gael.
2 While Jacaerys, Lucerys, and Joffrey are officially Laenor's, he and Rhaenyra never had any biological issue. His three sons are in fact fathered by Harwin Strong.

Behind the scenes
Rhaenyra Targaryen was revealed to be a lead character in House of the Dragon on July 18, 2020. On December 11, 2020, HBO announced that Emma D'Arcy had signed on for the series. The character breakdown reads as follows:
- "The king's first-born child. She is of pure Valyrian blood, and she is a dragonrider. Many would say that Rhaenyra was born with everything… but she was not born a man."
- ―HBO
On July 6, 2021, it was reported that Milly Alcock was set to portray young Rhaenyra.
In the books
In Fire & Blood, Rhaenyra was the daughter of King Viserys I, and his only child to survive the cradle by his wife, Aemma of House Arryn. Viserys's younger brother Daemon was his closest male heir, but many at court felt he was so unruly that he was unfit to sit the throne, so Viserys officially named Rhaenyra his heir. This decision was controversial, as it contradicted the principle of male-preference proximity which had put Viserys himself on the throne, instead of his older first cousin Rhaenys Targaryen (who according to primogeniture should have been the heir).
Rhaenyra was therefore raised expecting to one day sit the Iron Throne herself, becoming somewhat pampered and arrogant, though also receiving an education in government as befitting the heir to the throne. From an early age, Rhaenyra regularly sat at the foot of the Iron Throne while her father held royal court, and her father also regularly brought her to meetings of the Small Council. A precocious young girl, in her childhood she was known as "the Realm's Delight". The year before her mother died, Rhaenyra also become a dragonrider, claiming Syrax as her mount. One of Rhaenyra's personal tics was also that she tended to nervously play with her hands (or the rings on them) when she was thinking.

- ↑ Viserys states that Rhaenyra is 15 years old in "The Rogue Prince," which takes place in 112 AC. "The Heirs of the Dragon" takes place earlier in 112 AC, and in that episode she is 14 according to Emily Carey. (interview with Insider, Popsugar, and Metacritic). She was therefore born in 97 AC, same as in the books. Alicent Hightower is the same age as Rhaenyra according to the interview previously linked.

Mysaria is a brothel proprietor, information broker, and former prostitute and slave. Under the alias White Worm, she leads a network of spies and informants active in King's Landing.
Biography
Background
Originally a slave from Essos, Mysaria eventually found herself in Westeros, where she worked her way up the ranks in the criminal underbelly of King's Landing, to become the most trusted ally of Prince Daemon Targaryen,[1] as well as his paramour.[2][3]
House of the Dragon: Season 1
After being chastised by King Viserys and the Small Council for his extreme actions with the City Watch, Daemon goes to visit Mysaria. When his worries prevent him from completing their lovemaking, Mysaria comforts him, reminding him that Viserys can't replace him.[2]
After the death of Queen Aemma and Prince Baelon, Mysaria congratulates Daemon on being the king's sole heir once again, and proposes a toast. She and the gold cloaks listen as Daemon makes a speech.[2]
When Daemon is sent away from King's Landing by Viserys, Mysaria accompanies him, and goes for a ride on Caraxes with him.[2] She joins Daemon on Dragonstone when he occupies it.[3]
After Daemon steals a dragon egg, Mysaria is present at the confrontation between him and Otto Hightower. Upon learning that Daemon had falsely announced, without her knowledge, that they were to be wed, and that she was pregnant, Mysaria storms off and returns to the castle. When Daemon returns, she confronts him on his lies, reminding him that he swore to protect her, and that by using her as a pawn in his games, he is putting her in danger. She tells him that she came to him not out of a desire for gold, power, or station, but simply to be liberated from fear, and then she leaves.[3]
In the following years, Mysaria picks up a new profession, as she builds up a spy network on the streets of King's Landing, donning the alias "The White Worm." One night, one of her spies sees Prince Daemon and Princess Rhaenyra in a pleasure den together, and informs her. She finds Daemon unconscious and hungover, and watches over him until he wakes, while paying the spy for reporting the information to Otto Hightower. When Daemon wakes, she gives him something to help with his greensickness, but he refuses help from "a common whore." Satisfied that Daemon is safe, Mysaria leaves him.[4]
Years later, following King Viserys's last supper with the members of both factions of House Targaryen, Talya delivers information about the royal family to Mysaria.[5]
Understanding that King Viserys is soon to perish, Mysaria arranges to kidnap Prince Aegon, taking advantage of his inebriated state, and has him hidden beneath an altar in the Grand Sept. She sends her collaborator Jayne to offer the location of the missing prince to Arryk and Erryk Cargyll and demand a meeting with the Hand of the King. Ser Otto acquiesces and the two meet outside a pot-shop. Mysaria takes the gold brought by Ser Otto and then demands that the crown to bring down the establishments in Flea Bottom that exploit poor children, forcing them into fight rings or prostitution. She also throws a not-so-subtle barb at Otto; she knows it's his manipulations that are pushing Aegon towards the throne, that she could easily have had him killed, and reminds Otto that the common people are not to be discounted as a powerful force. While Otto seems to take these words to heart, Mysaria's manse is later set on fire by an agent of the Lord Confessor, Larys Strong, with the approval of Queen Alicent Hightower.[6]
Personality
Mysaria is strong-willed and cunning. She is against the abuse of children in Flea Bottom.[7]

Behind the scenes
Mysaria was revealed to be a recurring character in House of the Dragon on December 8, 2020. On February 11, 2021, HBO announced that Sonoya Mizuno had signed on for the series. The character breakdown reads as follows:
- "She came to Westeros with nothing, sold more times than she can recall, and she could have wilted... but instead she rose to become the most trusted – and most unlikely – ally of Prince Daemon Targaryen, the heir to the throne."
- ―HBO
In the books
In The World of Ice & Fire and Fire & Blood, Mysaria is a dancer from Lys. Prince Daemon met her in a brothel at King's Landing, and soon she became his lover and collaborator. She was lithe and lissome in her youth, but age thickened her body. She is described as an albino, hence (among other reasons) her derogatory nickname Misery, the White Worm.
After King Viserys declared Rhaenyra as his rightful heir, the furious Daemon left for Dragonstone and took Mysaria with him. They remained there for six months, during which time Mysaria became pregnant; when Daemon learned of her pregnancy, he gave her a dragon egg, and by that infuriated Viserys. Viserys commanded him to return the egg, send his whore away, and return to his lawful wife, or else be attainted as a traitor. Daemon reluctantly obeyed.
Mysaria was sent (eggless) back to Lys, and miscarried her child during a storm on the narrow sea. When Daemon heard about that, he spoke no syllable of grief, but his heart hardened against his brother.
The TV version in House of the Dragon changed this to make her Asian in appearance - apparently a slave passed along the shipping lanes from Yi Ti or Leng in the Further East - or perhaps the descendant of slaves from the Further East. TV-Mysaria says she simply doesn't remember her original homeland, and thus may have been born into slavery.

Prince Daemon Targaryen[N 2] is a prince of the Targaryen dynasty, and the younger brother of King Viserys I Targaryen. He is the uncle of Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen, and later becomes her second husband and king consort.
He is a peerless warrior, and also a dragonrider: his mount is Caraxes, the Blood Wyrm.
Biography
Background
Daemon is the grandson of Jaehaerys I Targaryen, younger brother of King Viserys, and heir presumptive to the Iron Throne. Ser Otto Hightower, the Hand of the King, considers Daemon the greatest threat to the realm.[3] He is the rider of the dragon Caraxes, an older dragon known as the Blood Wyrm. An experienced and skilled fighter, he wields Dark Sister, the Valyrian steel sword of his grandfather's great aunt Visenya Targaryen. Unlike his older brother, Daemon is - despite his great cunning - an unpredictable and impulsive rogue.
At the Great Council of 101 AC, Viserys was chosen by the lords of Westeros as the successor to King Jaehaerys, whose health had begun to fail and who had lost both his sons. During the first nine years of his brother's reign, Daemon served on the Small Council, both as Master of Laws and later as Master of Coin. However, he was removed from those offices, both times at the insistence of Otto Hightower. The rivalry between Daemon and Otto continued, as the Hand saw the prince as a threat if he were to ever become king, possibly a second Maegor the Cruel. Daemon in turn saw Otto as a dishonorable leech who wanted to rise as high as he could get, since his status as a second son would not allow him to inherit anything of his own. Most of the council sided with Otto in this conflict, but Daemon was always defended by his brother.
At some point King Viserys arranged a marriage for his younger brother, wedding him to Rhea Royce, the Lady of Runestone. Neither party was happy with this match, with Daemon disparagingly referring to his wife as his "bronze bitch".
Daemon's personal coat of arms features the three-headed red dragon of House Targaryen, adorned with golden scales and within a border of golden fire. His helmet, forged from Valyrian steel, is adorned with the head and wings of a dragon.[4]
House of the Dragon: Season 1
Daemon returns to King's Landing following a journey and his niece Rhaenyra greets him in the Red Keep's throne room while he is sitting on the Iron Throne. As a gift from his travels, he presents her with a necklace made of Valyrian steel and fastens it upon her. With Daemon wielding the Valyrian steel sword Dark Sister, he claims that they now both own a small piece of their heritage.[1]
That night, he leads the City Watch of King's Landing in a ruthless show of force, gathering the city's criminals and administering brutal summary justice; Daemon himself personally beheads an accused murderer with Dark Sister. In a Small Council meeting the next day, Daemon is accosted by Otto for the mass violence he has inflicted, to which Daemon defends his actions as necessary measures to ensure safety to the nobility arriving for Viserys's tournament. Otto then insinuates that he could perhaps show the same dedication he showed to the City Watch towards his wife, leading Daemon to insult both his own and Otto's late wife in retaliation. Before the argument can escalate further, Viserys defuses the tension, while reminding Daemon that another similar show of force will not be tolerated.[1]
While making love to his mistress Mysaria, Daemon grows frustrated at the treatment he is being given by Viserys and the members of the Small Council. Mysaria soothes his irritation and reminds him that given his power and reputation, Viserys cannot easily replace him.[1]
During the Heir's Tournament, Daemon competes to represent House Targaryen, where he quickly proves his worth as a skilled fighter, even taking the chance to mock Otto further by defeating his son Gwayne and earning his daughter Alicent's favor. However, he is defeated in a joust by Ser Criston of the minor House Cole. Enraged, he demands his squire deliver Dark Sister to him to continues the battle in a duel. Though he initially gains the upper hand, Criston defeats Daemon when he turns his back on him, leading Daemon to storm off.[1]
When Queen Aemma dies after in an attempt to save her child Baelon, as well as the child's death shortly after, Daemon is present during their funeral. Though he can plainly see Rhaenyra's anger towards Viserys, Daemon urges her to support him nonetheless, believing he needs her more than ever. In a Small Council meeting later on, Daemon watches the council unseen in the shadows, hearing Otto's insistence that he cannot be heir to the Iron Throne, lest he become a second Maegor the Cruel. Some time later he hosts officers of the City Watch at a brothel, where he raises a toast to his late nephew Baelon.[1]
Daemon is later summoned by Viserys to the Great Hall, where his brother questions him on his naming of Baelon as the "Heir for a Day." Seeing his brother's anger, Daemon insists that it was his own way of showing grief. When Viserys becomes furious at how he neglected to comfort him and Rhaenyra during their family's tragedy, Daemon retaliates by stating that he had only ever tried to cast him away, such as sending him to the Vale and making him commander of the City Watch, instead of being Hand of the King. Viserys grows angrier at the notion but Daemon believes he should inherently become his Hand as his brother. Viserys says that Otto is a better Hand that he could ever be, leading Daemon to call his brother weak and insult the Small Council as leeches who plainly know it as well. Viserys then disinherits him as his heir and orders to return to the Vale; Daemon tries to approach him but is stopped by the Kingsguard ready to defend Viserys, leading him to walk away in silent fury.[1]
As Viserys names Rhaenyra the new heir to the Iron Throne, Daemon is instead at the Dragonpit with Mysaria and his dragon Caraxes. Angered at Viserys denying him his right to the throne, he leaves King's Landing with his mistress atop the Blood Wyrm, making his way to Dragonstone.[1]
For half a year, Daemon takes control of Dragonstone, with the City Watch as his personal army. It is also revealed that he has stolen a dragon egg from the Dragonpit, intending to place it in the cradle of the child he has with Mysaria. When Otto is dispatched by Viserys to confront him on Dragonstone, along with several Kingsguard and Otto's own guards, Daemon refuses to back down and draws Dark Sister on the Hand, prompting both sides to unsheathe their weapons. As tensions rise, Caraxes appears from behind to defend his master, forcing Otto to command his guards to sheathe their swords.[5]
Daemon is then personally confronted by Rhaenyra, who has defied her father's orders to stay and ridden Syrax to Dragonstone. Knowing he is angry at being denied his place as Viserys' heir, she goads him into killing her in order to get what he desires. Unwilling to harm his niece, Daemon relinquishes the dragon egg to her and walks back to the castle with Mysaria and his men. Inside, she chastises Daemon for lying about their marriage and her supposed pregnancy, as well as relaying her fear that she will be punished for his actions since he is safe as the prince, but she is a common whore.[5]
Following Viserys's refusal to marry his daughter and his unwillingness to help with the threat of the Triarchy, Corlys Velaryon approaches Daemon and invites him to Driftmark. Corlys speaks of House Velaryon's ancient history and relations to Old Valyria like House Targaryen, as well as how they are both alike in the sense of them both being seen as lesser than their older brothers. Bored with his discussion about families, Daemon questions him for the true reason he is at Driftmark. The former Master of Ships talks about the looming threat of the Crabfeeder, how he has grown powerful thanks to aid from the Free Cities and how his House could be crippled when the shipping lanes of the Stepstones falls, speaking about Viserys's weakness.[5]
Daemon makes it clear that only he is allowed to speak freely about the king, and him alone. Corlys says that if he were to help him with this conflict, he could prove his worth in the eyes of those still seeing him as less than his brother. Hearing Corlys state that their worth is not given but made, Daemon agrees to aid his house with the Crabfeeder.[5]
The next three years come as a fruitless struggle for Daemon, Corlys, and their men, as the Crabfeeder, Craghas Drahar, and his Triarchy forces continue to hold the Stepstones in their control. Even Caraxes is not a weapon they could use to turn the conflict in their favor, as the numerous caves of the Stepstones allow Drahar and his men to avoid the dragonfire. News of their rising defeat spread far and wide, leading many to wonder if Viserys should send his own armies to win his brother's seemingly lost war.[6]
Even amongst their own forces, trust looms thin: Vaemond Velaryon, brother of Corlys, only sees Daemon as the reason to why they are losing and openly questions why they should serve him, just as the prince arrives at the war council. As Daemon stares quietly at his men, who all wonder who, for their newest plan, will offer themselves as bait at a strategic point on Bloodstone, a messenger from King's Landing appears. Daemon is handed a letter by the young man, and he reads its contents: Viserys plans to send 10 ships and 2,000 men in order to help win the war. He only sees this as his brother bailing him out of his own fight and furiously attacks the messenger with his helmet, needing to be restrained by Vaemond, Joffrey Lonmouth, and Corlys's son Laenor.[6]
Using a small rowboat, Daemon rows across from their position to Bloodstone, walks through the war-torn beach, fashions a crude white flag, and waves it in front of the caves. Drahar emerges from his cave and sees him; looking to the sky and seeing no dragon for an ambush, he sends his men out to investigate if they have truly surrendered. Daemon draws Dark Sister and offers it to them on one knee. One soldier takes up the sword and inspects it, only for Daemon to suddenly draw his dagger, cut down the man, and reclaim his weapon. He proceeds to kill all of the approaching soldiers and simultaneously dodges a volley of arrows from above, as he makes his way closer and closer to the edge of the caves, causing Drahar to send out more men.[6]
Though he gets close, Daemon is hit by three arrows and forced to halt his charge. Still not seeing a dragon above, Drahar orders the rest of his men to surround Daemon. Before he can be killed by the overwhelming number of soldiers, Laenor arrives and burns away the soldiers with his dragon Seasmoke, saving Daemon and further allowing the Velaryon forces to charge in and cut down the remaining soldiers. As Seasmoke blasts away the cliffside archers and the last of the Triarchy soldiers are locked in battle, Daemon spots Drahar fleeing into his cave and pursues him inside. Moments later, he emerges from the cave, holding the bisected corpse of the Crabfeeder.[6]
After the war, Daemon flies back to King's Landing on Caraxes, inadvertently rocking a ship Rhaenyra is on. Once he reaches the throne room, he haughtily makes his way to Viserys, holding Drahar's hammer and wearing a crown. He offers the hammer of his foe to be added to the Iron Throne. Viserys sees his crown and asks if he styles himself king as well, to which Daemon responds that he was named "King of the Narrow Sea" following their victory against the Triarchy. Nonetheless, he announces that there is only one true king: his brother. Daemon offers the crown on one knee; Viserys takes it and commands him to rise, before hugging his younger brother, welcoming him back.[7]
At a celebration in honor of his return, Daemon playfully argues with Viserys over who was the favorite of their mother, to which Viserys states it has always been Daemon for his rebellious attitude and skill as a warrior. Rhaenyra approaches them and congratulates her uncle on his victory, while Alicent asks if Daemon would like a tour to see new tapestries, causing Viserys and Daemon to laugh uproariously at the silly notion.[7]
At the end of the celebration, Daemon meets with Rhaenyra, who asks him the real reason he has returned. Daemon answers that he had returned for the comforts of home, though she remains unsure if he truly finds comfort in King's Landing. Their conversation's attention turns to Rhaenyra's growing ire at her father for trying to force her into marriage. In High Valyrian, they talk about marriage being nothing but a political arrangement, though Rhaenyra notes it is also a death sentence for women, revealing her worry that she will end up like her mother. Daemon states Aemma's death was simply a tragedy, and in a tragic world, Rhaenyra cannot allow fear to control her life.[7]
In the evening, he has an outfit and the plan of a secret passage in his niece's apartments deposited. She joins him dressed as a page and they walk around town. They attend a theatrical performance mocking the royal family during which he watches his niece's reaction. Daemon points out to her that the common people prefer her half-brother to her as heir because of his gender and tells her that the people's opinion matters. Rhaenyra then steals food from a merchant and Daemon follows her through the city and catches up with her when Ser Harwin Strong intercepts the princess. He then takes her to a brothel to show her the pleasures of the flesh. Tension builds between them and they end up kissing. Daemon begins to undress her and Rhaenyra urges him to go further, but Daemon grows increasingly reluctant and stops, abandoning his niece in the middle of the night.[7]
The next morning, Daemon is awakened by Mysaria who offers him a drink to help with his green-sickness, which he refuses and rejects her protection. Mysaria informs her that she is no longer a prostitute. She tells him to pay for his room when he leaves and leaves him.[7]
Back at the castle, he is stopped by two guards and brought into the throne room. Viserys is here, and asks his brother if he defiled his daughter then kicks him. Daemon does not deny. Viserys lets out his anger against him because Rhaenyra can no longer be his heiress if she is no longer "intact." Daemon asks him to wed her to him and reminds him that Viserys promised him everything he wanted after his return. Viserys retorts that he is already married and Daemon argues that he can do what their ancestor Aegon the Conqueror did and have two wives. Viserys flatly refuses, believing that his brother desires his throne. Viserys orders him to return to his legitimate wife in the Vale and never to appear before him again.[7]
Daemon, back in the Vale of Arryn, surprises his wife Rhea Royce hunting. She provokes him, and Daemon approaches her horse. Rhea, believing she understands her husband's intentions, who is to kill her so he can marry Rhaenyra, tries to catch her bow, but her horse arches, causing the young woman to fall and find herself paralyzed on the ground. Daemon checks her condition then leaves. Rhea taunts him one last time, calling him a "craven". Daemon picks up a stone and walks towards her.[8]
Uninvited, Daemon shows up at Rhaenyra Targaryen's wedding and takes a seat at the royal table. Soon after, Gerold Royce confronts the prince and accuses him of murder. Daemon warns him that he will have to prove his charges and informs him that he intends to go to the Vale to collect his wife's inheritance. Then, he meets Laena Velaryon's gaze then joins her on the dance floor where the young woman flatters and entices him. Daemon then heads off with his niece and walks away from the dance floor with her. He tries to convince her not to marry Laenor but rather him. Rhaenyra challenges him to take her to Dragonstone and marry her. Daemon disappears during Criston Cole's assault on Laenor's lover.[8]
Ten years later, Daemon now lives in Pentos with his family. With his second wife Laena, they demonstrate the power of their dragons. In the evening, he dines with the family with his wife, his daughters Baela, Rhaena and with Prince Reggio Haratis who toasts Aegon the Conqueror then offers them permanent residence in Pentos and land in exchange for their air support against the Triarchy. When Laena is about to refuse, Daemon grabs her hand and informs the prince that they will think about it.
After the meal, Daemon teaches Baela the High Valyrian. Laena joins him and asks him if he intends to accept the proposal. The prince wants to accept and no longer wants to interfere in the Westeros plot. Laena replies that they are just guests; she refuses to be a pawn and tells him of her wish to return to Driftmark to give birth, that their daughters receive the education they deserve, and that she wishes to die as a dragonrider.
The next evening, Laena brings Daemon the news from King's Landing and tells him that Rhaenyra has given birth to a third son. She tries to convince him again to return by pointing out that he does not go out in the city and is content to read books to the glory of his house. Laena first thinks that her husband's behavior is her fault because she is not the woman he desired and he did not have the life he wanted. Laena tells him that she got used to this idea and that Daemon is better than he thinks.
A few days later, Laena gives birth but cannot get her baby out. The surgeon informs Daemon that he can't do anything except perform a caesarean section without being sure that the child will be alive. Daemon asks if the mother will survive, the surgeon says no. Daemon does not make a decision and realizes that his wife has disappeared. He follows her to the beach and sees her helplessly being consumed by Vhagar at her command. The next day, he shows Laena's remains to their daughters from the ramparts then leave.
Following Laena's death, her body is brought back to Driftmark where her funeral takes place. Vaemond Velaryon is in charge of the funeral speech during which Daemon laughs at his reflection on the blood. During the snack that follows, Daemon stays away from the others, but exchanges glances with Rhaenyra and Viserys. His brother ends up coming to see him. Daemon sees the damage of the disease on his brother. Viserys offers him to return with him to King's Landing but Daemon refuses considering that Pentos is his new home. Viserys insists but Daemon flatly refuses and leaves his brother and the place.
After the funeral, Daemon talks with Rhaenyra on the beach. The princess tells his uncle about her situation with Laenor which is spiraling out of control and not even trying to keep up appearances unlike her. Rhaenyra explains to him that they tried to conceive a child, but without joy or success. She then reveals that Ser Harwin Strong is indeed the father of her three children. Rhaenyra confides that she trusted him and regrets not having held him back. Daemon believes the Hightowers are responsible for the Strong's deaths. Rhaenyra then blames Daemon for having abandoned her and that her life has become a "droll tragedy". The prince retorts that he spared her because she was just a child. She then questions him about his relationship with Laena. Daemon tells her they were "happy enough" and Rhaenyra offers her condolences. The princess then kisses him, telling her that she is no longer a child. The two go to take refuge in an abandoned wooden wreck on the beach and make love for the first time.
Soon after, they return to the castle where they find that their children have fought with Aemond Targaryen. They listen to the children and then Alicent and Rhaenyra argue until Viserys asks for peace. When Alicent attempts to attack Lucerys Velaryon and his mother protects him, Daemon stops Criston Cole who is heading towards the Queen. After Alicent wounds Rhaenyra with the Valyrien steel dagger, Daemon closes in on Rhaenyra and faces Alicent.
The day after, Daemon reunites with Rhaenyra. The princess offers to marry her according to Targaryen customs, in order to consolidate her place as heir to the throne. With the complicity of Ser Qarl Correy, they fake Laenor's death. Daemon kills a guard resembling the Heir of Driftmark while Qarl and Laenor pretend to quarrel in front of a servant. After Laenor's "death", Daemon and Rhaenyra marry at Dragonstone in front of their children and Maester Gerardys according to Targaryen customs. They cut their lips and the palm of their hand with a steel knife, mix their blood and drink it from a cup.
Personality
In many aspects, Daemon is the opposite of his kind and peaceful brother: he is fierce, unpredictable, and brave.[9] Much like Jaime Lannister (prior to his maiming) and Oberyn Martell, he is rash, arrogant, aggressive, and quarrelsome, wouldn't miss a chance for war,[5] and is not above committing a cold-blooded murder[8] if it suits his interests. He prefers to resolve conflicts by force rather than diplomacy.[10] However, Daemon is very loyal to his family as he loves his brother, Rhaenyra, and his children above all else.
Family tree
1 Jaehaerys had thirteen children in all. For simplicity, only the direct ancestors of future generations are on this family tree and they are not in the exact order of birth. The thirteen children in correct order are: Aegon, Daenerys, Aemon, Baelon, Alyssa, Maegelle, Vaegon, Daella, Saera, Viserra, Gaemon, Valerion, and Gael.
2 While Jacaerys, Lucerys, and Joffrey are officially Laenor's, he and Rhaenyra never had any biological issue. His three sons are in fact fathered by Harwin Strong.

- "It has been said that Rhaenyra's greatest weapon was not her dragons, but her husband, Daemon. An expert on the battlefield, as well as an accomplished strategist. 'The Rogue Prince' as he had been called, was one of the most feared men of his day."

Behind the scenes
Daemon Targaryen was revealed to be a lead character in House of the Dragon on August 17, 2020. On December 11, 2020, HBO announced that Matt Smith had signed on for the series. The character breakdown reads as follows:
- "The younger brother to King Viserys and heir to the throne. A peerless warrior and a dragonrider, Daemon possesses the true blood of the dragon. But it is said that whenever a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin in the air…"
- ―HBO
In the books
Daemon was a controversial man in his lifetime, an audacious rogue prince and adventurer who seemed composed of good and evil in equal measure. There was never a man simultaneously so loved and so reviled as he was. To some he was a hero, to others the blackest of villains.
Younger son of Baelon Targaryen, Daemon became one of the most experienced warriors of his generation with his constant fighting and was knighted at the age of sixteen. His grandfather King Jaehaerys I Targaryen gave him the Valyrian steel sword Dark Sister. Daemon rode the dragon Caraxes, a powerful beast who he flew in his constant campaigns in the Stepstones, soon becoming the most battle-hardened of the Targaryen dragons. Caraxes's might in battle was enough to match even the mighty Vhagar, the largest of the dragons and the last of the three that had been brought to Westeros by Aegon the Conqueror and his sisters.
Daemon served on his brother Viserys I's Small Council for a time, as Master of Coin and Master of Laws, but grew bored of such administrative work, and became the new Lord Commander of the City Watch. He reorganized the Watch from a loosely assembled and poorly equipped group of street toughs into the formal institution they were known as ever since, giving them their trademark gold cloaks. Daemon vigorously enforced order in the alleys of the city, but was also a well-known rabble-rouser, socializing with the city's dregs as long as they played by his rules. His face became known to every cut-purse, whore, and gambler in Flea Bottom.
On several major occasions Daemon clashed with his brother over the matter of succession, only to reconcile with him later. At the beginning of Viserys I's reign, Daemon wanted to be named as heir ahead of his brother's only child, his daughter Rhaenyra. The Great Council of 101 AC that had put Viserys on the throne ahead of his cousin Rhaenys favored male proximity over primogeniture, so Daemon assumed he would be named heir ahead of his niece Rhaenyra, much as his father Baelon had been named heir ahead of his niece Rhaenys. Daemon's behavior was so wild and unpredictable, however, that while Viserys still loved his brother, he hesitated to formally name him as the official heir to the throne.

- ―Harrold resigns from his post
Ser Harrold Westerling is a knight of House Westerling. He was the Lord Commander of Viserys I Targaryen's Kingsguard following the death of Ser Ryam Redwyne.[2]
Biography
Background
Harrold is one of the longest-serving members of the Kingsguard. He was once a powerful knight with a successful military background. He was named to the Kingsguard during the reign of Jaehaerys I. King Viserys has assigned him to Rhaenyra Targaryen as a sworn shield.[3]
House of the Dragon: Season 1
At the Dragonpit Harrold welcomes back Princess Rhaenyra, who has just returned from a ride on her dragon Syrax. When Rhaenyra asks him not to look so relieved, he responds that he is relieved every time her golden dragon brings her back unharmed as it saves his head from a spike. He escorts the carriage the princess and Alicent Hightower travel in back to the Red Keep.[4]
Harrold tells Rhaenyra that her uncle Prince Daemon has secretly returned to the Red Keep. Leading the princess into the Great Hall, he is shocked to find Daemon sitting on the Iron Throne, with Rhaenyra reassuring him that it is alright.[4]
Harrold guards the princess in the royal box during the Heir's Tournament. He informs Rhaenyra about Ser Criston Cole, stating that he only knows that he is the common-born son of Lord Dondarrion's steward and that he just unhorsed both Baratheon challengers in the tournament.[4]
Harrold is present with his Kingsguard brothers at the funeral of Queen Aemma and Prince Baelon as they are cremated by Syrax's flames.[4]
Harrold protects King Viserys in the Great Hall when he confronts his brother Daemon about dubbing Baelon the "Heir for a Day." He draws his sword and moves to block Daemon's path when he tries to step toward the king seated on the Iron Throne.[4]
Harrold is present with his Kingsguard brothers at the ceremony naming Rhaenyra as Princess of Dragonstone and heir to the Iron Throne.[4]
After Ser Ryam Redwyne's death, Harrold is appointed Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.[5]
During the funeral of Laena Velaryon, Harrold gently corrects Viserys when he mistakenly refers to Alicent as "Aemma." He later breaks up the fight between the royal children, declaring his horror at Prince Aemond's maiming. While Viserys attempts to learn the truth of what happened, Harrold remains silently on guard, only breaking to glare at Criston when he snickers at a comment by Queen Alicent regarding Laenor Velaryon. As Alicent moves to attack Prince Lucerys, Harrold attempts to keep order, ordering the Kingsguard back, and ordering Criston to be restrained when he attempts to assist the queen.[6]
Six years after the events on Driftmark, Harrold arranges a welcome for Rhaenyra and Daemon.[7]
After the death of King Viserys, Harrold and Criston stand guard at the small council as they discuss what is to happen next. When Criston kills Lyman Beesbury, Harrold draws his sword and demands he stand down and remove his cloak. Criston defiantly draws his sword in response and only backs down when Alicent commands him to. Harrold continues to stand guard in disbelief until Otto commands him to go to Dragonstone to assassinate Rhaenyra, causing Harrold to remove his cloak and resign from his post.[8]
Personality
Harrold is chivalrous and honorable.[9] He is loyal to King Viserys and Princess Rhaenyra.[1]
Behind the scenes
Harrold Westerling was revealed to be a recurring character in House of the Dragon on December 8, 2020. On September 24, 2021, HBO announced that Graham McTavish had signed on for the series. The character breakdown reads as follows:
- "Ser Harrold has served in the Kingsguard since the days of King Jaehaerys; he is a paragon of chivalry and honor."
- ―HBO
In the episode "The Green Council," Harrold's confrontation with Criston Cole originally included a moment in which he would have told Criston: "The rats in the Red Keep have more honor than you." According to McTavish, he was disappointed that the line hadn't made the final cut but understood the likely reasoning that someone as ill-tempered as Criston Cole would have likely reacted more violently to such an insult, thus affecting the plot significantly.[10]
In the books
Harrold is only briefly mentioned in one sentence of Fire & Blood, and he hasn't been mentioned in the main A Song of Ice and Fire novels.
It is unclear how Harrold is related to Johanna Westerling, who marries Lord Jason Lannister to become Lady of Casterly Rock and a fairly prominent recurring character.
In 112 AC, Harrold Westerling actually died of old age in the middle of Viserys's reign, two years before the wedding of Rhaenyra and Laenor. Thus the TV-version of Harrold seems to have been condensed together with aspects of one or two of the other Kingsguard members in this time period.
Coincidentally, in the books both Harrold Westerling and Grand Maester Runciter died within months of each other, after which Mellos was appointed to replace Runciter - and thus Harrold never met Mellos. Teaser trailers have revealed that the TV version merged Runciter and Mellos into one character named "Mellos", who is therefore Grand Maester at the beginning of Viserys's reign. The result is that "TV-Mellos" has been expanded to appear earlier than he did in the books, while "TV-Harrold" has been expanded to appear later than he did in the books, and they now overlap with each other. The second teaser trailer clearly shows Mellos and Harrold standing next to each other at an event early in Viserys's reign.

- ―Alicent Hightower
Queen Alicent Hightower is the second wife of King Viserys I Targaryen and daughter of Ser Otto Hightower, the Hand of the King.
Biography
Background
Alicent Hightower is the daughter of Ser Otto Hightower, the Hand of the King. She has a number of brothers, the eldest being Ser Gwayne Hightower. From an early age, she has lived in the Red Keep and grown up among the royal family.[2]
House of the Dragon: Season 1
At the Dragonpit Alicent greets Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen, who has just returned from a ride on her dragon Syrax. Rhaenyra asks her if she would like to accompany her on dragonback sometime, but she politely declines. Alicent travels with the princess back to the Red Keep by carriage. Alicent and Rhaenyra pay a visit to a heavily pregnant Queen Aemma in her chambers.[3]
Later that day Alicent tries to go over a history book with Rhaenyra in the godswood of the Red Keep but at first she isn't interested, until Alicent brings up the approaching birth of King Viserys and Queen Aemma's child which she states could overshadow her and displace the princess's position in the line of succession, if it's a boy. Alicent is shocked when Rhaenyra rips a page from the book, warning the princess that Septa Marlow won't be happy. Rhaenyra responds with profanity and states she doesn't care about the septa, then they both laugh about it as they walk arm in arm.[3]
Alicent sits beside the princess in the royal box at the Heir's Tournament. She informs Rhaenyra about House Cole of the Stormlands and she whispers to Rhaenyra about court gossip involving the betrothal of Lady Elinor Stokeworth and a young Massey squire, alleging that Elinor is already with child. Alicent is anxious when Prince Daemon Targaryen chooses her eldest brother, Ser Gwayne Hightower, as his first opponent in the joust, biting her fingernails until Rhaenyra grabs her hand reassuringly. She is frightened, putting her hand to her mouth, when Daemon trips Gwayne's horse, throwing him from the saddle and injuring his face. Daemon then asks Alicent for her favor, to which she obliges. She looks to her father, Ser Otto, before placing a laurel wreath on Daemon's lance. She is later amazed to discover that Ser Criston Cole is Dornish.[3]
Alicent attends the funeral of Queen Aemma and Prince Baelon.[3]
Alicent is later summoned to the Tower of the Hand by her father. She is embraced by Otto and is asked about how Rhaenyra is coping with her mother and brother's deaths, then is told to go and offer her condolences to the grieving king in his chambers, being told to stop biting her fingernails and to wear one of her mother's dresses.[3]
Alicent is escorted into King Viserys's chambers by the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, Ser Ryam Redwyne. She brings her favorite history book with her as the king is passionate about the subject, for which Viserys thanks her. After a moment's silence she brings up her own mother's death stating that people only spoke to her in riddles, wishing someone had only said sorry to her for what had happened. She offers her condolences to the king for what happened to his wife and son.[3]
Alicent and her father are in attendance at the ceremony naming Rhaenyra as Princess of Dragonstone and heir to the Iron Throne.[3]
At her father's urging, Alicent becomes closer to the king, and spends time with him privately, during which she learns a lot about Old Valyria from him, and the two do indeed become close. She does not inform Rhaenyra of this growing bond, knowing the potential disastrous consequences of such a revelation.[4]
Alicent visits a sept with Rhaenyra, and offers her reassurance on her doubts about her father and his choice of her as his heir. The two pray to the Mother, with Alicent teaching Rhaenyra how to do so. Alicent confesses to Rhaenyra that this is the only way she feels close to her mother.[4]
Viserys informs Alicent that Lord Corlys Velaryon has offered his daughter, Laena Velaryon, as a marriage proposal to him. Though unhappy with this news, Alicent nonetheless assures Viserys that Laena would be a good match for him. She then reveals that she had the stonemasons fix a dragon model that he had broken earlier. Viserys thanks her for the gift.[4]
As her father prepares to leave for Dragonstone to retrieve a dragon egg stolen by Prince Daemon, Alicent helps him dress, and he notices the skin around her fingers, which she had picked at in her anxiety. He asks her why she, as the most comely girl at court, damages her own hands, and inquires if she will be visiting the king tonight, which she agrees to do if it pleases him.[4]
Alicent is summoned to a Small Council meeting, where Viserys announces his intention to marry her. Alicent looks guiltily at Rhaenyra, who, furious at this secret being kept from her, storms out of the chamber.[4]
Alicent and Viserys marry and Alicent soon gives birth to her first son, Prince Aegon.[5]
Two years later, a royal hunt is organized to celebrate Aegon’s second nameday, and Alicent is pregnant again. As the hunting party prepares for departure, Rhaenyra is noticeably missing, and Alicent, knowing where she most likely is, goes to the godswood of the Red Keep, where Rhaenyra is reading and being serenaded by a minstrel named Samwell. Alicent dismisses Samwell, overriding Rhaenyra’s insistence that he stay. She tries to make friendly overtures to her friend-turned-stepdaughter, but Rhaenyra is disinclined to listen and storms off.[5]
Alicent rides in the royal carriage with Viserys and Rhaenyra, on the road to the Kingswood, where the hunt is to be held. Alicent and Viserys try to make conversation, but Rhaenyra, still angry at both of them, refuses to participate.[5]
Upon arriving in the Kingswood, Alicent and Viserys emerge from their carriage with their baby Aegon, who several of the gathered lords and ladies, most notably, Alicent’s uncle, Lord Hobert Hightower, applaud and hail as the "second of his name."[5]
Alicent sits with the other ladies of the realm, including Ceira Lannister, Joselyn Redwyne, and Lynesse Hightower. They are joined by Larys Strong who, due to his clubfoot, is unfit for hunting, and thus wishes to sit with the ladies. They discuss the capture of Johanna Swann by the Triarchy, during the War for the Stepstones. Lady Ceira asks Rhaenyra, who has just shown up, for an update on the war, but she denies any knowledge. When Ceira implies that Rhaenyra is usurping Daemon’s place as Viserys’s heir, Alicent stands up for her friend, saying that she was more suited for the role than Daemon. Alicent listens silently as Lady Joselyn criticizes Viserys on his inaction regarding the Stepstones, and looks amused when Rhaenyra snaps back at her.[5]
That night, Alicent watches worriedly as Viserys drowns himself in wine. She joins him in front of a pyre, where he spills out his feelings to her, telling her about Targaryen dragon dreams, and about his own dream of placing his son upon the Iron Throne, expressing tremendous guilt over causing his wife's death in pursuit of that dream. He says he named Rhaenyra his heir as a means of setting things right, as he never imagined he would remarry and have a son. He wonders if he was wrong to name Rhaenyra his heir, though Alicent tries to assure him that he made the right choice.[5]
The next day, Alicent and the rest of the party watch in some surprise as Rhaenyra returns to the camp with a boar that she and Ser Criston Cole killed.[5]
After returning to King’s Landing from the hunt, Alicent is visited by her father, who points out how Aegon's birth has united the men, and ended fifteen years of uncertainty and doubt. He tells Alicent that she must convince Viserys to name Aegon his heir, as the realm would descend into chaos were Rhaenyra to be named instead of him, no matter how good a queen she may prove to be. Alicent is unhappy with the idea of raising Aegon to steal his sister's birthright.[5]
Alicent visits Viserys, but does not broach the topic of succession with him. Instead, they discuss the matter of Rhaenyra's betrothal, with Alicent telling Viserys that she will not marry unless she thinks it's by her own choice. Alicent discovers a letter Viserys was sent by Vaemond Velaryon, the brother of Lord Corlys, informing him that the fighting in the Stepstones is going poorly, and pleading for aid. Viserys is reluctant to send it, as to do so after so long would make him look weak, and remarks that he is forever doomed to anger one person in the pleasing of another. Alicent simplifies the problem for him: as king, Viserys must serve the realm, and the realm will only benefit if the Crabfeeder is vanquished. This sufficiently sways Viserys.[5]
Alicent later gives birth to a daughter,[6] named Helaena.[7]
Some time later, a feast is held in the godswood, in honor of Daemon’s victory in the Stepstones. Alicent listens as Viserys and Daemon exchange stories, and talk about their mother. Their conversation is joined by Rhaenyra, who is supposed to be on a tour to find a husband. In an attempt to break the awkward silence, Alicent asks Daemon if he would like to see the new tapestries from Norvos and Qohor on display in the gallery, but to her annoyance, Viserys laughs at this suggestion, as Daemon has no interest in such things.[6]
After Rhaenyra is tersely excused by her father, Alicent goes to sit with her. She points out that Rhaenyra is lucky to be able to choose her own husband, as most ladies don’t get that choice. Rhaenyra counters that the men wanting to marry her only want to do so for her bloodline, to advance their own status. When Alicent says she still thinks it sounds romantic, Rhaenyra blurts out that she doesn't see what's so romantic about marrying so she can be locked up in a castle and "made to squeeze out heirs." Alicent is wounded by this statement, as it exactly describes her situation in life. Rhaenyra grasps her hand and apologizes. Alicent informs Rhaenyra that Viserys is frustrated that she has come home after he went to great effort to arrange her tour. She, however, is glad that Rhaenyra has come home, as she feels she has few friends lately – most people only look at her as “The Queen” now. Rhaenyra responds that she has missed Alicent too, and the bond between the two is somewhat repaired.[6]
That night, as Viserys is taking a bath, Alicent dismisses the handmaidens so she can personally bathe Viserys’s new sores from sitting the throne. He comments that her touch feels far kinder than theirs. Later, Alicent receives a summons by Viserys. Though she quietly protests due to the lateness of the hour, she reluctantly joins him in his chambers where she endures boring, pleasureless sex with an ailing husband old enough to be her father. Alicent has a look of bored disinterest as they couple, though whenever Viserys does turn to her face she switches to a fake smile as a dutiful wife.[6]
The following morning, Alicent overhears her father Otto deliver troubling news to Viserys: Rhaenyra was seen in a brothel the previous night, “coupling” with her uncle Daemon. Shocked and hurt, she summons Rhaenyra to the godswood to confront her about it. Rhaenyra admits that Daemon took her out into the town last night, that they drank in several taverns, but she dismisses the claims that she did anything with Daemon as “a vile accusation”. Alicent expresses her doubts, claiming that Targaryens have “queer customs”, and insists that she only wants to help Rhaenyra. At this, Rhaenyra confesses that they did visit a brothel, as Daemon refused to take her home when she asked, but insists that she herself was only a spectator, and did nothing intimate with Daemon. She swears this on her mother’s memory. Alicent can tell that something is amiss, but believes that Rhaenyra is fundamentally telling the truth. She does, however, criticize Rhaenyra for being foolish enough to put herself in a situation where her virtue could have even come into question.[6]
Alicent joins a rattled Viserys on his balcony overlooking the city. She tells him about Rhaenyra denying having sex with Daemon, and points out that she isn't known for being deceitful, whereas Daemon rarely tells the full truth, thus he was likely lying when he told Viserys that he had sex with Rhaenyra. Viserys is baffled as to how Daemon claiming such things could possibly serve him, to which Alicent suggests that Daemon's entire goal was simply to taunt his older brother for disinheriting him. Viserys says that whatever happened, he can still sense that Rhaenyra is not innocent of any wrongdoing, and Alicent earnestly insists that Rhaenyra swore to her that she remains a maiden, and that she believes her.[6]
Alicent approaches her father as he leaves the city following his dismissal as Hand of the King, saying she doesn’t wish for him to leave, but she believes Rhaenyra’s claims of innocence, and insists that it was Otto’s own dogged determination in pushing Aegon as heir that ultimately led to his dismissal. Otto chides her on her naivety and presents her with the cold logic of the situation: When Viserys inevitably dies, Rhaenyra will have to kill Alicent's children whether she wants to or not, simply to ensure her own survival in the ensuing conflict. Alicent therefore has only two choices: either start plotting to secure her position at court against Rhaenyra, or fully commit to ingratiating herself with her stepdaughter and hope that when Rhaenyra takes the throne, this will make her merciful enough towards Alicent that she won't kill her half-siblings. Recognizing the truth of his words, Alicent can only break down in tears as her father embraces her.[8]
Alicent goes to the godswood for solitude, where she is surprised to find Larys Strong, who compares her to the Braavosi flowers that thrive in the garden despite being removed from their native climate. He offers his condolences on her father’s dismissal, and implies that Rhaenyra may have facilitated it. He slyly informs her that Rhaenyra was given a medicinal tea by Grand Maester Mellos, on Viserys’s instructions, the same night Otto was dismissed. Alicent realizes his unstated implication that Rhaenyra must have received Moon tea, and suspects that Rhaenyra may have been lying to her about not having sex with Daemon.[8]
After Viserys and Rhaenyra return to King’s Landing from their voyage to Driftmark to arrange a marriage between Rhaenyra and Laenor Velaryon, Alicent has Ser Criston Cole summoned to her chambers. As Rhaenyra’s sworn protector, she questions him about the rumour that Rhaenyra and Daemon had sex, but in her struggle to find the words to use, she never mentions Daemon by name. To her shock, Criston confesses that he himself had sex with Rhaenyra that night. He says that, while Rhaenyra instigated the encounter, it is still his own fault for going along with it, and requests that he be granted a swift execution for breaking his vows, rather than the gelding and drawn-out torture that by right the king will likely subject him to. Alicent is utterly stunned to learn of this, and realizes that her father was fundamentally right about Rhaenyra, despite getting the details wrong. Holding back tears, she thanks Criston for his honesty and tells him to return to his duties.[8]
A wedding is held for Rhaenyra and Laenor. Having decided to set herself against Rhaenyra in her pursuit of the throne, Alicent arrives late, deliberately interrupting Viserys’s speech, and wearing a green dress – the colour the flames in the Hightower burn when House Hightower calls its banners to war. She silently makes her way through the feast hall as all, save for Daemon, rise for her presence. When she reaches the high table she gives Viserys a curt peck on the cheek, and coldly congratulates Rhaenyra, referring to her only as "stepdaughter", making it clear that their friendship is over. She then coldly observes the festivities.[8]
As Rhaenyra and Laenor start dancing, followed by several others, Alicent goes over to her uncle, Lord Hobert, who praises her for standing tall out of her father’s shadow, and affirms Oldtown’s support of her.[8]
The wedding is suddenly interrupted, as a fight breaks out between Ser Criston Cole and Ser Joffrey Lonmouth. Alicent and the rest of the crowd watch in horror as Criston murders Joffrey by beating his face into a bloody pulp. Following this altercation, the guests are sent away and the seven days of festivities are cancelled. Rhaenyra and Laenor are instead quickly married in the messy throne room, with only Alicent, Viserys, Corlys Velaryon, Rhaenys Targaryen, and the new Hand of the King, Lyonel Strong, in attendance.[8]
Following the ceremony, Alicent goes to the godswood, where she finds Ser Criston preparing to take his own life in front of the weirwood tree, and calls out to him, preventing his suicide.[8]
Alicent later gives birth to a third child, named Aemond.[7]
Ten years after the wedding, Rhaenyra gives birth to her third son, and Alicent immediately orders the baby be brought to her at once. As both of Rhaenyra’s first two sons, Jacaerys and Lucerys, bear a striking resemblance to Ser Harwin Strong, Alicent suspects them to be bastards, and thus wants to examine the new baby before it can be switched out with another. Alicent is shocked to see Rhaenyra herself bring the baby to her, insisting that she should be resting after her labours, and has her sit. King Viserys then enters the room, now completely missing his left forearm due to the infection, and joyfully holds his new grandson. Alicent asks what they intend to name the baby, and Laenor interjects ahead of Rhaenyra that he will be named “Joffrey”, a name Alicent notes is unusual for a Velaryon. Alicent hands Joffrey over to Ser Laenor, taking note of the black hairs on the baby’s head, and whispers to Laenor "Do keep trying: soon or late, you may get one who looks like you."[7]
Later, Alicent sits with her daughter Helaena in her private chambers. Though clearly confused and bored, Alicent tries to feign interest as the highly introverted Helaena tells her about her insect collection. A Kingsguard then drags her son Aemond into the room. Seeing his blackened face, Alicent realizes that Aemond tried to claim a dragon again, and scolds him for his recklessness. Humiliated, Aemond tells her that the other boys dressed a pig up as a dragon and presented it to him. Alicent lovingly embraces her son.[7]
Alicent discusses the incident with Viserys, placing the blame on Rhaenyra’s sons, who she refers to as “savages”. Viserys gently chides that Aemond was foolish to think the other boys were capable of wrangling up some unclaimed young dragon for him on their own, and expresses suspicions that they may have been put up to it by Aemond's own elder brother Aegon. Alicent broaches the topic of Rhaenyra’s sons’ parentage, insisting that for Rhaenyra to have three bastard children is an insult to Viserys, House Velaryon, the throne, and decency itself. Viserys tells her a story about a black mare he had that mated with a silver stallion, and yet their foal was a chestnut brown. “Nature is a thing of mysterious works”, he tells her. Alicent points out that, unless he actually saw them mating, he can’t know that the brown foal was in fact theirs. Viserys, knowing the consequences of an implication such as Alicent suggests, refuses to speak of it any further.[7]
Alicent vents her frustrations to Ser Criston Cole. Viserys is being willfully blind to the obvious, the entire court already suspects that Rhaenyra's three sons are bastards, but none of them dare openly say it, and Rhaenyra shamelessly, and with impunity, continues to pursue her relationship with Ser Harwin, despite everyone knowing the truth, as her father will always make excuses for her. Criston himself then starts venting about Rhaenyra, likening her to a spider sucking its prey dry, and calling her “a spoiled cunt”. Alicent, disapproving of his language and attitude, glares at him, and he apologizes. She expresses her belief that honor and decency will prevail over Rhaenyra’s offenses in the end.[7]
Alicent enters young Aegon's private chamber, to find him standing naked and masturbating in a castle window. She demands to know if the pig incident was his idea, and though he initially tries to shift the blame to Rhaenyra’s sons, he admits that it was him, but brushes it off as just a funny prank. Moreso than the prank itself, Alicent is annoyed that Aegon worked with Rhaenyra’s children against his brother. Frustrated by her son’s short-sightedness, she reminds Aegon that as things stand, Jacaerys will be Rhaenyra’s heir, and as her own father once impressed on her, she tells him that Rhaenyra will kill both him and Aemond to secure her place on the throne. When Aegon innocently says that he won't challenge Rhaenyra, Alicent grabs his face and shouts that he is the challenge, simply by living and breathing. As the king’s firstborn son, his very existence is a threat to Rhaenyra’s claim.[7]
Alicent attends a meeting of the Small Council, where they discuss yet another border dispute between Houses Blackwood and Bracken, as well as new developments in the Stepstones, as the Triarchy have now allied with Dorne. She and Rhaenyra disagree on every issue, with Rhaenyra wanting to take a hands-on, interventionist approach, while Alicent prefers to delegate issues to the local lords, and denies Rhaenyra’s claims that they should have garrisoned and fortified the Stepstones before leaving, saying that they didn’t have the funds to do so. With their business finished for the day, the council rises to leave, but Rhaenyra asks them all to stay as she has another issue to address. The council all sit back down, except for Alicent who remains standing. Rhaenyra says that she is aware of the recent tension between her family and Alicent's, and apologizes for any offense she may have given. She reminds Alicent that they are all part of one house, and were friends before that. As a peace offering, she proposes a betrothal between her son and heir Jace and Alicent's daughter Helaena. Additionally, when her dragon Syrax produces a new clutch of eggs, she will gift one to Aemond. Though Viserys is happy with the proposal, Alicent is incredulous. She points out to Rhaenyra that breast milk is leaking through her dress, causing her to sit back down in embarrassment, and flatly says that she will consider the proposal.[7]
As Alicent and Viserys walk back to their chambers, Alicent dismisses Rhaenyra’s proposal as one born out of desperation, and says that it’s an insult to suggest she marry her daughter to Rhaenyra’s son, stopping just short of saying that it’s because Jace is a bastard. Viserys urges her to accept the proposal, as it will bring peace to the royal family, but Alicent sharply says that he can do what he wants when she's cold in her grave.[7]
They reach their chambers, where they are shortly joined by Lyonel Strong, who has come to offer his resignation as Hand of the King, as recent rumours have compromised his ability to give impartial counsel. Viserys insists that Lyonel tell him what these rumours are, and Alicent too demands honesty, hoping to hear him finally speak the truth they all know to Viserys. However, much to Alicent’s anger, Lyonel refuses to speak, and thus Viserys refuses to accept his resignation. He does, however, allow Lyonel to escort his son Harwin to Harrenhal, supposedly to prepare him for when he inherits it. After Lyonel leaves, Alicent also storms out.[7]
Alicent goes to her private chambers where she shares a lunch with Lyonel’s younger son, Larys Strong, who Alicent has come to rely on as an informant over the years. This time, however, it is her turn to inform him of the recent events: Larys's father refused to tell the king about Harwin's alleged affair with Rhaenyra, and so will remain as Hand, after escorting Harwin back to Harrenhal. Larys says that Viserys is being willfully blind to the truth about Rhaenyra’s children, and Alicent refutes his suggestion that she would do the same for her own children. Alicent laments her lack of allies at court, and says that she wishes her father Otto Hightower was there. Larys points out that her father wouldn't exactly be impartial in this matter, to which Alicent sharply says in frustration that he would be partial to her.[7]
Later, Alicent learns from Larys that both Lyonel and Harwin Strong were killed in a fire in Harrenhal, and quickly deduces that Larys himself is responsible. Larys tells her that he was simply fulfilling her own wish – with Lyonel gone, now she can call her father back as Hand. However, a horrified Alicent says that she didn’t wish for this. Unfazed, Larys expresses his confidence that she will reward him when the time is right, and Alicent can only stare in horror, knowing that if she doesn’t want her part in the murder exposed, she must comply with Larys’s wishes.[7]
Alicent and the rest of the royal court travel to Driftmark to attend the funeral of Laena Velaryon, her father Otto now reinstated as Hand of the King. During the service, Alicent exchanges a hard look with Rhaenyra.[9]
The court gathers at a cliffside courtyard of High Tide castle for the wake, which is filled with long awkward silences and strained conversations: Alicent and Rhaenyra’s families are gathered in one place for the first time since Rhaenyra departed King’s Landing for Dragonstone. The two women continue to glare at each other. Meanwhile, Larys Strong stares ceaselessly at Alicent, something Ser Criston takes note of and points out to her. Keeping her secrets, Alicent brushes it off, saying it’s merely a look of pride, as Larys is the new Lord of Harrenhal.[9]
Evening falls, and Viserys heads for bed. As he bids Alicent goodnight, he accidentally calls her “Aemma”, which visibly unnerves her.[9]
That night, Alicent and Viserys are woken, and brought into the Hall of Nine, due to an altercation between their son Aemond, Rhaeynyra’s sons Jace and Luke, and Daemon’s daughters Baela and Rhaena. The children got in a fight, during which Luke severely injured Aemond, slashing him across the eye. To Alicent’s horror, Maester Kelvyn informs her that, while the flesh will heal, the eye is lost forever. She angrily slaps Aegon, and berates him for drowning himself in wine instead of being there to defend his brother.[9]
The children begin to argue over who started the fight, but Viserys yells for silence, and demands Aemond tell the truth of what happened. Alicent has heard enough, however: Her son has been maimed at the hand of Rhaenyra’s. She scoffs at Rhaenyra’s claim that it was an accident, pointing out that Luke brought a blade to the fight. Rhaenyra says that Aemond called her sons bastards, and demands he be “sharply questioned” to find out where he heard these “slanders”. Alicent, however, claims that this insult is nothing compared to what Rhaenyra’s sons inflicted upon her own. She then asks where Laenor is, snidely remarking that he must be “entertaining” his squires. When Viserys asks Aemond, once again, where he heard the rumours, Aemond momentarily looks at Alicent, who appears worried, before saying it was Aegon who told him. Aegon claims that everyone knows the truth of the boys’ parentage, but Viserys merely demands that the family stop fighting, much to the disgust of Alicent, who demands retribution for her son’s lost eye. She orders Ser Criston to cut out Luke’s eye, but the knight refuses, as he is only sworn to her as her protector – not her assassin. Viserys announces that anyone who questions the birth of Rhaenyra’s sons will have their tongue removed, looking directly at Alicent as he does so.[9]
Shaking with rage and grief, Alicent grabs the Valyrian Steel dagger from Viserys’s belt, and moves to take Luke’s eye herself, but is stopped by Rhaenyra, who claims she has gone too far now. Alicent unleashes all of the feelings she has bottled up for years: She has only ever done what was expected of her, upholding the law, her family, and the kingdom, while Rhaenyra was always free to do as she pleases. Now that Rhaenyra’s son can even maim Alicent’s son without consequence, this is the last straw for Alicent. She shouts that Rhaenyra has no sense of duty or sacrifice, even as Viserys and Otto demand she put down the blade. Rhaenyra coldly responds that Alicent has been “hiding beneath the veil of her own righteousness”, but now she’s showing herself for what she truly is. In an attempt to break free of Rhaenyra’s grip, Alicent ends up slashing the princess’s left arm. At this, even Alicent becomes horrified at how out of control the situation has become, and comes to her senses, dropping the dagger. Aemond tells his mother not to mourn him: “I may have lost an eye, but I gained a dragon.”[9]
After everyone returns to their chambers, Alicent is visited by her father. She is humiliated and ashamed by her attempted attack on Rhaenyra and her son, which now guarantees Viserys will always side with Rhaenyra over her. She fears for her reputation as well, as word must already be spreading that she has gone mad with grief. To her surprise, however, Otto expresses pride: This is the first time he’s seen that side of her, and now he knows she has the determination to win the game of thrones. Alicent is still worried about what Viserys will say to her, but Otto assures her that if she humbles herself to him, and cites her grief as a mother for inflaming her passions, he will forgive her, as he cannot bring himself to do anything else. Otto then says that what Aemond did in winning Vhagar over to their side is worth him losing his eye a thousand times over. Alicent is visibly bothered by this statement.[9]
The next day, Alicent, Viserys, and their entourage depart Driftmark. In their carriage, Alicent, following her father’s advice, apologizes for her actions, but the ailing Viserys merely says that they will speak no more of it.[9]
On the ship, heading back to King’s Landing, Alicent is approached by Larys Strong, who calls what happened to Aemond “a perversion of justice”. He offers that if she still seeks revenge for Aemond's eye, he can easily arrange an assassination through his spy network. She declines, but says that his help has not gone unnoticed and she will have need of it in the future. Now, however, is the time for patience and discretion.[9]
Six years later, during which Alicent has had the entire Red Keep decorated with iconography of the Faith of the Seven, she attends a Small Council meeting, which is interrupted by Ser Harrold Westerling, announcing the arrival of Princess Rhaenyra and Prince Daemon. The council discuss the matter of the inheritance of Driftmark, in light of Corlys Velaryon’s recent, possibly fatal, injury, but Alicent merely says that they will hear petitions tomorrow, and takes her leave.[10]
As she goes to greet Rhaenyra and Daemon, Alicent is intercepted by Ser Erryk Cargyll of the Kingsguard (initially mistaking for his twin, Ser Arryk), who informs her of a delicate situation with Prince Aegon in his apartments.[10]
In her apartments, Alicent has a weeping serving girl, Dyana, brought before her. Dyana tearfully tells her that Aegon drunkenly forced himself upon her as she was serving him wine. Alicent is sympathetic to the girl, hugging her, and saying she believes her, but buys Dyana's silence with a pouch of gold and makes her drink Moon tea.[10]
Afterwards, Alicent furiously confronts a hungover Aegon, berating him for his assault on Dyanna – only the latest of many – and bringing shame on her and his wife with his conduct. She slaps him and declares him “no son of mine”. Aegon feebly protests at the weight of expectations placed upon him and the fact nothing he does ever satisfies his parents, but Alicent is unsympathetic. When Helaena, unaware of what has happened, enters the room and asks if anyone has seen Dyana, Alicent tearfully embraces her daughter.[10]
Alicent goes to greet Rhaenyra and Daemon in the king’s chambers, noticing remaining traces of the scar she made on Rhaenyra’s left forearm. The couple outright accuse Alicent and Otto of keeping Viserys stupefied on milk of the poppy so that they can rule in his name without interference, but she tells them that without it, he is blind with suffering. Daemon sarcastically asks whether the replacement of Targaryen heraldry with statues and stars was also part of the Maesters’ prescription, to which Alicent piously retorts such devotional displays are meant only to guide people and remind them of a higher authority. When Rhaenyra questions which authority will decide on her son's right to his own inheritance, Alicent smugly replies that will be her, and her father in his capacity as Hand of the King.[10]
Alicent and her father have a private meeting with Vaemond Velaryon, who has just arrived in the capital. Vaemond pledges the support of the Velaryon fleet if Alicent supports him as heir to Driftmark. Alicent is uneasy, pointing out that Lord Corlys may yet live.[10]
The next day, Alicent and the rest of the court gather in the throne room, as Otto presides over the succession of Driftmark in the event of Lord Corlys's death. As Vaemond makes his case, he is interrupted by Rhaenyra, accusing him of only serving his own ambition and undermining the right of Corlys’s chosen successor, Lucerys Velaryon. Alicent silences her, reminding her that she will have a chance to make her own case later. As Vaemond finishes, Rhaenyra prepares to make her case, but the ceremony is suddenly interrupted as the doors to the throne room open and, to everyone’s utter incredulity, King Viserys himself enters. Lost for words, Alicent can only exchange shocked looks with her father and Vaemond as Viserys hobbles up to the Iron Throne.[10]
Viserys declares his confusion as to why a settled succession is being debated, and asks Princess Rhaenys to speak – As Lord Corlys’s wife, she is the only one who could give keener insight into his wishes. Alicent listens in dismay as Rhaenys affirms her support of Lucerys as heir to Driftmark and announces that she has accepted a proposal from Rhaenyra to marry her granddaughters Baela and Rhaena to Rhaenyra’s sons Jacaerys and Lucerys. Viserys declares the matter settled, reaffirming Lucerys as heir to Driftmark and the next Lord of the Tides. An outraged Vaemond furiously snaps that Viserys has no authority to decide House Velaryon's fate when he broke centuries of tradition and Westerosi law to install his daughter as heir. He shouts that Rhaenyra’s children are bastards and she herself, a whore. At this, Daemon, before Viserys can respond, cuts off the upper half of Vaemond’s head with Dark Sister. Alicent and her daughter Helaena swiftly look away.[10]
As Viserys collapses from the shock and exertion, Alicent runs to him and helps lift him to his feet, insisting that he take something for the pain, but he refuses, saying he must make things right. Alicent and Rhaenyra watch in concern as Viserys is carried from the throne room.[10]
That evening, the entire royal family gathers for supper, including Alicent, Rhaenyra, Viserys, Daemon, all of their children, and Otto. They sit in awkward silence, though Viserys expresses his joy at seeing all his loved ones gathered together around him. Alicent makes a prayer to the Mother and the Smith for love and reconciliation, and for Vaemond to be given rest. She then listens tearfully as Viserys expresses his sorrow that their family has grown so distant and, after removing his mask and exposing his disfigured face for all to see, begs them all to make amends for his sake. After he sits down, Rhaenyra makes a toast to Alicent, thanking her for taking care of her father all these years. Moved, Alicent toasts Rhaenyra in turn, admitting that they have more in common than they may admit, as they are both mothers who love their children. She tells her she will make a fine queen. Tensions cease for a time, as Jace toasts Aegon and Aemond, and Helaena toasts Baela and Rhaena. Alicent laughs with her father as they watch Jace and Helaena dance, and smiles at Viserys.[10]
Seeing Viserys start to succumb to pain, Alicent has the guards carry him to his bed. After he is gone, Aemond, provoked by Luke’s snickering at a roast pig that had been placed in front of him, makes a tribute to Jace, Luke, and Joffrey, calling them “Strong boys”. Alicent tries to talk Aemond down, but it’s no good, and Rhaenyra’s sons get in a fight with Alicent’s over the gilded insult. As the guards pull the children apart, Alicent angrily scolds Aemond for provoking Jace & Luke, but Aemond, completely unabashed, insists he was only complimenting them. The boys are ordered to their quarters, and Alicent, hoping to make amends with Rhaenyra, asks her to stay longer. Rhaenyra agrees to return on dragonback after seeing her sons home, which Alicent says she and Viserys would both like.[10]
That night, Alicent goes to Viserys’s chamber and gives him milk of the poppy to help him sleep. Viserys deliriously talks about Aegon’s dream and the Prince That Was Promised who will unite the realm against the cold and the dark. “It is you”, he says. “You must do this.” Alicent, taking this to mean that her son Aegon must sit the Iron Throne, tells Viserys she understands as she walks out of the room.[10]
Later that night, Alicent is woken by her handmaiden Talya, who informs her that Viserys has died in his sleep. A visibly distraught Alicent orders her to tell no one, dresses hastily, and goes to see her father in the Tower of the Hand. After delivering the news to Otto, she tells him that with his last breath, Viserys told her that he wanted Aegon to sit the Iron Throne.[11]
Alicent and Otto hastily convene the Small Council, where they announce the king’s death, as well as his supposed final wish. To Alicent’s surprise, her father and Ser Tyland Lannister immediately begin discussing their “long-laid plans” to do away with all obstacles to Aegon’s rule. Appalled, she demands to know why she was not informed that members of the council were plotting to install her son as heir without her knowledge, to which Lord Jasper Wylde replies they did not want to sully her with their schemes. Lord Lyman Beesbury is likewise indignant, expressing his disbelief that the king changed his mind, as Alicent – Aegon’s mother – is the only witness, and accusing them all of theft and treason. To the horror of all present, Ser Criston angrily forces Lord Beesbury to sit down, and in doing so, fatally cracks his skull on the table. When Ser Harrold furiously orders Ser Criston to surrender his white cloak, Criston instead draws on him, justifying his actions as defending the queen’s honor. Alicent, however, orders Ser Criston to stand down, as Otto does the same for Ser Harrold.[11]
As Otto and Tyland begin discussing dividing the gold within the royal treasury, a stressed and exhausted Alicent asks what is to be done about Rhaenyra. Otto replies that they cannot allow her to rally support for her claim, but that she and her family will be given the chance to publicly swear fealty to the new king. Knowing that Otto and the rest of the council are well aware that neither Rhaenyra nor Daemon will agree to do so, Alicent realizes that they plan to have Rhaenyra killed. When they try to say that a living challenger would invite bloodshed, and that Viserys wouldn’t want any unsavory power squabbles, Alicent shouts that he would never have wanted his daughter murdered either, and when Lord Jasper starts to speak up, she furiously threatens him with exile to the Night's Watch. However, when Tyland asks her for an alternative plan, she is unable to offer one. Otto orders Ser Harrold to take his knights to Dragonstone, to kill Rhaenyra and Daemon, but Ser Harrold instead resigns from the Kingsguard in disgust and walks out.[11]
To ensure that word of the king’s death will not get out until they want it to, Alicent and Otto have all residents of the Red Keep imprisoned or confined to their chamber.[11]
Alicent and Otto discover that Aegon has gone missing, and burst into Helaena’s chamber, demanding to know where he is. She disinterestedly tells them she doesn’t know, however. Otto leaves, and Helaena's nurse leads her children Jaehaerys and Jaehaera out of the room. Alicent sits down next to her daughter and tries to tell her that her father is dead, but Helaena only cryptically and urgently tells her that "there is a beast beneath the boards".[11]
Later, Alicent is visited by Ser Criston, who tells her that Aegon is nowhere in the castle, and that her father has sent Ser Erryk Cargyle into the city to find him. Knowing that if Aegon is brought to him, Otto would be able to exert his influence over him, Alicent orders Ser Criston to track him down and bring him to her instead. Aemond volunteers to accompany Ser Criston, pointing out that he knows his brother, and thus the search would go more easily with his help. Reluctantly, Alicent agrees.[11]
After the Silent Sisters cover up Viserys’s body, Alicent places his crown upon his chest and weeps over her dead husband.[11]
Alicent goes to visit Rhaenys Targaryen, who like everyone else, is confined to her chambers. Rhaenys immediately deduces that the king must be dead, and accuses Alicent of usurping the throne, to which she responds that it was her husband’s dying wish that Aegon take the throne, much to Rhaenys’s clear disbelief. Alicent asks Rhaenys for her support, pointing out that her family’s allegiance to Rhaenyra has resulted in both of her children dying, her husband being grievously wounded, and a bastard being set to inherit their seat. She tells her that, while she loved Viserys, Rhaenys should have been chosen as queen over him, and that as women, while they may not rule, they can at least guide the men who do towards a brighter future. Rhaenys demands to know what is to be done with her dragon, to which Alicent replies that they can’t release Meleys, as her help will only embolden Rhaenyra to strike at them, saying that a true queen counts the cost to her people. Rhaenys points out to Alicent that, for all her talk, she still toils in the service of men, whether it be her father, her husband, or her son, and that rather than be free, she merely wishes to carve a window in the wall of her prison. She asks Alicent if she truly never imagined herself on the Iron Throne, leaving her momentarily speechless. Alicent leaves Rhaenys, clearly rattled by her words.[11]
Aemond and Ser Criston bring Aegon to Alicent, having successfully tracked him down before Ser Erryk and his brother, and she goes to the Tower of the Hand to confront her father, who congratulates her on winning their little “game”, and insists that they both want what’s best for the family and that their hearts remain as one. Alicent retorts that their hearts were never one. She’s tired of being a pawn in her father’s machinations, and bitterly says that she’ll never know what her life might have been like now, thanks to him. When he insists that sacrifices must be made for the good of the realm, she shouts back that not wanting to murder people is not a weakness. As she now has Aegon, Alicent decides what is to be done: Terms of peace will be sent to Rhaenyra, as Viserys would have wanted mercy to be shown to her. Otto questions whether it is truly Viserys’s wishes she is honoring, or her own, as Rhaenyra’s childhood friend. Having no answer, Alicent merely presses on, saying that Ser Criston will be named Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, and that Aegon will be anointed at dawn the next day, in front of the whole of King’s Landing. Otto remarks on how much Alicent looks like her mother, to which she scoffs and leaves.[11]
Returning to her chambers, Alicent finds Larys Strong, who tells her he has learnt something she should know. Knowing what he wants in return for his information, Alicent resignedly exposes her feet, to which he pleasures himself while telling her of a spy network her father has been using to gather information. One of these spies, he informs her, is her lady-in-waiting, Talya. Larys offers to dispose of the head of this spy network, to which Alicent agrees, and looks away in disgust as he continues to pleasure himself to her feet.[11]
The next morning, Alicent and Aegon ride in the royal carriage to the Dragonpit, where the coronation is to be held. Alicent demands her sullen son have the decency to look grateful, given what has been done to give him this day. He bitterly reminds her that his father never wanted him to be king, as he steadfastly upheld Rhaenyra’s claim, but she tells him Viserys changed his mind at the last moment, to which Aegon gives a disbelieving laugh. Alicent presents Aegon with Viserys’s Valyrian Steel dagger, and insists that he reject her father’s counsel that Rhaenyra be executed. Aegon suddenly asks her if she loves him, to which she amusedly and lovingly calls him an imbecile.[11]
As the entire city gathers in the dragonpit, Aegon’s coronation ceremony gets underway. Alicent kisses her son on the forehead, and watches as Septon Eustace blesses him in the name of the Seven, and Ser Criston crowns him with Aegon the Conqueror’s crown. Alicent smiles as Aegon is declared king, and the entire gathered crowd applauds.[11]
The celebration is cut short, however, as the floor of the Dragonpit bursts apart and Rhaenys emerges on the back of her dragon Meleys. As the crowd flees the pit, Alicent orders Ser Criston to take Helaena to safety, as she places herself between Aegon and the snarling dragon. Accepting her fate, Alicent closes her eyes and waits for Meleys’s flames to engulf her, but Meleys merely roars. Alicent opens her eyes and looks up at Rhaenys, who gives her a cold look, signaling her rejection of Alicent's request for her support, before turning Meleys around and flying out of the wrecked Dragonpit. Alicent looks down in relief of having been spared, as well as fear of how Rhaenyra will react when she learns of her father's death and the usurpation of her throne.[11]
When Otto is sent to Dragonstone to offer the Blacks terms of surrender, Alicent asks him to give Rhaenyra the page she tore from Ten Thousand Ships, in hopes of persuading her old friend to do what is best for everyone by reminding her of their past friendship.[12]
Personality
Alicent is fiercely loyal to her family.[1] She has a habit of picking at her fingernails when she is stressed since her youth.[3]
Since she was still a kid, Alicent was already very studious, with a particular passion for history, and devoted to pursuing her duties and meeting the expectations that everyone, her father in the first place, had of her. She was also unconditionally loyal to Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen, her best friend, to whom she felt deeply attached.
Having lost her mother at a very young age, Alicent is able to fully understand the stages of mourning that both Viserys and Rhaenyra are going through after Queen Aemma's death and this has helped her in knowing how to advise and give emotional support to both of them.

Behind the scenes
Alicent Hightower was revealed to be a lead character in House of the Dragon on July 18, 2020. On December 11, 2020, HBO announced that Olivia Cooke had signed on for the series. The character breakdown reads as follows:
- "She's the daughter of Otto Hightower, the Hand of the King, and the most comely woman in the Seven Kingdoms. She was raised in the Red Keep, close to the king and his innermost circle; she possesses both a courtly grace and a keen political acumen."
- ―HBO
On July 6, 2021, it was reported that Emily Carey was set to portray young Alicent.
In the books
Alicent's father Otto Hightower had been Hand of the King in the last few years of the long reign of King Jaehaerys I Targaryen. In 101 AC Otto brought the 15 year old Alicent to the royal court, where she cared for the aging king (who was left a broken shell after the recent death of his queen of many years, Alysanne, and then his second son Baelon a year later). Jaehaerys died in 103 AC and was succeeded by his grandson Viserys I, who ruled for 26 years. Her father Otto remained as Hand of the King for Viserys I, and Otto's older brother in time succeeded as head of House Hightower.
Alicent is described as looking quite young for her age, even well into her 40s. Despite having four pregnancies, Alicent maintained her youthful figure. In her youth, Alicent was said to be one of the most comely maidens in Westeros, but also precociously clever.
Alicent's father Otto wasn't the head of House Hightower, but the younger brother of the unnamed head of the family - by the time of the Dance, Otto's nephew Ormund was the ruler of House Hightower and Oldtown. Alicent's mother was never mentioned in the books at all, to the point that her absence from scenes at the royal court may imply that she died years before the Dance of the Dragons. Alicent had an unspecified number of siblings, but the only one ever identified was her youngest brother Gwayne. She also had numerous cousins.

Notes
- ↑ Viserys states that Rhaenyra is 15 years old in "The Rogue Prince," which takes place in 112 AC. "The Heirs of the Dragon" takes place earlier in 112 AC, and in that episode she is 14 according to Emily Carey. (interview with Insider, Popsugar, and Metacritic). She was therefore born in 97 AC, same as in the books. Alicent Hightower is the same age as Rhaenyra according to the interview previously linked.

King Viserys I Targaryen,[N 2] remembered as Viserys the Peaceful, was the fifth king of the Targaryen dynasty to rule the Seven Kingdoms.
Viserys I was the grandson of Jaehaerys I Targaryen, and father of Rhaenyra. He briefly rode Balerion the Black Dread in his youth before the dragon's death of old age.
Biography
Background
Viserys I is the grandson of King Jaehaerys I Targaryen. He immediately succeeded his grandfather as king because Jaehaerys I ruled for so long that his children, Prince Baelon and Princess Alyssa (Viserys's parents), predeceased him. Jaehaerys I was himself the grandson of Aegon the Conqueror, who invaded and united Westeros and forged the Iron Throne.[2]
Viserys inherited the realm after an unprecedented fifty years of peace and prosperity under his grandfather, a golden age that Viserys strives not to disrupt.[2] A full century after the Targaryen Conquest, their dynasty's rule is unchallenged - save for still-independent Dorne, though relations with them have also been calm and stable for decades.
All is not stable within House Targaryen, however, as Viserys's first cousin Rhaenys contested their grandfather's succession. Rhaenys was the only child of Jaehaerys's first son, while Viserys was the eldest son of Jaehaerys's second son, but the relatively young Targaryen dynasty did not have firmly established succession laws. Moreover, if Rhaenys was to be passed over due to being a woman, others (including House Stark) argued that rule should pass to her son Laenor Velaryon. To address the issue, all the lords of Westeros gathered in the Great Council of 101 AC: Viserys won the final vote by a wide margin, and Rhaenys grudgingly accepted the result. Nonetheless, this left a major rift between Viserys's new royal court and House Velaryon, led by Rhaenys's husband Corlys Velaryon, admiral of the royal fleets and the wealthiest man in Westeros.[2] King Jaehaerys died and was succeeded by Viserys in 103 AC.[N 3]
Adding to these tensions, at the beginning of his reign Viserys had yet to produce a male heir with his beloved wife, Queen Aemma Arryn - despite Viserys's claim to the throne being based on direct succession from male to male. Their only living child is Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen, but according to the precedent set by the council at Harrenhal, Viserys's heir should be his closest male relative - his younger brother Daemon Targaryen. Yet the lords of Westeros and even Viserys himself consider Daemon too wild and hot-headed to ever be a suitable heir to the throne.[2]
The question of Viserys's succession leads to factions forming in the realm as ambitious lords compete for his favor, particularly the Velaryons trying to regain the throne they see as rightfully theirs, and House Hightower - the powerful family of Viserys's Hand of the King, Otto Hightower, the rulers of Oldtown who maintain deep ties with the leadership of the Faith of the Seven.[3]
House of the Dragon: Season 1
Nine years into his reign, he attends a meeting of the Small Council. Lord Corlys Velaryon brings to the council's attention that the alliance in the Free Cities known as the "Triarchy" is trying to claim the Stepstones for themselves, warning that Westerosi ports could be badly affected, but Viserys dismisses his concerns. Master of Coin Lyman Beesbury brings up that, at the request of Prince Daemon, the crown has invested significant money in the re-training and re-equipping of the City Watch, and he urges Viserys to make the prince fill his seat on the table to inform the council on his progress as commander. Viserys assures him that his gold is well-invested. Otto Hightower brings up the subject of the Heir's Tournament, which Viserys has planned for the approaching birth of his next child and hopeful son. Grand Maester Mellos reminds Viserys that they cannot be certain that the child will be a boy, but Viserys expresses his confidence that it will be.[2]
Viserys undergoes treatment from his maesters for an infected wound he suffered from sitting on the Iron Throne. He accepts the advice of Maester Mickon to have the wound cauterized. Viserys goes to see his wife Aemma, who is taking a bath. Viserys expresses his confidence to her that the child will be a boy, telling her of a dragon dream he had of their son being born wearing Aegon the Conqueror's crown, amidst the sound of thundering hooves, splintering shields, and ringing swords, and all the dragons roaring as one as Viserys placed his son upon the Iron Throne. Aemma insists that boy or girl, it will be their last; after several miscarriages and stillbirths, and one child dead in the cradle (a total of five within ten years), she cannot bring herself to mourn another child.[2]
The Small Council is convened to discuss the excessive violence employed by Daemon and the City Watch. Otto Hightower insists that Daemon's actions can no longer go unchecked, but Daemon defends his actions, stating that he was simply making the city safe for the guests arriving for the Heir's Tournament. Viserys agrees with Daemon, but questions his overly violent methods. Daemon and Otto get into an argument about Daemon's wife, Lady Rhea Royce, much to Viserys's exasperation. When Otto rises to Daemon's bait of mentioning his own dead wife, Viserys reminds Otto that Daemon loves to provoke him, and that he should not indulge him. Viserys gives Daemon permission to continue enforcing his laws, but warns him not to put on another performance like the previous night's. After Daemon leaves, Viserys comments that Daemon's new City Watch might be a good thing, as the city has been in decline since the death of his grandmother, Alysanne Targaryen.[2]
The following day, Viserys commences the Heir's Tournament, greeting his guests, praising the competing knights, and announcing that Queen Aemma has begun her labors. After Lord Boremund Baratheon asks Princess Rhaenys for her favor, calling her "The Queen Who Never Was," Otto tells Viserys he could have Lord Boremund's tongue out for that. Viserys decides to let it slide, though he does applaud happily when Boremund is knocked off his horse by Ser Criston Cole. After Daemon defeats Otto's son, Ser Gwayne Hightower, Viserys receives news of Aemma's labor, and rushes to her side. To his horror, Grand Maester Mellos explains that the child is in breech, and that they must either cut open her womb to free the baby, a procedure that will almost certainly kill her, or risk losing both. Despite being appalled by the necessity of such a choice, Viserys grudgingly gives his consent for the maesters to cut into Aemma's womb. As the maesters remove the newborn baby, Viserys weeps over his dead wife's body. Mellos informs him that the baby is a boy, and Viserys says that he is to be given the name Baelon (in honor of his father, Baelon the Brave). However, at that moment, the infant prince begins choking in the Grand Maester's arms, and passes away a few hours later.[2]
Some time later, a funeral is held outside King's Landing, for Queen Aemma and Prince Baelon. Viserys is nearly frozen with grief and shock, and can only watch tearfully as Rhaenyra orders her dragon Syrax to light his wife and son's pyre.[2]
That night, the Small Council convenes, as Otto Hightower insists that they need to discuss the succession now that Aemma and Baelon are dead, though Viserys is in too much grief to want to discuss this. Otto and Mellos argue that it would destabilize the realm for Daemon to become king. Mellos even implies that Daemon may try to kill Viserys to take the throne, a claim Viserys angrily rejects. He reminds Otto that it was his own idea to put Daemon in command of the City Watch, after arguing against every other appointment Viserys tried to make for him. Despite Otto's arguments, Viserys refuses to exile his brother from King's Landing. Otto and Mellos suggest Viserys name Rhaenyra his heir, but Viserys refuses to choose between his brother and daughter. When the council begin to argue, Viserys furiously berates them all for behaving like crows squabbling over a corpse while he is still mourning his wife and son, and storms out.[2]
Later, while a disconsolate Viserys works on a large model of Old Valyria, he is visited by Otto's daughter, Alicent Hightower. She brings him a history book to distract him, knowing his love for the subject, and offers her condolences for his loss, relating her experience of losing her mother, which Viserys appreciates.[2]
At a Small Council meeting, Viserys is informed by Otto that Daemon bought a pleasure house on the Street of Silk, where he made a speech toasting Prince Baelon, and styling him "The Heir for a Day." Enraged, Viserys summons Daemon to the Great Hall, where he confronts him over the insult. When Daemon doesn't deny saying it, Viserys accuses him of celebrating his own rise, rather than comforting his grieving brother and niece. He reminds Daemon that he has always defended him from the rest of the Small Council, to which Daemon retorts that he should have named Daemon his Hand, as he is his brother. He tells Viserys that he needs him by his side, as he is weak, and needs protection from the Small Council, who all use him for their own ends (Otto Hightower in particular.) At this, Viserys declares his intention to name a new heir. When Daemon insists he is his brother's heir, Viserys retorts "Not anymore" and orders him to return to his wife at Runestone. After Daemon leaves, Viserys accidentally cuts his finger on the Iron Throne.[2]
Later that evening, Viserys summons Rhaenyra to Balerion's shrine, and asks her what she sees when she looks at the dragons. She says she sees their family, and that the belief that Targaryens are more god than man is only because of their dragons. Satisfied with her answer, Viserys warns Rhaenyra that the dragons are a dangerous power that should never have been trifled with, one that caused the Doom of Valyria, and could destroy their family too if they are not careful. He announces his intention to name her as his heir, apologizing to her for wasting the years since her birth wanting for a son. He tells her that he believes she could be a great queen, and that he knows her mother did too, but warns her that the Iron Throne is the most dangerous seat in the realm. To cement his trust in her, Viserys tells Rhaenyra a secret known only by the king and his heir: Aegon the Conqueror was not solely motivated by ambition and lust for power to conquer Westeros. Just as Daenys Targaryen foresaw the Doom of Valyria, Aegon had a vision that foretold the end of the world of men. Aegon foresaw the end would be preceded by a terrible winter descending from the north, and that what lurked within that storm would destroy the world of the living, unless the kingdoms of men united against it with a Targaryen to lead them. Since Aegon's time, the Targaryen kings have passed knowledge of Aegon's vision, which he dubbed "The Song of Ice and Fire," to their heirs, to ensure Westeros was ready when the evil Aegon foresaw finally descended upon mankind.[2]
The nobility of the realm is gathered, and Viserys watches as each lord declares fealty to him and Rhaenyra as his named heir. He then stands and officially names Rhaenyra Princess of Dragonstone and heir to the Iron Throne.[2]
Half a year later, a Small Council meeting is held to discuss the death of Lord Commander Ryam Redwyne. Mellos assures Viserys that he died peacefully in his sleep. As the council discusses finding Ser Ryam's replacement on the Kingsguard, Corlys Velaryon interrupts the meeting to demand something be done about the Crabfeeder, whose forces have now destroyed four of his ships. Viserys refuses to start a war with the Free Cities, who he says are undoubtedly supplying the Crabfeeder's armies. Lord Corlys points out that Viserys's inaction has allowed Daemon to take Dragonstone, to which Viserys responds that he has acted by sending envoys to Pentos and Volantis in hopes of finding common cause. Rhaenyra speaks up, suggesting Viserys send his dragonriders to the Stepstones as a show of force, embarrassing Viserys, who, at the suggestion of Otto Hightower, has Lord Commander Harrold Westerling take Rhaenyra to help choose Ser Ryam's replacement on the Kingsguard, seeing as this knight will help protect her as well.[4]
Some time later, Viserys shows Alicent his model of Old Valyria, telling her about their city, culture, and magic. When she asks if he believes Westeros could be a new Valyria, he responds that nothing will ever match the glory of Valyria at its height. Viserys accidentally drops and breaks a model dragon, which Alicent picks up and hands back to him, as they share a quietly intimate moment. Viserys asks after Rhaenyra's wellbeing, since she hasn't spoken more than a few words to him recently. Alicent tells him it will take time for Rhaenyra to open up again, remembering how it took time for her after her own mother's death. She suggests Viserys approach Rhaenyra instead, to which he quips that he would rather face the Black Dread. Viserys asks Alicent not to mention their talks to Rhaenyra, as he is worried that she might not understand them.[4]
Later that afternoon, in the gardens of the Red Keep, Viserys meets with Lord Corlys and Princess Rhaenys, in hopes of patching things up after their disagreements at the Small Council. After they exchange apologies, Viserys reminds Corlys that as king, it is his duty to avoid war until it becomes unavoidable. Corlys points out how precarious Viserys's reign currently looks: his wife has passed, a girl has been named heir, his disinherited brother has been allowed to seize Dragonstone, and a foreign power has established a foothold in one of their most critical shipping lanes. He urges Viserys to strengthen his image in two ways: firstly by taking back the Stepstones, and secondly by wedding his daughter Laena, thus uniting the Targaryen dragons and the Velaryon fleet by blood. Taken aback by the proposal, Viserys admits he hadn't given much thought to marriage after Aemma's death, but Rhaenys reminds him that it will be expected of him to take a new wife so as to produce more heirs and strengthen his line.[4]
That night, Viserys and Rhaenyra eat dinner together. They briefly talk about their shared love for Aemma, but Viserys is still preoccupied thinking about Corlys's proposal, and is reluctant to speak of it to Rhaenyra. Rhaenyra tells Viserys that of all the knights that were gathered to replace Ser Ryam on the Kingsguard, only Ser Criston Cole had real combat experience, and he expresses his confidence that Ser Criston will make a fine knight of the Kingsguard. She tries to apologize for speaking out at the Small Council earlier, but he dismisses it, stating that she is young, and will learn propriety in time.[4]
Afterwards, Viserys goes to Mellos for treatment of his gangrenous finger, and Mellos provides maggots to remove the dead flesh and stop the advance of the rot. Viserys informs Mellos and Otto Hightower of Lord Corlys's proposal that he marry Laena, to which Otto claims that Corlys has overreached by going over the heads of the Small Council. He expresses his doubts about the union due to Laena's young age, but Mellos advises Viserys to accept, on the basis that it would help mend the rift between their houses suffered at the Great Council of 101. Viserys is still hesitant, due to his doubts that Rhaenyra would approve (and secretly, his burgeoning feelings for Alicent), but Mellos reminds him that it is his duty to remarry and continue to propagate the royal line. Otto expresses sympathy to Viserys over his position of having to replace his beloved wife for the sake of duty.[4]
The next day, Viserys walks through the gardens with the twelve-year-old Laena Velaryon. Laena, however, seems more interested in dragons than marriage, asking Viserys about his experience riding Balerion, and the potential whereabouts of Vhagar. She does eventually promise Viserys that she will give him many pure-blooded Valyrian children if he were to marry her, but Viserys can tell that she is merely repeating the words her father told her to say, and asks her what her mother told her. She replies that her mother told her she wouldn't have to bed Viserys until she turned fourteen, making him visibly uncomfortable.[4]
Later that evening, Viserys dines privately in Alicent's company, where she commiserates with him over his reluctance at wedding a new queen. She reveals that she had the stonemasons fix the dragon model he broke. Touched, Viserys thanks her for the gift. Their conversation is interrupted by the arrival of Alicent's father, who informs Viserys that he has called an emergency meeting of the Small Council.[4]
The Small Council is informed by a Dragonkeeper Elder that Daemon has stolen a dragon egg. Mellos reads out a letter, declaring Daemon's intention to take a second wife, Mysaria, and to place the stolen egg in the cradle of his unborn child by Mysaria, in the tradition of House Targaryen. The letter also invites Viserys to Daemon's wedding in two days' time. Knowing that Daemon is trying to provoke him, Viserys initially refuses to take action, but when Rhaenyra asks the Dragonkeeper which egg was stolen, he reveals that it was the same egg she chose for Prince Baelon's cradle. Enraged, Viserys announces his intention to lead a detachment to Dragonstone and drag Daemon back to face justice, but Otto advises against it, as it would be too dangerous, and says he'll go himself. Viserys relents.[4]
After Otto and his men leave, Viserys holds a private audience with Master of Laws Lyonel Strong, wanting an impartial opinion about a prospective marriage to Laena Velaryon. He expresses his discomfort at marrying a twelve-year-old, but Lord Lyonel states that he should marry her, pointing out that strengthening an alliance with House Velaryon could temper Corlys's bitterness over the Great Council's decision, unify the last descendants of Valyria, and ensure the Crown has access to the Velaryon fleet should the situation in the Stepstones deteriorate into open war. The meeting is interrupted by Ser Steffon Darklyn of the Kingsguard, announcing that Rhaenyra has returned from Dragonstone, much to Viserys's shock and confusion.[4]
Viserys has Rhaenyra brought to his chambers, where he angrily chides her for going to Dragonstone without the crown's leave, and putting herself in danger, reminding her that she is his only heir. He is calmed, however, when Rhaenyra points out that she retrieved the stolen egg without bloodshed. They speak about Aemma for a time, bonding over their shared grief, and Viserys notes that Rhaenyra has inherited a lot from her. They then reluctantly broach the topic of a prospective remarriage. Viserys emphasizes that he could never replace Aemma, but with only Rhaenyra as his heir, were anything to happen to her, House Targaryen could come to an end, and though Viserys insists he will not replace Rhaenyra as his heir, even if his new wife were to give him sons, he must ensure the continuation of their line. Rhaenyra assures him that she understands that as king, Viserys's first duty is to the realm, and that Aemma would have understood as well.[4]
Viserys calls a Small Council meeting the next morning, where he announces, to everyone's shock, that he intends to marry Alicent Hightower. Lord Corlys, enraged by this perceived insult to his family, protests the decision, to which Viserys reminds him that he is his king, causing Corlys to storm out. To Viserys's surprise, a shocked and hurt Rhaenyra shortly follows him.[4]
A year after his marriage to Alicent, she gives him a son, who they name Aegon. On Aegon's second nameday, Viserys organizes a royal hunt in the Kingswood, excited to leave the politics of court behind. As the party prepares for departure, his new Master of Ships, Ser Tyland Lannister, counsels him to send aid to Prince Daemon and Lord Corlys in their efforts to retake the Stepstones from the Crabfeeder. Viserys, however, is preoccupied by the absence of his daughter, and demands to know where Rhaenyra is.[5]
As the hunting party departs, Viserys rides in the royal carriage with his pregnant queen Alicent and his children Rhaenyra and Aegon. Viserys is excited about the prospect of their entire family riding off to a hunt together, but Rhaenyra, still angry at both him and Alicent, responds coldly. She has no desire to join them in the hunt, though he reminds her that she has duties as the Princess.[5]
Upon arriving in the Kingswood, Viserys emerges from the carriage, followed by Alicent and their baby Aegon, who several of the gathered lords and ladies, most notably, Lord Hobert Hightower, applaud and hail as the "second of his name."[5]
After she is proposed to by Jason Lannister, Rhaenyra furiously confronts Viserys, accusing him of trying to marry her off to the great houses like a prize. Viserys reminds her that she is of age, and that he has tried to talk with her about the countless proposals he has received for her hand, but she has refused to discuss it. When Rhaenyra claims that she has no desire to marry, Viserys shouts that even he isn't above tradition and duty, causing the whole crowd gathered in the tent to look in their direction. Their argument is interrupted by Otto Hightower, informing Viserys that a white hart has been spotted, a regal portent for Aegon's nameday, he claims. Viserys then notices that Rhaenyra has left.[5]
Viserys is informed by the Royal Huntsman, Ser Howland Sharp, that the white hart's fresh droppings were found half a league to the east, and that they now have its trail. Sharp reminds Viserys that the white hart was the symbol of royalty in Westeros before the dragons came, to which Otto once again comments on the significance of such a creature appearing on Prince Aegon's nameday.[5]
That night, Viserys, doubtful and conflicted over his choice of heir, drinks several cups of wine. He is approached by Jason Lannister, with a gift of a spear he had forged in the Golden Gallery of Casterly Rock in honor of Prince Aegon, in hopes that it might provide the killing stroke against the white hart. Viserys thanks him for the gift, but becomes annoyed when Jason asks for Rhaenyra's hand. Jason tells Viserys that he and many other lords had assumed that he would name Aegon as his heir, to which Viserys reminds him that he did not name Rhaenyra his heir on a whim. Viserys is then approached by Otto, who informs him that it won't be long until the white hart is cornered, and asks what he thinks of Jason's proposal, to which Viserys remarks "That man's pride has pride." When Otto reminds him that Rhaenyra will do as he commands, Viserys replies that he has no desire to command his own daughter, but simply wants her to be happy. Otto then suggests he marry Rhaenyra to her brother, Prince Aegon, but Viserys refuses, as Aegon is only two years old. As Otto continues to press the matter, Viserys laughs in exasperation, as had come to hunt, but instead he is still being suffocated by politics. Otto leaves, and Viserys continues to drown himself in wine. He is approached by Lord Lyonel Strong, who informs him that they have sent out riders to find Rhaenyra, and that Ser Criston also went with her. Viserys, now quite drunk, vents his frustration at not being able to control his own daughter, to which Lyonel reminds him that even King Jaehaerys had trouble controlling his children, especially his daughters. Lyonel offers his advice on the matter of finding a match for Rhaenyra, and Viserys assumes that he will propose his own son, Ser Harwin Strong as her match. To his surprise, however, Lyonel does no such thing, instead suggesting she be married to Laenor Velaryon, the son of Lord Corlys, as he has Valyrian blood, and their union could help sate Corlys and mend the widened rift between their houses. Viserys leaves the tent, giving Lyonel a grateful pat on the shoulder.[5]
Viserys continues drinking in front of a pyre, where he is joined by Alicent. He spills out his feelings to her, telling her about his dragon dream of placing his son upon the Iron Throne, and expressing his tremendous guilt over causing his wife's death in pursuit of that dream. He says he named Rhaenyra his heir as a means of setting things right, as he never imagined he would remarry and have a son. He wonders if he was wrong to name Rhaenyra his heir.[5]
The next morning, the hunting party has successfully captured a stag, but to Viserys's relief, it is not a white one, and therefore not a sign that he chose wrong. Using Jason Lannister's spear, Viserys kills the restrained animal, with great difficulty and reluctance, having to spear it again after botching his first attempt. The party applauds him afterwards.[5]
Later, Viserys and the rest of the party watch in some surprise as Rhaenyra returns to the camp with a boar that she and Ser Criston Cole killed.[5]
The night after the hunting party returns to King's Landing, Viserys, now hungover from all the drinking, is visited by Alicent in his chambers. They discuss the matter of Rhaenyra's betrothal, with Alicent telling Viserys that she will not marry unless she thinks it's by her own choice. Alicent discovers a letter Viserys was sent by Vaemond Velaryon, the brother of Lord Corlys, informing him that the fighting in the Stepstones is going poorly, and pleading for aid. Viserys is reluctant to send it, as to do so after so long would make him look weak, and remarks that he is forever doomed to anger one person in the pleasing of another. Alicent simplifies the problem for him: as king, Viserys must serve the realm, and the realm will only benefit if the Crabfeeder is vanquished. This sufficiently sways Viserys.[5]
The next morning, Viserys summons Rhaenyra to the Small Council chamber, as he sends Ser Addam to the Stepstones with a letter promising to send ten ships and two thousand men to their aid. Rhaenyra accuses Viserys of wanting to replace her with Aegon, the boy he always wanted, but Viserys assures her that he has no intention of doing so, and only wants to see her happy. He reminds her that she has always understood the necessity of rulers marrying for advantage, to which Rhaenyra retorts that if it was truly for advantage, he would have married Laena Velaryon, a point Viserys concedes. He tells her that she must marry and produce offspring to strengthen her own claim, but allows her to choose her own match, as he did. As Rhaenyra begins to leave, Viserys assures her that, while he did waver at one time, she will not be supplanted as heir, swearing this on the memory of her mother.[5]
Alicent later gives Viserys a daughter, who they name Helaena.[6]
Some time later, a crowd assembles before the Iron Throne as Viserys puts on his full regalia to welcome back his brother Daemon after his victory in the Stepstones. He is shocked and annoyed to see Rhaenyra there, as she is supposed to be on a tour to find a husband, which he worked hard to arrange. Daemon enters the room, carrying his sword Dark Sister and the Crabfeeder's hammer, and also wearing a crown made of bone and driftwood. Viserys comments on the crown, and Daemon tells him that he was named King of the Narrow Sea after defeating the Triarchy. However, he says he knows that there is only one true king, and kneels to Viserys, giving him the crown and the Stepstones. Viserys asks where Lord Corlys is, and Daemon tells him that he sailed home to Driftmark. Daemon claims that he had two thousand dead Triarchy corsairs staked to the sand as a warning for anyone else who might challenge them. Coming down from the Throne, Viserys orders Daemon to rise, and embraces his brother. The entire court applauds their reconciliation.[6]
Viserys holds a feast in Daemon's honor in the Red Keep's godswood, where he shares happy stories with his brother, who he hasn't seen in years. He good-naturedly admits that Daemon was always their mother's favorite, as like him, she was a warrior and a rule-breaker who didn't care about customs or tradition. Alicent asks Daemon if he would like to see the new tapestries from Norvos and Qohor on display in the gallery, but Viserys laughs at this suggestion, as Daemon has no interest in such things. Rhaenyra says she would like to see them, and Viserys tersely excuses her.[6]
At a Small Council meeting, Tyland Lannister gives Viserys troubling news: now that the Velaryon fleet hold the Stepstones, Lord Corlys can control the vital shipping lanes going through it, giving him considerable leverage over the crown. Viserys can't believe Corlys is still upset about him spurning the marriage alliance with Laena after so many years, but as Mellos points out, Corlys is a proud man whose pride has been wounded. Otto Hightower reveals that the situation is worse than that: according to his brother in Oldtown, Lord Corlys plans to marry Laena to the son of the Sealord of Braavos. This potential alliance would necessitate the crown making a marriage pact of their own.[6]
That night, Viserys takes a bath. The infection he is suffering from wasn't stopped by amputating two of his fingers, only slowed, and the sores on his back are slightly worse than before. Alicent dismisses the handmaidens and bathes Viserys's sores herself, with him commenting that her touch feels far kinder than theirs. Later, Viserys summons Alicent to his chambers, and the two of them have sex, though Alicent receives no pleasure from it.[6]
Early the next morning, Viserys is woken by Otto Hightower, who delivers troubling news: Rhaenyra was spotted at a pleasure house the previous night. This in and of itself doesn't alarm Viserys, but Otto goes on to say that she was herself "coupling" at the brothel, not just looking, and with her own uncle Daemon. Viserys is incredulous and says that it must be a lie, demanding to know who is responsible for this gossip so he can take their eyes. He then redirects his anger at Otto, accusing him of being so ambitious that he would have his daughter stalked with spies to destroy her reputation. Otto tries to deny this, but Viserys refuses to believe it, ordering Otto out. After Otto leaves, Viserys turns to find Alicent, who overheard the conversation.[6]
Several hours later, Viserys has Daemon seized by the Kingsguard. They drag a hungover Daemon before the Iron Throne and throw him to the floor, and after they leave, Viserys walks in to confront his brother, accusing him of defiling his daughter, and kicking him in the ribs when he doesn't deny it. Daemon reminds Viserys that they visited most of the brothels on the Street of Silk when they were Rhaenyra's age, to which Viserys responds that they were young men, whereas Rhaenyra is just a girl. Daemon counters that Rhaenyra is legally a woman grown, and half-sarcastically says that it's better that her first experience is with him than some random whore. Enraged, Viserys demands to know what lord would wed her in this condition. Daemon says that it doesn't matter what any lord wants, as Viserys is the dragon, and his word is law. When Viserys angrily says that he should disinherit Rhaenyra as he did Daemon, Daemon brazenly says that he will wed her. Viserys stifles a laugh at the absurdity, as Daemon is already married to Rhea Royce, to which Daemon points out that Aegon the Conqueror took a second wife. Viserys is so insulted that he draws his Valyrian steel dagger and holds it to Daemon's throat, kneeling on his chest, and saying that he is no conqueror, but a plague upon their house. When Daemon continues to insist that if Viserys gives him Rhaenyra, together they will restore House Targaryen to its proper glory, Viserys bitterly accuses him of wanting his throne more than his daughter. Viserys rises, and dismissively tells Daemon to go back to the Vale and his lawful wife, and to try to restore what scrap of honor he may have left; or not, it makes no difference to him, as he never wants to see Daemon again.[6]
In his chambers, a rattled Viserys looks out from his balcony over the city while Alicent brings him a cup of wine. She tells him that she talked with Rhaenyra, and that she denied having sex with Daemon, and isn't known for being deceitful, whereas Daemon rarely tells the full truth, thus he was likely lying about having sex with Rhaenyra. Viserys is baffled as to how Daemon claiming such things could possibly serve him, to which Alicent suggests that Daemon's entire goal was simply to taunt his older brother for disinheriting him. Viserys says that whatever happened, he can still sense that Rhaenyra is not innocent of any wrongdoing. Alicent earnestly insists that Rhaenyra swore to her that she remains a maiden, and she believes her.[6]
That night, Viserys summons Rhaenyra to his quarters. He shows her the Valyrian steel dagger, which he has been heating in a brazier of fire, and explains to her that the dagger was carried by Aegon the Conqueror, and generations before him, by Aenar Targaryen when he left Valyria. Viserys further explains that before Aegon the Conqueror died, when he realized that the apocalyptic winter he saw in his dragon dream would not happen in his own lifetime, he sought to pass the warning on to future generations of their dynasty: in addition to passing the story down from king to heir, Aegon himself also commissioned the last of the old Valyrian pyromancers to etch a hidden message onto his personal dagger, only visible when it is heated red-hot. He hands the heated dagger to Rhaenyra, who reads off the High Valyrian glyphs on it: from my blood come the Prince That Was Promised and his will be the Song of Ice and Fire. Viserys says that the responsibility he has handed to Rhaenyra, the burden of this knowledge, is larger than the throne or herself, or her desires. She says that she hasn't been given a chance to defend herself, to which he replies that the truth doesn't matter: only the perception of it does. Rhaenyra protests that had she been born a man, she could bed whomever she wanted, even father a dozen bastards, and no one at court would blink an eye. Viserys bluntly tells her that she is right, but she was born a woman, which means she cannot. He says that Jaehaerys would have disinherited her for this, but he does not have that luxury, as his duty is to hold the realm together in preparation for the doom Aegon foresaw. They are on the verge of civil war with House Velaryon, and a marriage-alliance between their families is needed to reunite them with the rest of the realm. He commands Rhaenyra to marry Corlys's son Laenor Velaryon, a match he knows Corlys will only accept if Rhaenyra is the named heir to the Iron Throne. Rhaenyra begrudgingly accepts the match, but only on the condition that Viserys dismisses Otto Hightower as Hand of the King. Viserys at first scoffs that every lord on his council is self-interested somehow, not just Otto, but Rhaenyra insists that Otto is so self-interested that he would indeed jeopardize the stability of the realm in his goal to put an heir with Hightower blood on the throne. While reluctant, Viserys has not been blind to Otto's constant attempts at manipulation over the years, and he grudgingly relents.[6]
Later, Viserys summons Otto to the Small Council chamber. He immediately launches into the story of how his own father, Baelon Targaryen, died only five days after King Jaehaerys named him Hand, after which Otto took his place, and wonders how long it took Otto to start choosing his own interests over those of his king. Viserys says that Alicent did get him through the worst of his grief after Aemma died, but he now realizes that Otto set her up to be his wife to put his blood on the Iron Throne. Otto insists that Alicent loves him, as he knows Viserys loves her. Viserys doesn't deny this, but says that Otto's interests no longer align with those of the realm. Pained, Viserys says that the crown and the realm owe Otto a great debt that can never be repaid, but he can no longer trust his judgement. He dismisses Otto as Hand of the King, and removes his pin of office.[6]
Viserys then has Mellos deliver a bottle of moon tea to Rhaenyra, to rid herself of any "unwanted consequences" of whatever sexual encounters she may have had.[6]
With Otto Hightower dismissed, Viserys appoints Lord Lyonel Strong as Hand of the King. He later sails to Driftmark, the seat of House Velaryon, to discuss a marriage alliance between Rhaenyra and Ser Laenor Velaryon, the eldest son of Lord Corlys Velaryon. On his way to Driftmark, Viserys becomes seasick, and his health begins to worsen. They land in Spicetown and go the rest of the way to High Tide by wheelhouse. The royal party is greeted by Laena Velaryon, who tells Viserys that Corlys is too tired from a recent voyage to meet him. Lyonel voices the apparent insult that the Lord of Driftmark wasn't there to personally greet the king, but Viserys doesn't take it any further. Viserys proceeds to the Hall of Nine, the castle's main hall. There, Corlys receives him while seated on the Driftwood Throne, amused that the king came to him to discuss a marriage alliance. Corlys informs Viserys of the death of Rhea Royce. Rhaenys then enters the hall, making note of Viserys's lost fingers and deteriorating health. During the meeting, the marriage proposal is discussed, and Corlys agrees under a term: that Laenor and Rhaenyra's children take the surname Velaryon. Viserys comments on the fact that by doing so, a Velaryon would sit the Iron Throne after Rhaenyra. As such, he insists that when Laenor's eldest child takes the throne, they take on the name Targaryen. Corlys agrees to the terms. Viserys begins coughing more violently than before but insists that he is just tired and leaves shortly thereafter.[7]
Viserys returns to King's Landing after the marriage has been secured. Upon entering the Red Keep's courtyard, he collapses as soon as he dismounts from his carriage. He is rushed to his private chambers where he is attended to by maesters. While taking a bath, Viserys is told that the amputation of his two fingers on his left hand only slowed the infection, which years later is now spreading again. Grand Maester Mellos insists on additional leechings. Maester Orwyle suggests an alternative treatment by mixing new medicines in a poultice but Mellos dismisses the idea, claiming that leechings have always brought the king relief. After Mellos leaves, Orwyle provides Lyonel with a new medicine that will help the king sleep, before departing himself. Alone with Lyonel, Viserys laments that he wishes he would have been tested during his reign. He confides in Lyonel that he is afraid he will not be remembered, since he never embarked on any great conquest but he also never suffered any major defeats. Lyonel notes that many would consider that to be a good legacy. A pained Viserys smiles and remarks that a peaceful and uneventful reign rarely made for great songs sung at feasts. He ponders whether he would have been a different man if he had been allowed to rise to the occasion during a crisis in his youth. Lyonel says that many yearn to be tested, but when faced with a crisis, most men would wish it never came to them. Viserys respects his Hand's honesty, but he cannot help but think of the different life he may have had.[7]
Later on, the royal wedding ceremonies begin, starting with a grand feast at the Red Keep, followed by a planned seven days of tournaments and spectacle, then finally ending with the wedding ceremony itself. The feast, which is attended by envoys from most of the major noble houses, is held in the throne room. Viserys is seated next to Rhaenyra in the middle of the high table in front of the throne. They receive groups of lords, including Jason Lannister and Lord Hobert Hightower. Before long, the entourage of House Velaryon enters: Corlys, Rhaenys, Laena, Laenor, and Ser Vaemond, who take their seats at one side of the high table. Surprise grabs the attendants when Daemon enters after some distance behind the Velaryons, despite the fact that Viserys had exiled Daemon and forbade him to return. After a moment of tension, Viserys silently welcomes his brother. He orders another chair be brought up to the high table for Daemon, next to Lyonel Strong at the opposite side from the Velaryons. After the moment with Daemon has passed, Viserys rises to give a speech in praise of House Velaryon as the crown's most faithful and powerful allies, and that this marriage will unite both families as one.[7]
Just as Viserys conducts his speech, Alicent arrives dressed in green, intentionally interrupting him. When she reaches the high table she gives Viserys a curt peck on the cheek. Viserys returns to his speech, concluding with his hope that just as the Velaryons have followed the Targaryens since the Age of Dragons in Valyria, this new union will usher in a second Age of Dragons in Westeros.[7]
Viserys concernedly observes a conversation between Daemon and Gerold Royce. After Gerold leaves, Daemon joins the feast floor to dance with Rhaenyra. Viserys angrily watches on as the two come close to kissing, before being interrupted by a cry from beyond the hall. The floor soon erupts in a brawl.[7]
Viserys searches for Rhaenyra among the crowd, soon bleeding profusely from his nose due to the stress. After the ordeal, the guests are sent away and Viserys cancels the seven days of festivities. Instead, Laenor and Rhaenyra are quickly married in the messy throne room. Viserys collapses shortly after the vows are spoken.[7]
Ten years have passed since Rhaenyra and Laenor's wedding. After Rhaenyra shows her newborn third son to Alicent, Viserys enters to hold him. His physical appearance has deteriorated significantly: his hair has thinned out and his left arm is amputated. Despite this, he appears to be in good spirits. Viserys proudly watches his new grandson and remarks that he will make a fearsome knight. Later, as Viserys is working on his model of Valyria, Alicent discusses an incident with him concerning Aemond. The topic of Rhaenyra's children is brought up, in which Alicent implies that they were fathered by Harwin Strong.[8]
Viserys counters by stating that the nature of inheritance is a strange thing. He brings up an example of a stunning black mare he once owned, who escaped her stable and mated with an equally stunning silver stallion. However, their foal was a plain chestnut brown. Alicent asks if Viserys actually saw them mating, or if he just assumed the silver stallion was the only one the black mare was breeding with. Viserys rises and says he will hear no more of this. Sometime later, Viserys and Lyonel Strong are observing Aegon, Aemond, Jace and Luke at the training yard, which erupts in a brawl when Harwin Strong punches Criston Cole over his unfair treatment over Rhaenyra's children and his insinuation of their parentage.[8]
After the incident in the training yard, Viserys is present during a Small Council meeting where the renewed fighting in the Stepstones is discussed. Dorne has sided with the Triarchy, and Viserys bitterly remarks that he hoped his ongoing negotiations with House Martell would keep them out of the conflict, but that shows what he gets over trusting a Martell. After talks about the Stepstones is finished, Rhaenyra speaks of the recent tensions between their two families and proposes a betrothal between her son Jace and Alicent's daughter Helaena, which Viserys considers a judicious proposal. Alicent claims she would consider it.[8]
Later, Alicent privately argues with Viserys that the offer was an insult. She thinks Rhaenyra only made the offer because she is backed into a corner. Viserys attempts to urge her that the betrothal would bring peace to the royal family and as king he should be able to make this choice, but Alicent sharply says that he can do what he wants when she's cold in her grave. Later in Viserys' chambers, Lyonel arrives to offer his resignation as Hand of the King due to recent rumors. Viserys asks him what the rumors are, yet Lyonel cannot say them aloud. Viserys says that if he cannot bring himself to speak of these rumors, he will not accept his resignation. Lyonel agrees, but asks to take Harwin back to Harrenhal, which Viserys allows.[8]
At Driftmark, Viserys and the royal court have arrived to attend the funeral of Laena Velaryon. During the funeral, Viserys goes to speak with Daemon and attempts to reconcile. He asks him to return home to King's Landing and let their prior differences stay in the past. Daemon says that his home is in Pentos, and that of his children. Viserys urges that there is still a place for Daemon at his side in the royal court and offers anything Daemon might need, but he cuts him off. Daemon states that he needs nothing and promptly leaves. During the evening of the funeral, Viserys is exhausted and retires for the night. He stammers Aemma Arryn's name to Alicent, though Harrold Westerling gently corrects him.[9]
Later at Driftmark, the royal court is roused in the Hall of Nine after an incident between Aemond, Jace, Luke, and Daemon's daughters Baela and Rhaena. During a fight, Luke severely injured Aemond. Viserys enters and angrily accosts the Kingsguard for not protecting the princes, to which Ser Criston protests they didn't expect to defend the princes from each other. Maester Kelvyn, who stitches up Aemond, says that his left eye is lost, much to Alicent's horror. When asked what happened, the children begin arguing with each other, to which Viserys shouts for silence. Jace whispers to Rhaenyra that Aemond had called them bastards.[9]
Viserys asks Aemond to tell him the truth of the matter, but Alicent angrily interjects that their son has been maimed and Rhaenyra's sons are responsible, and nothing else matters. Viserys asks where the boys' father, Ser Laenor, might be, to which Alicent snidely remarks that he must be "entertaining" his squires. Viserys turns to Aemond to ask him where he heard the rumors of Jace and Luke's bastardy, who says he heard it from Aegon. Viserys then angrily demands Aegon to tell him where he himself heard this, to which he states that everyone already knows. Viserys commands that they are one family and must cease this infighting. He orders them all to make their apologies and show good will to each other by command of their king, father, and grandsire. Alicent says it is insufficient and demands one of Rhaenyra's sons' eyes as recompense. Viserys is aghast, but Alicent commands Criston Cole to bring her the eye of Lucerys. He hesitates, protesting his oath as her sworn shield and protector does not extend to maiming others of the royal family at her command. Viserys insists that the matter is finished, and from now onward anyone who dares to question the legitimacy of Rhaenyra's sons will have their tongue cut out. Shaking with grief and fury, Alicent refuses to accept this: as Viserys turns to leave she pulls the Valyrian steel dagger from his belt and rushes across the room towards Luke, but is stopped by Rhaenyra. Both Viserys and Otto demand Alicent to put down her blade. As Alicent tries to break free from Rhaenyra's grasp, she slices the princess's forearm. Viserys again declares the business finished, and leaves.[9]
The next day Viserys, Alicent, and their entourage leave on their ship back to King's Landing.[9]
Six years have passed since the funeral of Laena Velaryon. Viserys's condition has worsened significantly in the years past. He is bedridden and has suffered a significant weight loss and the removal of his right eye. Meanwhile, the Hightowers have largely taken control of the court, removing Targaryen heraldry and tapestries and replacing them with statues and symbols of the Faith of the Seven. After Corlys Velaryon suffers a grievous injury during renewed fighting in the Stepstones and is on the brink of death, his brother Vaemond, not expecting Viserys to have a say in the matter, is brazen about attempting to claim the title of Lord of the Tides after Corlys on account of the bastardy of Rhaenyra's children.[10]
Rhaenyra and Daemon arrive at the Red Keep to defend Luke's inheritance, first visiting Viserys's apartments. His model city of Old Valyria is covered in dust and cobwebs, having been unattended for years. Much to their horror, Viserys is bedridden, disorientated and clearly in pain, his hair all but gone, his teeth rotten, and his face swathed in bandages. Daemon brings up the matter of Corlys being wounded in the Stepstones and the succession of Driftmark being disputed, only for a delirious Viserys to insist that both are already settled. Daemon urges Viserys to support Lucerys's claim over Vaemond's, but Viserys confusedly remarks that Alicent and Otto attend to court business. Later, Rhaenyra introduces Viserys to his new grandsons: Aegon and Viserys. Viserys is delighted to see the children, joking that the younger has a name fit for a king. The children start to wail, and Viserys, stricken by a sudden onset of pain, insists that he needs his tea, pointing to a cup by his bedside. Daemon suspiciously smells the tea, confirming that it has powerful opiates such as milk of the poppy.[10]
The same night, in Viserys's room, Rhaenyra comes and sits by his bedside. He awakens and briefly mistakes her for Alicent before Rhaenyra corrects him. Rhaenyra then asks her father if he believes the Song of Ice and Fire, the prophetic dream of Aegon the Conqueror, to be true. She reminds Viserys that he told her it was their duty to hold the realm united against the return of a coming evil, but warns that his naming her heir divided the realm and that she has found the burden of that duty a heavy one to bear. Rhaenyra tearfully pleads for her father to defend her and her children if he believes the dream true, but Viserys is too delirious from pain, illness, and medication to respond.[10]
The next morning, as Grand Maester Orwyle and several acolytes tend to Viserys's affliction, the king orders Otto to arrange a supper that night with all of his family in attendance, as well as refusing milk of the poppy. Later that day, Otto calls the throne room into session to hear petitions about the inheritance to Driftmark. The crowd is stunned when Viserys enters, wearing a golden half-mask. Flanked by Sers Arryk and Erryk Cargyll, he makes his way to the throne, hunched over and clearly having trouble walking. He passes a glance to a surprised Rhaenyra and Alicent, then telling Otto that he will sit the throne for the day. Otto makes way for Viserys to walk the steps to the throne, but is visibly struggling. One of the Cargylls walks over to help him, but Viserys dismisses him. Viserys stops midway as his crown falls and he looks up to see Daemon helping his brother to the throne, placing the crown back on his head.[10]
Viserys remarks his confusion about discussing a succession that has already been settled. He states that the only one present who could offer more insight into Lord Corlys's wishes is the Princess Rhaenys. Rhaenys reaffirms her husband's wishes for Luke to inherit Driftmark and also gives her approval to wed Jace and Luke to Baela and Rhaena. Viserys declares the matter settled and reaffirms Luke's inheritance. Vaemond speaks out about the decision, refusing to allow Viserys to dictate House Velaryon's future. Viserys tells Vaemond that he is forgetting his place, reminding him that he is only a second son. Vaemond finally angers the king by loudly calling Luke and Jace bastards and Rhaenyra a whore. Viserys rises and threatens to cut out his tongue with his Valyrian steel dagger, before Daemon decapitates Vaemond with Dark Sister. The stress causes Viserys to collapse into the throne, but despite a panicking Rhaenyra and Alicent pleading with him to take medical assistance, Viserys refuses, insisting that he must make things right.[10]
That evening, the members of House Targaryen gather for supper. Viserys is carried in on a chair. At the head of the table, Viserys expresses his joy and sadness to see his family gathered tonight. He notes how the family have grown distant to each other in the years past, and proceeds to remove his mask, showing his disfiguration to all present. He jokes how his face is no longer a handsome one—if it ever was—but stresses that he wishes to have everyone see who he truly is: not just a king but a husband, father, and grandsire. He acknowledges that he will not be alive for much longer and insists that they not hold ill feelings for each other anymore. He exclaims that the crown cannot stand strong if the House of the Dragon remains divided. He pleads for his family to set aside their grievances; if not for the sake of the Crown, then for Viserys's. After Viserys sits back down, Rhaenyra stands to give a toast to Alicent, who in turn gives a toast for her. Tensions have simmered, and Viserys looks on lovingly to see his family interact with each other happily. However, the pain grows too great and he is forced to leave the dinner.[10]
That night, Alicent visits Viserys in his chamber. Deliriously, Viserys mistakes her for Rhaenyra and admits Aegon's dream to her. Alicent mistakes this for Viserys wishing to see their son Aegon on the throne, and she promises him that it will be done. After Alicent leaves, Viserys calls out for Aemma and dies.[10]
Personality
Viserys was a kind, amiable, and peaceful person. In contract to his quarrelsome brother, he loathed violence and prefered to make peace between enemies. It did not mean he was weak or a coward: when it was necessary, he would use his authority to punish wrongdoers,[6][10] but was also capable of forgiveness. Viserys deeply loved Aemma and losing her affected him so much that he still could not forget her. He was fond of making sculptures, spending time working on his model of Old Valyria.
In his last day, no matter how physically weak he was, he showed everyone his inner strength by appearing at the Great Hall and confirming what he decided earlier about the inheritance issue.[10] Unfortunately, as much as Viserys tried to prevent the conflict over the inheritance, the Dance of the Dragons broke out anyway.
Viserys was not stubborn, and occasionally would reconsider his decisions, but was by no means fickle or hesitant: regarding issues of top priority (the inheritance issue), he would consistently stick to his decisions till his last day.
Family tree
1 Jaehaerys had thirteen children in all. For simplicity, only the direct ancestors of future generations are on this family tree and they are not in the exact order of birth. The thirteen children in correct order are: Aegon, Daenerys, Aemon, Baelon, Alyssa, Maegelle, Vaegon, Daella, Saera, Viserra, Gaemon, Valerion, and Gael.
2 While Jacaerys, Lucerys, and Joffrey are officially Laenor's, he and Rhaenyra never had any biological issue. His three sons are in fact fathered by Harwin Strong.

- "Many in my line have been dragonriders. Very few among us have been dreamers. What is the power of a dragon next to the power of prophecy? When Rhaenyra was a child... I saw it in a dream. As vivid as these flames, I saw it. A male babe born to me, wearing the Conqueror's crown. And I so wanted it to be true, to be a dreamer myself. I sought that vision again, night after night, but it never came again. I poured all my thought and will into it. And my obsession killed Rhaenyra's mother. I thought Rhaenyra was the way out of my abyss of grief and regret, and naming her heir would begin to set things right. I never imagined I would remarry... that I would have a son. What if I was wrong?"

My own face is no longer a handsome one, if indeed it ever was. But tonight, I wish you to see me as I am. Not just a king, but your father. Your brother. Your husband, and your grandsire... who may not, it seems, walk for much longer among you. Let us no longer hold ill feelings in our hearts.

Spoken about Viserys
- "Fourteen succession claims were heard, but only two were truly considered: Princess Rhaenys Targaryen, the king's eldest descendant; and her younger cousin, Prince Viserys Targaryen, the king's eldest male descendant. Rhaenys, a woman, would not inherit the Iron Throne. The lords instead chose Viserys, my father."
- ―Rhaenyra Targaryen
- "It is declared by all lords paramount and lords vassal of the Seven Kingdoms that Prince Viserys Targaryen be made Prince of Dragonstone."

- ―Rhaenyra Targaryen
- "I do know how passionate you are for the histories."
- ―Alicent Hightower
- "You're weak, Viserys. And that council of leeches knows it. They all prey on you for their own ends."
- ―Daemon Targaryen
- Alicent: "Your father loves you. He chose you for his heir."
- Rhaenyra: "He didn't choose me, he spurns Daemon."
- — Alicent Hightower and Rhaenyra Targaryen[src]
- "It was never my brother's strongest trait. Being king."
- ―Daemon Targaryen
- "You must guide Viserys towards reason. He'll never find it on his own."

- "Once we smashed the Triarchy in the Stepstones, they named me King of the Narrow Sea. But I know that there is only one true king, Your Grace. My crown and the Stepstones are yours."
- ―Daemon Targaryen
- "And now we come to the matter of the great iron chair, and whose bum it might bear. Our good king names his daughter, a girl, his heir. But then to him, a babe is born. To which heir might the chair bear? Who will it be? The brother? The daughter? Or the little princeling of three?"
- ―Theatre player
- "The king will die. It may be months or years, but he'll not live to be an old man."
- ―Otto Hightower
- Alicent: "My father and I are mere stewards of the king's will and wisdom."

- — Alicent and Daemon[src]
- "You told me it was our duty to hold the realm united against a common foe. By naming me heir, you divided the realm."
- ―Rhaenyra Targaryen
- "We grieve for Viserys the Peaceful. Our sovereign, our friend. But he has left us a gift. With his last breath, he impressed upon the queen his final wish: that his son, Aegon, should succeed him as Lord of the Seven Kingdoms."

- ―Lyman Beesbury
- "My brother was a slave to his omens and portents. Anything to make his feckless reign appear to have purpose."
- ―Daemon Targaryen
- "Feeble and foolish, the old king refused to change the succession. He didn't even see how his court had split into two rival camps of Blacks and Greens."
- ―Viserys Targaryen
- "It must be noted that Viserys did not squander his predecessor's legacy. Although the Dance of Dragons scarred the Seven Kingdoms for generations, it would be difficult to lay the blame for it at the feet of the king. It was his love for his children, and his desire to keep the peace that allowed the tensions to fester as they did."

Behind the scenes
On October 5, 2020, HBO announced that Paddy Considine had signed on for House of the Dragon in the role of Viserys I Targaryen. The character breakdown reads as follows:
- "Viserys was chosen by the lords of Westeros to succeed the Old King, Jaehaerys Targaryen, at the Great Council at Harrenhal. A warm, kind, and decent man, Viserys only wishes to carry forward his grandfather's legacy, but as we've learned from Game of Thrones, good men do not necessarily make for great kings."
- ―HBO
In the books
In Fire & Blood, Viserys I was the grandson of King Jaehaerys I, who was the longest-reigning King of the Seven Kingdoms in history, ruling for 55 years. Jaehaerys I ruled for so long that his son predeceased him, and he was directly succeeded by Viserys I, who then ruled for 26 years. Between the two of them, they presided over an 80 year golden age for the Targaryen dynasty, with entire generations that were born and died knowing only the peace and prosperity brought by the dragon-kings' unification of the continent.
Physically, Viserys I was a plump and pleasant man, amiable to those around him. He grew up in and ruled over a time of plenty, so he was fat and jovial, though he was still an effective monarch. He was loved by both the nobility and the smallfolk. As king, he wore the seven-jeweled crown of his predecessor, Jaehaerys I. Viserys was the last rider of the dragon Balerion the Black Dread. He did not ride him long or extensively, as the beast died of old age in 94 AC, late in the reign of Jaehaerys I and nine years before Viserys I succeeded him as king. Although at the time there were more Targaryen dragons than under the reign of any monarch before or since, Viserys I never bonded with another dragon.
Jaehaerys I and his sister-wife Good Queen Alysanne had nine children who grew to adulthood, of which four had (legitimate) children of their own - though two of them were in a brother-sister marriage. They had four grandchildren, of which two also married each other. Their eldest son Aemon married Jocelyn Baratheon, and produced one daughter named Rhaenys before his untimely death. Their second son Baelon married his own sister Alyssa, and they produced two surviving children: sons Viserys and Daemon. Younger sister Daella married Lord Rodrik Arryn, but died giving birth to Aemma Arryn - who eventually married her first cousin Viserys, and bore his daughter Rhaenyra.
Aemon was killed in a skirmish with pirates in 92 AC, after which Jaehaerys declared that his second son Baelon would replace him as royal heir - even though according to the traditional primogeniture laws followed by the Andals in Westeros, Aemon's child should have inherited instead of his younger brother. Later in 101 AC, Baelon suddenly died of a burst appendix: while under traditional law Baelon's own heir was his eldest son Viserys, the spurned Velaryons used the opportunity to again press their claim that Baelon never should have been considered the royal heir in the first place, and by right of primogeniture inheritance should pass to Rhaenys. Failing that, they insisted that the throne should at least pass to the next male produced from Rhaenys's bloodline, her son Laenor. Viserys and his supporters claimed he should be heir on the principle of male proximity, not primogeniture, as he could claim unbroken male descent from father to son (no major group in Westeros is known to have practiced proximity-based inheritance before, but many did not want to see a woman ascend to the Iron Throne).
To prevent a civil war, Jaehaerys convened the Great Council of 101 AC in which all the great and minor lords of Westeros gathered to debate on the issue. It focused down to a vote between Viserys and Laenor, and Viserys won the final tally in a landslide of about twenty to one. Faced with such opposition, the Velaryons grudgingly accepted the result of the council, though they remained estranged from Viserys's new royal court.
In the books, Viserys's cause of death is unclear. Towards the end of his life, he suffered from a series of health issues such as gout and obesity (as opposed to his emaciated appearance in "The Lord of the Tides"). It is not mentioned in Fire and Blood if Viserys ever suffered from a form of leprosy, though he did have his fingers removed by Maester Gerardys after cutting himself on the Iron Throne in fear of developing an infection.
The epithet "the Peaceful" was invented for Viserys in House of the Dragon; the only nickname applied to him in Fire & Blood is the "the Young King," contrasting him with his predecessor Jaehaerys ("the Old King").

Notes
- ↑ In "The Lord of the Tides," Rhaenys says it has been 6 years since she last saw her husband Corlys, who left to fight in the War for the Stepstones shortly after the deaths of Laena and Laenor in 126 AC. Therefore "The Lord of the Tides," "The Green Council," and "The Black Queen" take place in 132 AC (the latter two take place directly after the former).
- ↑ High Valyrian: Viserys I Targārien
- ↑ House of the Dragon starts in the year 112 AC according to the reference book Game of Thrones: House of the Dragon: Inside the Creation of a Targaryen Dynasty. This is the ninth year of Viserys I Targaryen's reign per "The Heirs of the Dragon." Therefore Jaehaerys I Targaryen died in 103 AC, same as in the books.

Princess Rhaenys Targaryen,[N 1] also known as Rhaenys Velaryon[N 2] and the Queen Who Never Was, is a princess of the Targaryen dynasty, and the wife of Lord Corlys Velaryon. She is a dragonrider, her mount being Meleys, the Red Queen.
Biography
Background
Rhaenys is the granddaughter of Jaehaerys I Targaryen, the daughter of Aemon Targaryen and Jocelyn Baratheon, and the first cousin of Viserys I Targaryen and Daemon Targaryen. She is named after her great-great-grandmother: Rhaenys Targaryen, the sister-wife of Aegon the Conqueror.
Rhaenys married Corlys Velaryon, admiral of the Targaryen fleets and currently the wealthiest living man in Westeros, having grown rich on trading expeditions he personally made to the Further East of Essos. Rhaenys and Corlys have two children: their daughter Laena Velaryon and son Laenor Velaryon.
Rhaenys's father Aemon died before her grandfather King Jaehaerys did, after which Jaehaerys made the decision to name his second son, Rhaenys's uncle Baelon Targaryen, as his heir. This proved controversial, since according to traditional inheritance law based on primogeniture, a lord's daughter stands ahead of his younger brother in the line of succession. As a result, Rhaenys is called "The Queen Who Never Was". Baelon himself died a few years later, also while Jaehaerys was still alive, leaving two rival male claimants to the Iron Throne: Rhaenys's own son Laenor (based on primogeniture), or Rhaenys's first cousin Viserys (the son of her uncle Baelon, and thus an unbroken male line). Fearing a civil war, Jaehaerys solved the issue by holding the Great Council of 101 AC in which all the lords of Westeros held a vote, and elected Viserys as heir to the throne. Jaehaerys died of old age a few years later and Viserys ascended to the throne.[2]
House of the Dragon: Season 1
At the Heir's Tournament held to celebrate the impending birth of Viserys's son Baelon, Rhaenys comments scathingly to her husband Corlys that the knights participating are as "green as summer grass" and none have actually seen real battle. When Viserys's wife Aemma Arryn dies from childbirth complications and Baelon does not long survive her, Rhaenys is among the family members and courtiers present at their joint funeral.[3]
Rhaenys and her husband meet with King Viserys and propose a marriage alliance between the widower monarch and their daughter Laena, uniting the greatest surviving houses of Old Valyria. While Viserys is very hesitant at the idea of marrying a child, he understands the importance of producing more heirs to secure his line. Rhaenys later speaks to Rhaenyra—Viserys's only surviving child and designated heir to the Iron Throne—and gives her a blunt lesson in politics: as much as the lords of Westeros have sworn to uphold Rhaenyra's position as her father's heir, she knows from personal experience that such oaths can easily be reneged on, and that having a woman on the throne is a much more controversial prospect than the young princess realizes.[4]
Viserys arrives at the Velaryon island stronghold of High Tide to negotiate with Corlys, who had previously resigned as Master of Ships on the king's Small Council over Viserys's decision to marry Alicent Hightower rather than Laena.[4] Rhaenys seems concerned at the apparently ill health of her cousin, but Viserys dismisses the matter and proposes that his daughter Rhaenyra should marry Laena's brother Laenor, and their firstborn child would someday inherit the Iron Throne. Both sides agree to the terms, but Rhaenys privately confesses to her husband that Laenor's secret preference for men may only cause further complications. She also admits that she made peace long ago with the fact that she wasn't chosen as queen.[5]
Family tree
Paternal
1 Jaehaerys had thirteen children in all. For simplicity, only the direct ancestors of future generations are on this family tree and they are not in the exact order of birth. The thirteen children in correct order are: Aegon, Daenerys, Aemon, Baelon, Alyssa, Maegelle, Vaegon, Daella, Saera, Viserra, Gaemon, Valerion, and Gael.
2 While Jacaerys, Lucerys, and Joffrey are officially Laenor's, he and Rhaenyra never had any biological issue. His three sons are in fact fathered by Harwin Strong.

Quotes
Spoken by Rhaenys
- "I understand the order of things. I'm not sure you do. [...] Whether it's to my daughter or someone else's, your father will remarry sooner than late. His new wife will produce new heirs, and chances are better than not that one of those will be male. And when that boy comes of age and your father has passed, the men of the realm will expect him to be heir, not you. Because that is the order of things."
- ―Rhaenys, to Rhaenyra
- Daemon: "That whore of a queen murdered my brother and stole his throne, and you could have burned them all for it."
- Rhaenys: "A war is like to be fought over this treachery, to be sure. But that war is not mine to begin."
- — Daemon, referring to Alicent, and Rhaenys[src]

Behind the scenes
Rhaenys Targaryen was revealed to be a recurring character in House of the Dragon on December 8, 2020. On February 11, 2021, HBO announced that Eve Best had signed on for the series. The character breakdown reads as follows:
- "A dragonrider and wife to Lord Corlys Velaryon, "The Queen Who Never Was" was passed over as heir to the throne at the Great Council because the realm favored her cousin, Viserys, simply for being male."
- ―HBO
There were actually three members of the Targaryen dynasty named "Rhaenys" over the three centuries of their rule. George R.R. Martin intentionally had names repeat like this because it's what happened in the real Middle Ages, i.e. all of the kings and princes in England named "Henry", "Edward", or "William". The first Rhaenys was the sister-wife of Aegon the Conqueror, while the second Rhaenys - wife of Corlys Velaryon - lived over a century after her death. This second Rhaenys is the granddaughter of Jaehaerys I, the first Rhaenys's grandson. The third Rhaenys was Rhaegar Targaryen's first child, with Elia Martell, who was killed during the Sack of King's Landing when she was only three years old. In the books, the second Rhaenys is usually distinguished by calling her "Rhaenys, daughter of Aemon", "Corlys's wife Rhaenys" etc., or the nickname "Rhaenys, the Queen Who Never Was". The House of the Dragon TV series seems to have approached clarifying this by simply referring to her by her married surname, "Rhaenys Velaryon". The books never actually call her that, but it is by no means inaccurate - George R.R. Martin himself said that whether married noblewomen drop their maiden name or not is usually up to personal preference, typically keeping their original surname if their family is more prestigious than their husband's. For example, "Cersei Baratheon" is hardly ever used for Cersei Lannister, though it isn't technically incorrect - while "Catelyn Stark" is also called "Catelyn Tully" more or less interchangeably.
In the books
In Fire & Blood, Rhaenys Targaryen was the daughter of Prince Aemon Targaryen and Lady Jocelyn Baratheon, born in 74 AC on the seventh day of the seventh month. She was a great beauty with Baratheon black hair and Targaryen pale violet eyes. By the age of fifty-five she had a lean lined face and her hair was streaked with white. She was clever, capable, spirited, proud, fierce, and fearless, with a fiery temperament. In battle, she wore steel and copper armor that flashed in the sun.
Her father was the Prince of Dragonstone, and since she was his firstborn child many considered Rhaenys to be next in line to the Iron Throne. Her grandmother Queen Alysanne called her "our queen to be."
In 89 AC she joined her grandfather King Jaehaerys I for part of his royal progress. She flew to Highgarden on her dragon Meleys to meet up with the king and together they flew to all four of the Shield Islands. During this trip she informed him of her intention to marry Lord Corlys Velaryon and he gave her his blessing. She married Corlys the following year, arriving at the wedding on Meleys at her own insistence, and two years later she learned that she was pregnant with her first child.
In 92 AC, Rhaenys's father died, and the king was forced to formally appoint a new heir to the throne. Rhaenys's uncle Baelon was chosen as the new heir, causing Rhaenys to protest the decision and her husband Corlys to give up his position as lord admiral and his place on the Small Council. Rhaenys's mother and grandmother were both angered by the decision, as was her uncle Boremund Baratheon.
Rhaenys and Corlys returned to Driftmark and in 92 AC she gave birth to a daughter, Laena Velaryon, and a son Laenor in 94 AC. Both House Velaryon and House Baratheon claimed that Laenor had a stronger claim to the throne, but Baelon remained King Jaehaerys's heir.
Baelon died in 101 AC and King Jaehaerys held a Great Council at Harrenhal to determine the line of succession. Rhaenys and her children were among fourteen claims considered: she and her daughter Laena were rejected on account of their sex, but the final candidates were Viserys and Rhaenys's son Laenor. Rhaenys's uncle Boremund and Lord Ellard Stark were both outspoken in their support of her claim, along with House Dustin and House Manderly. Corlys used his wealth to persuade the vassal Houses along the coasts of the narrow sea to support Laenor's claim as well, such as Lords Bar Emmon and Celtigar. In the final vote, however, Baelon's son Viserys won by a wide margin: while the ballot was secret, it was rumored that he beat Laenor by a factor of twenty to one. Following this, the fool Mushroom gave Rhaenys the moniker of "The Queen Who Never Was," which became a popular nickname for her among the commoners.

- ―Criston to Rhaenyra Targaryen
Ser Criston Cole, known to history as the Kingmaker,[1] is a knight of House Cole and the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard under Aegon II Targaryen. He previously served as a member of the Kingsguard under Viserys I Targaryen and as Rhaenyra Targaryen's personal guard.
Biography
Background
Criston is a member of House Cole, a minor House of the Dornish Marches in service to House Dondarrion. His father is the steward at Blackhaven. Criston is of Dornish descent.[2]
Criston fought for a year as a footsoldier in border conflicts with Dorne. After taking part in the razing of two watchtowers along the Boneway, he was knighted by Ser Arlan Dondarrion.[3]
House of the Dragon: Season 1
Criston competes in the Heir's Tournament. In his first joust he defeats a knight of House Tarly. He then defeats Lord Boremund and another Baratheon. Criston next faces Prince Daemon Targaryen after several evenly matched tilts, Daemon is unhorsed by him, with Daemon then demanding a contest of arms on foot. Criston readies his flail as the prince draws his sword Dark Sister. In fierce combat, Criston breaks apart Daemon's shield, with Daemon swinging at his breastplate in return. With the prince eventually kicking Criston to the ground and as Daemon gloats, Criston rises to his feet and knocks him to the ground and forces the prince to yield. After his victory, Criston asks for the favor of Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen, who obliges throwing her laurel wreath down to him and wishes him luck.[4]
Six months after the tourney Ser Criston is named to the Kingsguard, at the insistence of Princess Rhaenyra, as he is the only candidate who has real combat experience. He later travels to Dragonstone with a detachment of men led by Ser Otto Hightower, the Hand of the King, to force Prince Daemon to give up his occupation of the castle. When Daemon "accidentally" calls him "Ser Crispin", Criston retorts by reminding Daemon of how he defeated him at the Heir's Tournament. The situations escalates, and both sides draw their swords, but Princess Rhaenyra arrives and manages to convince Daemon to return the dragon egg without bloodshed.[3]
Three years later, King Viserys organizes a royal hunt in the Kingswood, in honor of his son Aegon's second nameday. Before departure, the king approaches Ser Criston, asking after the whereabouts of Rhaenyra, but Criston confesses he doesn't know where she is.[5]
Later, at the camp in the Kingswood, Criston sees Rhaenyra storm out of the tent and ride off on her horse. He swiftly mounts his own horse and chases after her. He manages to catch her, and she tells him that her father was trying to marry her off to Lord Jason Lannister. Criston jokingly asks if she wants him to kill Jason, which seems to amuse Rhaenyra. He tells her they should return to camp, but she suggests they take in the Kingswood. As they walk, Rhaenyra asks him if he was ever betrothed, to which he confesses that his station was never high enough for a formal betrothal, though he could have married a common-born girl had he wished. Rhaenyra tells him he's lucky to have a say in his own life, as despite being the princess, she feels she has no real power. Criston reminds her that it was only because of her that he became a Kingsguard - the highest honor any member of his house has ever known.[5]
That night, as he and Rhaenyra sit by a fire, Criston requests once again, that they return to camp, as her father will be worried, but she is still unwilling. Rhaenyra asks him if he thinks the people will ever truly accept her as their ruler, to which he replies that they will have no choice but to. At that moment, there is a rustling in the nearby bushes. Criston pulls out his sword, preparing to defend his princess from danger. After a tense silence, a boar charges out of the bushes, knocking Criston over, and attacking Rhaenyra. Criston recovers, and runs the boar through with his sword, saving his princess, who finishes the beast off by stabbing it multiple times in rage.[5]
As the two of them head back to camp with their kill, they are approached by another animal: A white hart. Criston slowly draws his sword, but Rhaenyra softly tells him not to. He obeys, and the stag turns and runs off. When they return to camp with the dead boar, they are greeted by incredulous stares from everyone gathered.[5]
Some time later, Ser Criston accompanies Princess Rhaenyra on a tour to find potential suitors for her hand. During an audience at Storm's End. Rhaenyra dismisses every suitor that approaches, and when a fight breaks out between Willem Blackwood and Jerrel Bracken, she tells Criston that they're leaving, and orders him to have their ship prepared to return to King's Landing, even though the tour was supposed to continue on to Bitterbridge. As they are leaving, they hear a yell, and turn to see that Willem has run Jerrel through with his sword. Criston tells Rhaenyra to look away.[6]
As they sail back to King's Landing, Rhaenyra asks Criston if she thinks her father will be angry, to which Criston sarcastically asks whether she refers to her refusal of all the suitors or her ending the tour early. Just then, they hear a dragon's cry overhead. Criston orders everyone to take cover, before Caraxes swoops down, brushing their ship, and dangerously rocking it. Criston immediately checks on the princess, and calls for the maesters, but Rhaenyra insists she's fine.[6]
That night, Criston bids Rhaenyra goodnight and stands guard outside her bedroom door. Several hours later, much to his bewilderment, Rhaenyra (who, unbeknownst to him, had slipped out of her room through a secret passage and joined Daemon for a night on the town) enters her bedroom again, now dressed as a commoner. As he checks to make sure she's all right, Rhaenyra, sexually charged from her exploits with Daemon, playfully grabs his helmet from him and holds it out of reach, despite his impatient requests that she return it. Eventually, she holds it out to him, and kisses him when he moves to take it, stunning him. Ignoring his halfhearted protests, Rhaenyra begins to slowly strip Criston of his armor. Criston hesitates, looking meaningfully at his white cloak as he takes it off, torn between his vow of chastity and his desire for (and reluctance to disobey) his princess. Eventually, he gives into temptation and starts kissing her back, and they share a night of ecstasy.[6]
The next morning, Criston, visibly uncomfortable after the previous night's encounter, enters Rhaenyra's chambers to give her a summons from Queen Alicent Hightower.[6]
That evening, Criston and several other members of the Kingsguard, escort Rhaenyra to her father's chambers. Criston is visibly nervous as he opens the door for her.[6]
Criston accompanies Rhaenyra, Viserys, and the new King's Hand, Lord Lyonel Strong, to Driftmark, to propose a marriage to Lord Corlys Velaryon between Rhaenyra and his son Ser Laenor Velaryon. On the way back, Criston, still guilt-ridden over breaking his Kingsguard vow, approaches Rhaenyra, and asks her to run away with him to Essos, where she could marry him - a marriage for love, not duty. As Rhaenyra has often talked about how much she hates her position, Criston believes this would benefit both of them: She would get to do as she wishes, and he could escape the shame of breaking his vow. After a few seconds of silence, however, Rhaenyra refuses, saying that she doesn't want to live in infamy, and must do her duty, no matter how much she may hate it. She does, however, inform him that she and Laenor have come to an understanding: After they perform their royal duty, they each pursue their own desires. Criston, distraught and angry, accuses her of wanting to make him his whore. He gave up his honor and soiled his white cloak - the only thing he has to his name - for Rhaenyra, and with her refusal, he now sees no way of restoring it.[7]
Upon returning to King's Landing, Criston is summoned by Queen Alicent, who questions him about a rumor she heard that Rhaenyra had been involved in a "breach of morals". Unbeknownst to him, the rumor she refers to is that Rhaenyra had sex with her uncle Daemon, but Criston believes that she has learned about his own sexual encounter with Rhaenyra. Seeing one last chance to restore his honor in death, Criston confesses his sin, only asking for a merciful death. Alicent, however, merely thanks him for his honesty and dismisses him.[7]
Throughout the welcoming feast for Rhaenyra and Laenor's marriage, Criston stands by, watching them dance together, visibly on edge. He is approached by Ser Joffrey Lonmouth, who subtly admits to being Laenor's paramour, and hints that he knows Criston's secret. Joffrey tells Criston that they should swear to guard the two of them and their secrets for the sake of them all. This perceived threat pushes Criston over the edge, and he starts pummeling Joffrey, to the shock and horror of everyone gathered. When Laenor tries to pull him off, Criston punches him before proceeding to beat Joffrey to death, caving in the entire left side of his face. After staring down at his victim for a few seconds, Criston silently rises and walks out, everyone too terrified to stop him.[7]
Criston walks out to the godswood, removing his white cloak and his sword, and with his honor now beyond repair and nothing else to live for, prepares to take his own life with his dagger. However, his suicide attempt is interrupted by Queen Alicent who calls out to him.[7]
A decade later, Criston is now a firm ally of Queen Alicent in return for her saving him at his lowest. While operating as a master-at-arms for Rhaenyra and Alicent's sons, Criston intentionally allows Aegon, Alicent's eldest son, to roughhouse Jacaerys Velaryon, Rhaenyra's eldest son. When Harwin Strong intervenes, Criston alludes to the rumor that Jacaerys and his brothers Lucerys and Joffrey are Harwin's bastard sons, which provokes Harwin to start beating him. The fallout over this leads Harwin to leave King's Landing.[8]
At the funeral of Laena Velaryon, Criston notices Lord Larys Strong staring at Alicent. While Alicent assures him that it is simply Larys's pride at becoming the new Lord of Harrenhal, Criston remains suspicious. He is later given the night's watch by Lord Commander Harrold Westerling.[9]
Criston is among the Kingsguard who separate Rhaenyra and Daemon's children from Prince Aemond, who has lost an eye in the fight. Everyone is summoned to the Hall of Nine by the king, who berates the Kingsguard for failing to prevent the fight. Criston tries to shift blame onto Jace, Luke, Baela, and Rhaena, but Viserys silences him. Alicent later orders Criston to take one of Luke's eyes as revenge, but he stays put. When she tries to do it herself, Criston follows her, but he is held back by Daemon.[9]
Six years following these events, Criston has tutored Aemond into becoming a skilled warrior. The prince bests him in a sparring match, to which Criston says he will be winning tournaments in no time.[10]
After the death of King Viserys, Criston attends the subsequent meeting of the Small Council. He moves behind Lord Lyman Beesbury when he protests the accession of Prince Aegon to the throne, and accidentally kills him in an attempt to seat him, puncturing his skull against his council totem. Ser Harrold then orders Criston to drop his sword and cloak, but Criston draws his sword, saying he will not suffer insults to the queen. Alicent orders him to sheath his sword, saying no insult was done. Shortly afterwards, Harrold resigns his post when he is ordered to go to Dragonstone and murder Rhaenyra's family, to the smug satisfaction of Criston.[11]
Later in the day, Criston is secretly ordered by Alicent to go into King's Landing, find Aegon, and bring him to her. Criston takes Aemond with him. They do not find him in the Street of Silk, which Aemond knows Aegon frequents. Afterwards, Aemond vents about how he should be king due to him putting in effort and doing his duty, to which Criston relates by saying that he has also had to toil for what others are freely given.[11]
The two happen to pick up the trail of Arryk and Erryk Cargyll, who have been secretly sent by Otto Hightower for the same purpose. They follow the two to the Grand Sept, where they find Aegon asleep underneath a shrine table. Criston stops Arryk from leaving with Aegon, and the two fight while Aemond grabs Aegon. Criston defeats Arryk, and then tells Aegon that "the queen awaits."[11]
Before Aegon's coronation, Criston is appointed Lord Commander of the Kingsguard by Alicent for his loyalty.[11]
In the Dragonpit, Criston crowns Aegon with the Conqueror's own crown, and hails him as the true heir to the Iron Throne. The coronation is interrupted when Rhaenys Targaryen bursts through the floor on her dragon Meleys. Alicent orders Criston to protect Queen Helaena, but Meleys only roars at them before she and Rhaenys fly away to warn Rhaenyra.[11]
Legacy
Some details about Criston's actions during the Dance of the Dragons are misremembered by history. Viserys Targaryen's recollection of the Green coup includes Criston himself summoning the Small Council in the hour of the owl to inform them of the king's death, and arguing that a son comes before a daughter. It is also said that Criston slit Lyman Beesbury's throat with a dagger when he protested. Munkun gives Criston the epithet "Kingmaker" in his book The Dance of Dragons, A True Telling.[1]
Personality
Criston is noble in demeanor, and an unrivaled warrior. He is proud of his status as a knight of the Kingsguard.[12] He is prone to sudden bursts of anger,[7][11] and sometimes stammers when he speaks.[7]

Behind the scenes
Criston Cole was revealed to be a recurring character in House of the Dragon on December 8, 2020. On April 15, 2021, HBO announced that Fabien Frankel had signed on for the series. The character breakdown reads as follows:
- "Of Dornish descent, Ser Criston is the common-born son of the steward to the Lord of Blackhaven. He has no claim to land or titles; all he has to his name is his honor and his preternatural skill with a sword."
- ―HBO
In the books
In Fire & Blood, Criston Cole was born the son of a steward to Lord Dondarrion of Blackhaven, in the Dornish Marches. He had coal black hair and pale green eyes: combined with his prowess as the greatest living warrior in Westeros, many ladies at court found him charming. The books make no mention that he had some Dornish ancestry, though it is theoretically possible: the Dornish Marches are the border area between the Stormlands, the Reach, and Dorne, and control of the region has frequently changed hands over the centuries.
There are two conflicting sources about the relationship between Ser Criston and Rhaenyra, though according to both they never slept together:
- According to Septon Eustace, after Viserys decided to wed Rhaenyra to Laenor Velaryon, Criston slipped into the princess's bedchamber, confessed his love for her, and begged her to elope with him across the narrow sea; Rhaenyra refused, reminding Criston that she was the blood of the dragon, and meant for more than to live out her life as the wife of a common sellsword. Eustace further posed the question "if he could set aside his Kingsguard vows, why would marriage vows mean any more to him?"
- According to Mushroom, it was Rhaenyra who went to Ser Criston, not the other way around. Twice she attempted to seduce him, using the "arts" she had learned from Daemon, but Criston was a man of honor and true to his vows, and would not be swayed.
However it happened, whether the princess spurned the knight or the other way around, since then the relationship between them went downhill. In a tournament held during the wedding celebrations of Laenor and Rhaenyra, Harwin Strong rode as Rhaenyra's champion. Ser Criston, furious that Rhaenyra bestowed her garter on Ser Harwin instead of him, took it out on the other competitors, resulting in the death of Joffrey Lonmouth.
