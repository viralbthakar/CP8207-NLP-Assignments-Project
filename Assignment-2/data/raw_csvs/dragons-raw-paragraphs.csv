0,"Caraxes[N 1] is a dragon ridden by Prince Daemon Targaryen. A veteran of many battles, he is known as the Blood Wyrm for his red scales.
"
1,"Biography
"
2,"Background
"
3,"Caraxes is ridden by Daemon Targaryen.[1] He has red scales, yellow eyes, a beard of horns, and wing-like membranes on his legs to support the aerodynamics of his body, which is long and serpentine in physique.
"
4,"House of the Dragon: Season 1
"
5,"After Daemon is banished from King's Landing by Viserys, he leaves on Caraxes with Mysaria.[2]
"
6,"During a confrontation between Daemon and Otto Hightower at Dragonstone, Caraxes shrieks and crawls forward to reveal himself at the top of a cliff, prompting Otto to order his men to sheathe their weapons.[3]
"
7,"Caraxes is used by Daemon during the War for the Stepstones. Despite the distinct advantage a powerful dragon gives in battle, his effectiveness was suppressed by the caves along the coast of Bloodstone, where Craghas Drahar and his soldiers retreated to. During one such night raid, Caraxes and Daemon ambush the Triarchy forces but can only cause minimal casualties when the Crabfeeder and his men hide from the dragonfire. Subsequently, numerous flaming arrows are fired at them, confusing Caraxes and wounding Daemon, forcing them to retreat.[4]
"
8,"Caraxes and Daemon fly over Rhaenyra Targaryen's ship during their return to King's Landing.[5]
"
9,"Caraxes flies alongside Vhagar in the skies above Pentos, during the self-exile of Daemon and his second wife Laena Velaryon.[6]
"
10,"Caraxes stays at High Tide along with several other dragons during the funeral of Laena Velaryon.[7]
"
11,"At Dragonstone, Daemon summons Caraxes to intimidate Kingsguard knights Ser Steffon Darklyn and Ser Lorent Marbrand and to remind them of their oaths.[8]
"
12,"Behind the scenes
"
13,"The visual design of Caraxes is inspired by a loong (Chinese dragon).[9]
"
14,"In the books
"
15,"In Fire & Blood, Caraxes was one of the older and larger dragons during the Dance of the Dragons. His scales were colored red, leading to him being called ""the Blood Wyrm"".
"
16,"Caraxes's first rider was Aemon Targaryen, the Prince of Dragonstone and King Jaehaerys I's eldest son. One of the fiercest dragons among the younger generation, he was given his nickname by the Dragonkeepers, the order of guards created by King Jaehaerys to guard the newly-completed Dragonpit, and later saw his first conflict during the Fourth Dornish War, when King Jaehaerys (astride Vermithor), Prince Aemon (astride Caraxes) and Prince Baelon, Aemon's younger brother (astride Vhagar), descended upon the Dornish fleet and destroyed it without suffering a single loss. Caraxes would later accompany Aemon to Tarth when an invasion of Myrish pirates caused the route of the Evenstar. However, Caraxes's fires drew the attention of the Myrish onto the Westerosi camp and a crossbowmen took a shot at the Evenstar, but missed and hit Aemon instead. The Prince of Dragonstone died of the wound, leaving Caraxes riderless until Daemon Targaryen, the younger son of Aemon's brother Baelon, claimed him.

"
43,"Syrax[N 1] is a dragon belonging to House Targaryen. She is the personal mount of Rhaenyra Targaryen.
"
44,"Biography
"
45,"Background
"
46,"Syrax is a yellow green-eyed dragon ridden by Rhaenyra Targaryen.[1] She is named after the Valyrian goddess Syrax.[2]
"
47,"House of the Dragon: Season 1
"
48,"Rhaenyra rides Syrax on a morning flight around King's Landing before their return to the entrance of the Dragonpit. As Rhaenyra departs for the Red Keep, the Dragonkeepers escort Syrax into the Dragonpit. Several days later, Rhaenyra commands Syrax to cremate the bodies of Queen Aemma Arryn and Prince Baelon Targaryen.[3]
"
49,"When Rhaenyra learns that her uncle Prince Daemon Targaryen stole the dragon egg that was meant for her brother Baelon, she rides Syrax to Dragonstone and successfully retrieves the egg without inflicting a single casualty before returning to King's Landing.[4]
"
50,"As a gesture of renewed friendship, Rhaenyra offers to give one of Syrax's eggs to Alicent's son Aemond.[5]
"
51,"Syrax stays at High Tide along with several other dragons during the funeral of Laena Velaryon.[6]
"
52,"Daemon enters Dragonmont to retrieve eggs laid by Syrax. He returns with three eggs in total.[7]
"
53,"Syrax is able to feel the pain of Rhaenyra when the latter miscarried her daughter Visenya. When Otto Hightower and his guards arrive on Dragonstone to demand Rhaenyra's, Rhaenyra rides Syrax to intimidate them before flying off.[8]
"
54,"In the books
"
55,"Syrax had yellow scales, and by the Dance of the Dragons she had grown huge and formidable - though not as fearsome or experienced in battle as Caraxes. While Rhaenyra enjoyed flying in her youth, as an adult she kept Syrax restrained on Dragonstone. By the time the civil war began she had not hunted for years, but was very well fed.
"
56,"Rhaenyra first took Syrax as a mount in 104 AC, when the princess was seven years old. Syrax was described as a ""young"" dragon at the time, and Rhaenyra herself named her ""Syrax"" (after a Valyrian goddess) - strongly implying that Syrax had no previous rider.
"
57,"Fire & Blood simply didn't state the lineage of the twenty Targaryen dragons alive at the beginning of the civil war, so it's unclear which ones were Syrax's parents. However, Rhaenyra's dragon is the only one specifically described as laying eggs: she laid ""several"" clutches during the reign of her father Viserys I. Syrax's latest clutch was produced just prior to the civil war, one of which was given to Daemon's daughter Rhaena.

"
81,"Meleys,[N 1] called the Red Queen, is a dragon of House Targaryen. She is the mount of Rhaenys Targaryen.
"
82,"Biography
"
83,"Background
"
84,"Meleys is ridden by Rhaenys Targaryen.[1] She has scarlet scales and a crown of bright copper horns. During her youth, she is said to have been faster than both Caraxes and Vhagar.[2]
"
85,"House of the Dragon: Season 1
"
86,"Rhaenys rides Meleys towards King's Landing. Her son Laenor Velaryon, who is to marry Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen, rides the dragon Seasmoke at her side.[3]
"
87,"Meleys stays at High Tide along with several other dragons during the funeral of Laena Velaryon.[4]
"
88,"Meleys is chained in the Dragonpit during the coronation of Aegon II Targaryen. She is eventually freed by Rhaenys and rides her out of the Dragonpit, inadvertently killing a number of smallfolk during their escape to Dragonstone.[5]
"
89,"After the coronation of Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen, Rhaenys and Meleys start to patrol the Gullet and reinforce Lord Corlys Velaryon's blockade of the shipping lanes to King's Landing.[6]
"
90,"In the books
"
91,"In the prequel novellas, Meleys was known as ""the Red Queen"", which seems to indicate that she was the mother of several of the other dragons (much as Rhaenys was grandmother to the youngest generation of dragon-riders). Her exact age and lineage has not yet been established.
"
92,"Meleys does appear to have been one of the oldest and largest dragons after Vhagar herself, and was probably one of the second generation dragons hatched to the original three from the Conquest-generation (Balerion, Meraxes, and Vhagar). Vhagar was 181 years old during the Dance, and by that point as said to have grown as large as Balerion had been during the War of Conquest. Vhagar is also described as being five times the size of the young dragon Arrax, who was only a decade or so old and only just big enough to ride to war.

"
115,"Vhagar,[N 1] known as the Queen of All Dragons, is the dragon who was ridden by Visenya Targaryen during the War of Conquest.[3][4] Although during this time she was the smallest of the trio that included Balerion and Meraxes, Vhagar was still large enough to swallow a horse whole, and her flames could melt armor.[5][6] A hundred years later, during the reign of Viserys I Targaryen, she is the largest of all known living dragons and the last remaining dragon from the days of Aegon's conquest.
"
116,"Biography
"
117,"Background
"
118,"Vhagar was flown by Aegon's sister-wife Visenya during the War of Conquest. She was one of the three dragons present at the Field of Fire, the decisive battle of the conquest that ensured Targaryen mastery of the Seven Kingdoms.
"
119,"Nonetheless, House Arryn thought that the Vale could still resist Targaryen domination by hiding behind the impregnable Mountains of the Moon along their borders, and fortifying the mountain passes beyond any hope of attack. Similar to how Aegon had dealt with Harrenhal, Visenya simply flew Vhagar directly over the mountains, and came to rest in the courtyard of the Arryn's own castle, the Eyrie. At the time, the King of Mountain and Vale was only a small boy, Ronnel Arryn, whose mother Sharra was acting as his regent. Visenya did not need to burn the Eyrie as Aegon had burned Harrenhal: her display of force with Vhagar and easily befriending Ronnel was enough to convince the Arryns to surrender. Young Ronnel did ask one condition for his surrender: in return, Visenya would give him a ride around the Eyrie atop her dragon. The Vale surrendered, and true to her word, Visenya gave Ronnel a ride atop Vhagar, flying around the summit of the Eyrie three times before they landed.[7]
"
120,"Following the death of Balerion sometime before the accession of Viserys I Targaryen to the Iron Throne, Vhagar remained the last of the three dragons who had come to Westeros with the Targaryens.[8] She eventually became the mount of Baelon Targaryen until his death.[9]
"
121,"House of the Dragon: Season 1
"
122,"Queen Aemma Arryn tells her husband, King Viserys, that their daughter Rhaenyra has picked a dragon egg that reminds her of Vhagar for her unborn sibling, who she hopes will be a girl named Visenya.[8]
"
123,"In conversation with Lady Laena Velaryon, Viserys tells her that Vhagar has not been seen for some time, but that the Dragonkeepers believed she had made her nest along the coast of the Narrow Sea. By this time, Vhagar's size was such that she was too large to remain in the Dragonpit. Laena says that traders in Spicetown on her native Driftmark claim to hear her song at times, and that it sounds sad. Viserys muses that even dragons can get lonely.[10]
"
124,"More than a decade later, Vhagar is the mount of Laena herself. Laena takes great pride in riding the largest known living dragon in the world, riding alongside her husband Daemon and his own dragon Caraxes. Sometime later, Laena suffers a difficult birth, with everyone believing the child must be cut out of her to survive. Unwilling to die in bed, she stumbles outside to find Vhagar, before giving the command ""Dracarys."" Vhagar hesitates, unwilling to burn her rider despite her repeated pained commands. Eventually, she complies and unleashes her dragonfire, incinerating Laena to prevent a more drawn out and painful death.[11]
"
125,"Days later, as she sleeps on the beach of High Tide, Vhagar is awakened by Aemond Targaryen, who desires to ride a dragon. She initially ignores his attempt to mount her and goes back to sleep, but when Aemond tries again, Vhagar nearly unleashes her dragonfire on him but is successfully commanded by Aemond in High Valyrian. Having now claimed and bonded with her, Aemond takes her for a first flight; though he nearly falls to his death having not properly fastened himself to the saddle, he is able to fly her around Driftmark. Later, during the royal family's return to King's Landing, Aemond rides Vhagar home.[12]
"
126,"Aemond rides Vhagar to Storm's End to treat with and gain the support of Lord Borros Baratheon for Aegon. She notices the arrival of Lucerys Velaryon and Arrax. After Lucerys and Arrax leave, Aemond pursues on Vhagar to scare him and take one of his eyes as revenge for losing his own shortly after he claimed Vhagar. After nearly snatching him several times, she loses track of Arrax when the small dragon flies into a ravine, far too narrow for her to follow. But Arrax, against Luke's wishes, turns around and blasts Vhagar with dragonflame. Enraged, Vhagar pursues, ignoring Aemond as he desperately tries to regain control of her. Above the storm, Vhagar catches Arrax in her mouth, even as Aemond commands her to stop her attack. Being about five times larger than the younger dragon, she easily rips him apart with a single bite, sending his and Lucerys's corpses plummeting to the ground below.[13]
"
127,"Game of Thrones: Season 1
"
128,"Viserys tells Doreah that Vhagar's skull decorated the Great Hall of the Red Keep prior to Robert's Rebellion.[3]
"
129,"Game of Thrones: Season 2
"
130,"While Arya is in the service of Tywin in Harrenhal, she mentions that Vhagar was one of the three dragons used in the War of Conquest, ridden by Visenya Targaryen.[4]
"

"
132,"While incarcerated and learning to read, Davos has trouble reading Vhagar's name.[6]
"

"
134,"Shireen is reading The Dance of Dragons, A True Telling and retells the story of Vhagar and Ser Byron Swann to Davos, which they share a laugh over.[14]
"
135,"Quotes
"
136,"Spoken about Vhagar
"
137,"- ""What that rogue Aemond has done, in winning Vhagar to our side. The boy was right. It's worth a thousand times the price he paid.""
"
138,"- ―Otto Hightower
"
139,"- ""Vhagar was five times the size of Arrax and the hardened survivor of a hundred battles.""
"
140,"- ―Robert Baratheon
"
141,"In the books
"
142,"Visenya continued to ride Vhagar to war during the Faith Militant uprising, burning out rebel castles in the Riverlands as once she had burned out castles in Dorne (even though Visenya was over 70 years old at the time). Visenya eventually died late in Maegor's reign: her riders during the next 60 or so years, if any, are unknown.
"
143,"Vhagar remained riderless for many years following Visenya's death, lairing first in the yards of Dragonstone and later in the Dragonpit of King's Landing. It was during the reign of King Jaehaerys I, when his and Good Queen Alysanne's children produced an abundance of Targaryens to claim the remaining dragons, that Vhagar finally gained a new rider in the King's second son, Prince Baelon. Baelon would ride Vhagar into battle during the Fourth Dornish War, alongside his father (astride Vermithor) and his elder brother Prince Aemon (astride Caraxes). Later, after Aemon was killed on Tarth by Myrish pirates, Baelon exacted a terrible vengeance for his beloved brother's death by unleashing Vhagar's fury on them. Baelon was made the Prince of Dragonstone and the Hand of the King for his exploits during the war on Tarth, but died several years later of a burst belly, leaving Vhagar riderless yet again. Later during the Old King's reign, Balerion died of old age, making Vhagar the oldest and largest of the Targaryen dragons.
"
144,"After Meraxes and then Balerion died, Vhagar was the last of the original three Targaryen dragons. Meraxes died fighting in Dorne, while Balerion later died of old age. Vhagar was the mother of several of the second-generation Targaryen dragons, but exactly which ones have not yet been specified
"
145,"Vhagar fought in more major Westerosi wars than any other Targaryen dragon: the War of Conquest, the Faith Militant uprising, and the Dance of the Dragons. Meraxes only fought in the War of Conquest. Balerion did fight in the Faith Militant uprising (ridden by Visenya's own son Maegor after Aegon died), but he died before the Dance of the Dragons - though Balerion did fight in previous wars outside of Westeros, such as the ""Century of Blood"" in the Free Cities.
"
146,"Despite being one of the more famous dragons in the story, mentioned since the first novel, Vhagar's coloration went unrevealed for 25 years. Of the three original Targaryen dragons, Balerion was stated to be black with red highlights, while Meraxes's color (silver) wasn't revealed until The World of Ice and Fire was published in 2014. This became a point of contention among fans, repeatedly pressing George R.R. Martin about it in Q&A, but he would only respond that he hadn't decided yet and kept putting it off. Vhagar's color was finally revealed in the official 2021 A Song of Ice and Fire calendar: artist Sam Hogg had to make an illustration of Vhagar, and asked for direct clarification from Martin's team, who responded that Vhagar was ""bronze, with greenish blue highlights, and green eyes"".[15]
"
147,"In homage to Vhagar, Daenerys Targaryen renames one of the ships Illyrio Mopatis sent her after her.
