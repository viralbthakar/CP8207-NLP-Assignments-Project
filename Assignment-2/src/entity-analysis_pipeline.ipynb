       "{'he maesters of the citadel who keep the histories of westeros have used aegon’s conquest as their touchstone for the past three hundred years. births  deaths  battles  and other events are dated': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'true scholars know that such dating is far from precise. aegon targaryen’s conquest of the seven kingdoms did not take place in a single day. more than two years passed between aegon’s landing and his oldtown coronation…and even then the conquest remained incomplete  since dorne remained unsubdued. sporadic attempts to bring the dornishmen into the realm continued all through king aegon’s reign and well into the reigns of his sons  making it impossible to fix a precise end date for the wars of conquest.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'even the start date is a matter of some misconception. many assume  wrongly  that the reign of king aegon i targaryen began on the day he landed at the mouth of the blackwater rush  beneath the three hills where the city of king’s landing would eventually stand. not so. the day of aegon’s landing was celebrated by the king and his descendants  but the conqueror actually dated the start of his reign from the day he was crowned and anointed in the starry sept of oldtown by the high septon of the faith. this coronation took place two years after aegon’s landing  well after all three of the major': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'battles of the wars of conquest had been fought and won. thus it can be seen that most of aegon’s actual conquering took place from 2–1 bc  before the conquest.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'the targaryens were of pure valyrian blood  dragonlords of ancient lineage. twelve years before the doom of valyria  114 bc   aenar targaryen sold his holdings in the freehold and the lands of the long summer  and moved with all his wives  wealth  slaves  dragons  siblings  kin  and children to dragonstone  a bleak island citadel beneath a smoking mountain in the narrow sea.': 'king',\n",
       " 'at its apex valyria was the greatest city in the known world  the center of civilization. within its shining walls  twoscore rival houses vied for power and glory in court and council  rising and falling in an endless  subtle  oft savage struggle for dominance. the targaryens were far from the most powerful of the dragonlords  and their rivals saw their flight to dragonstone as an act of surrender  as cowardice. but lord aenar’s maiden daughter daenys  known forever afterward as daenys the dreamer  had foreseen the destruction of valyria by fire. and when the doom came twelve years later  the targaryens were the only dragonlords to survive.': 'valyria',\n",
       " 'dragonstone had been the westernmost outpost of valyrian power for two centuries. its location athwart the gullet gave its lords a stranglehold on blackwater bay and enabled both the targaryens and their close allies  the velaryons of driftmark  a lesser house of valyrian descent  to fill their coffers off the passing trade. velaryon ships  along with those of another allied valyrian house  the celtigars of claw isle  dominated the middle reaches of the narrow sea  whilst the targaryens ruled the skies with their dragons.': 'driftmark',\n",
       " 'yet even so  for the best part of a hundred years after the doom of valyria  the rightly named century of blood   house targaryen looked east  not west  and took little interest in the affairs of westeros. gaemon targaryen  brother and husband to daenys the dreamer  followed aenar the exile as lord of dragonstone  and became known as gaemon the glorious. gaemon’s son aegon and his daughter elaena ruled together after his death. after them the lordship passed to their son maegon  his brother aerys  and aerys’s sons  aelyx  baelon  and daemion. the last of the three brothers was daemion  whose son aerion then succeeded to dragonstone.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'the aegon who would be known to history as aegon the conqueror': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'and aegon the dragon was born on dragonstone in 27 bc. he was the only son  and second child  of aerion  lord of dragonstone  and lady valaena of house velaryon  herself half targaryen on her mother’s side. aegon had two trueborn siblings  an elder sister  visenya  and a younger sister  rhaenys. it had long been the custom amongst the dragonlords of valyria to wed brother to sister  to keep the bloodlines pure  but aegon took both his sisters to bride. by tradition  he would have been expected to wed only his older sister  visenya  the inclusion of rhaenys as a second wife was unusual  though not without precedent. it was said by some that aegon wed visenya out of duty and rhaenys out of desire.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'all three siblings had shown themselves to be dragonlords before they wed. of the five dragons who had flown with aenar the exile from valyria  only one survived to aegon’s day  the great beast called balerion  the black dread. the dragons vhagar and meraxes were younger  hatched on dragonstone itself.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'a common myth  oft heard amongst the ignorant  claims that aegon targaryen had never set foot upon the soil of westeros until the day he set sail to conquer it  but this cannot be truth. years before that sailing  the painted table had been carved and decorated at lord aegon’s command  a massive slab of wood  some fifty feet long  carved in the shape of westeros  and painted to show all the woods and rivers and towns and castles of the seven kingdoms. plainly  aegon’s interest in westeros long predated the events that drove him to war. as well  there are reliable reports of aegon and his sister visenya visiting the citadel of oldtown in their youth  and hawking on the arbor as guests of lord redwyne. he may have visited lannisport as well  accounts differ.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'the westeros of aegon’s youth was divided into seven quarrelsome kingdoms  and there was hardly a time when two or three of these kingdoms were not at war with one another. the vast  cold  stony north was ruled by the starks of winterfell. in the deserts of dorne  the martell princes held sway. the gold rich westerlands were ruled by the lannisters of casterly rock  the fertile reach by the gardeners of highgarden. the vale  the fingers  and the mountains of the moon belonged to house arryn…but the most belligerent kings of aegon’s time were the two whose realms lay closest to dragonstone  harren the black and argilac the arrogant.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'from their great citadel  storm’s end  the storm kings of house durrandon had once ruled the eastern half of westeros  from cape wrath to the bay of crabs  but their powers had been dwindling for centuries. the kings of the reach had nibbled at their domains from the west  the dornishmen harassed them from the south  and harren the black and his ironmen had pushed them from the trident and the lands north of the blackwater rush. king argilac  last of the durrandon  had arrested this decline for a time  turning back a dornish invasion whilst still a boy  crossing the narrow sea to join the great alliance against the imperialist “tigers” of volantis  and slaying garse vii gardener  king of the reach  in the battle of summerfield twenty years later. but argilac had grown older  his famous mane of black hair had gone grey  and his prowess at arms had faded.': 'king',\n",
       " 'north of the blackwater  the riverlands were ruled by the bloody hand of harren the black of house hoare  king of the isles and the rivers. harren’s ironborn grandsire  harwyn hardhand  had taken the trident from argilac’s grandsire  arrec  whose own forebears had thrown down the last of the river kings centuries earlier. harren’s father had extended his domains east to duskendale and rosby. harren himself had devoted most of his long reign  close on forty years  to building a gigantic castle beside the gods eye  but with harrenhal at last nearing completion  the ironborn would soon be free to seek fresh conquests.': 'king',\n",
       " 'no king in westeros was more feared than black harren  whose cruelty had become legendary all through the seven kingdoms. and no king in westeros felt more threatened than argilac the storm king  last of the durrandon  an aging warrior whose only heir was his maiden daughter. thus it was that king argilac reached out to the targaryens on dragonstone  offering lord aegon his daughter in marriage  with all the lands east of the gods eye from the trident to the blackwater rush as her dowry.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'aegon targaryen spurned the storm king’s proposal. he had two wives  he pointed out  he did not need a third. and the dower lands being offered had belonged to harrenhal for more than a generation. they were not argilac’s to give. plainly  the aging storm king meant to establish the targaryens along the blackwater as a buffer between his own lands and those of harren the black.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'would take the dower lands being offered if argilac would also cede massey’s hook and the woods and plains from the blackwater south to the river wendwater and the headwaters of the mander. the pact would be sealed by the marriage of argilac’s daughter to orys baratheon  lord aegon’s childhood friend and champion.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'these terms argilac the arrogant rejected angrily. orys baratheon was a baseborn half brother to lord aegon  it was whispered  and the storm king would not dishonor his daughter by giving her hand to a bastard. the very suggestion enraged him. argilac had the hands of aegon’s envoy cut off and returned to him in a box. “these are the only hands your bastard shall have of me ” he wrote.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'aegon made no reply. instead he summoned his friends  bannermen  and principal allies to attend him on dragonstone. their numbers were small. the velaryons of driftmark were sworn to house targaryen  as were the celtigars of claw isle. from massey’s hook came lord bar emmon of sharp point and lord massey of stonedance  both sworn to storm’s end  but with closer ties to dragonstone. lord aegon and his sisters took counsel with them  and visited the castle sept to pray to the seven of westeros as well  though he had never before been accounted a pious man.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'on the seventh day  a cloud of ravens burst from the towers of dragonstone to bring lord aegon’s word to the seven kingdoms of westeros. to the seven kings they flew  to the citadel of oldtown  to lords both great and small. all carried the same message  from this day forth there would be but one king in westeros. those who bent the knee to aegon of house targaryen would keep their lands and titles. those who took up arms against him would be thrown down  humbled  and destroyed.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'accounts differ on how many swords set sail from dragonstone with aegon and his sisters. some say three thousand  others number them only in the hundreds. this modest targaryen host put ashore at the mouth of the blackwater rush  on the northern bank where three wooded hills rose above a small fishing village.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'in the days of the hundred kingdoms  many petty kings had claimed dominion over the river mouth  amongst them the darklyn kings of duskendale  the masseys of stonedance  and the river kings of old  be they mudds  fishers  brackens  blackwoods  or hooks. towers and forts had crowned the three hills at various times  only to be thrown': 'kingdom',\n",
       " 'aegon targaryen quickly threw up a log and earth palisade around the highest of the three hills  and dispatched his sisters to secure the submission of the nearest castles. rosby yielded to rhaenys and golden eyed meraxes without a fight. at stokeworth a few crossbowmen loosed bolts at visenya  until vhagar’s flames set the roofs of the castle keep ablaze. then they too submitted.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'the conquerors’ first true test came from lord darklyn of duskendale and lord mooton of maidenpool  who joined their power and marched south with three thousand men to drive the invaders back into the sea. aegon sent orys baratheon out to attack them on the march  whilst he descended on them from above with the black dread. both lords were slain in the one sided battle that followed  darklyn’s son and mooton’s brother thereafter yielded up their castles and swore their swords to house targaryen. at that time duskendale was the principal westerosi port on the narrow sea  and had grown fat and wealthy from the trade that passed through its harbor. visenya targaryen did not allow the town to be sacked  but she did not hesitate to claim its riches  greatly swelling the coffers of the conquerors.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'this perhaps would be an apt place to discuss the differing characters of aegon targaryen and his sisters and queens.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'visenya  eldest of the three siblings  was as much a warrior as aegon himself  as comfortable in ringmail as in silk. she carried the valyrian longsword dark sister  and was skilled in its use  having trained beside her brother since childhood. though possessed of the silver gold hair and purple eyes of valyria  hers was a harsh  austere beauty. even those who loved her best found visenya stern  serious  and unforgiving  some said that she played with poisons and dabbled in dark sorceries.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'spent more time on dragonback than her brother and sister combined  for above all things she loved to fly. she once was heard to say that before she died she meant to fly meraxes across the sunset sea to see what lay upon its western shores. whilst no one ever questioned visenya’s fidelity to her brother husband  rhaenys surrounded herself with comely young men  and  it was whispered  even entertained some in her bedchambers on the nights when aegon was with her elder sister. yet despite these rumors  observers at court could not fail to note that the king spent ten nights with rhaenys for every night with visenya.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'aegon targaryen himself  strangely  was as much an enigma to his contemporaries as to us. armed with the valyrian steel blade blackfyre  he was counted amongst the greatest warriors of his age  yet he took no pleasure in feats of arms  and never rode in tourney or melee. his mount was balerion the black dread  but he flew only to battle or to travel swiftly across land and sea. his commanding presence drew men to his banners  yet he had no close friends  save orys baratheon  the companion of his youth. women were drawn to him  but aegon remained ever faithful to his sisters. as king  he put great trust in his small council and his sisters  leaving much of the day  to day governance of the realm to them…yet did not hesitate to take command when he found it necessary. though he dealt harshly with rebels and traitors  he was open handed with former foes who bent the knee.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'this he showed for the first time at the aegonfort  the crude wood  and earth castle he had raised atop what would henceforth and forever be known as aegon’s high hill. having taken a dozen castles and secured the mouth of the blackwater rush on both sides of the river  he commanded the lords he had defeated to attend him. there they laid their swords at his feet  and aegon raised them up and confirmed them in their lands and titles. to his oldest supporters he gave new honors. daemon velaryon  lord of the tides  was made master of ships  in command of the royal fleet. triston massey  lord of stonedance  was named master of laws  crispian celtigar master of coin. and orys baratheon he proclaimed to be “my shield  my stalwart  my strong right hand.” thus baratheon is reckoned by the maesters the first king’s hand.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'valyria. when aegon’s knights unfurled his great silken battle standard  with a red three headed dragon breathing fire upon a black field  the lords took it for a sign that he was now truly one of them  a worthy high king for westeros. when queen visenya placed a valyrian steel circlet  studded with rubies  on her brother’s head and queen rhaenys hailed him as  “aegon  first of his name  king of all westeros  and shield of his people ” the dragons roared and the lords and knights sent up a cheer…but the smallfolk  the fishermen and fieldhands and goodwives  shouted loudest of all.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'the seven kings that aegon the dragon meant to uncrown were not cheering  however. in harrenhal and storm’s end  harren the black and argilac the arrogant had already called their banners. in the west  king mern of the reach rode the ocean road north to casterly rock to meet with king loren of house lannister. the princess of dorne dispatched a raven to dragonstone  offering to join aegon against argilac the storm king…but as an equal and ally  not a subject. another offer of alliance came from the boy king of the eyrie  ronnel arryn  whose mother asked for all the lands east of the green fork of the trident for the vale’s support against black harren. even in the north  king torrhen stark of winterfell sat with his lords bannermen and counselors late into the night  discussing what was to be done about this would be conqueror. the whole realm waited anxiously to see where aegon would move next.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'within days of his coronation  aegon’s armies were on the march again. the greater part of his host crossed the blackwater rush  making south for storm’s end under the command of orys baratheon. queen rhaenys accompanied him  astride meraxes of the golden eyes and silver scales. the targaryen fleet  under daemon velaryon  left blackwater bay and turned north  for gulltown and the vale. with': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'them went queen visenya and vhagar. the king himself marched northwest  to the gods eye and harrenhal  the gargantuan fortress that was the pride and obsession of king harren the black.': 'visenya',\n",
       " 'all three of the targaryen thrusts faced fierce opposition. lords errol  fell  and buckler  bannermen to storm’s end  surprised the advance elements of orys baratheon’s host as they were crossing the wendwater  cutting down more than a thousand men before fading back into the trees. a hastily assembled arryn fleet  augmented by a dozen braavosi warships  met and defeated the targaryen fleet in the waters off gulltown. amongst the dead was aegon’s admiral  daemon velaryon. aegon himself was attacked on the south shore of the gods eye  not once but twice. the battle of the reeds was a targaryen victory  but they suffered heavy losses at the wailing willows when two of king harren’s sons crossed the lake in longboats with muffled oars and fell upon their rear.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'in the end  though  aegon’s enemies had no answer for his dragons. the men of the vale sank a third of the targaryen ships and captured near as many  but when queen visenya descended upon them from the sky  their own ships burned. lords errol  fell  and buckler hid in their familiar forests until queen rhaenys unleashed meraxes and a wall of fire swept through the woods  turning the trees to torches. and the victors at the wailing willows  returning across the lake to harrenhal  were ill prepared when balerion fell upon them out of the morning sky. harren’s longboats burned. so did harren’s sons.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'aegon’s foes also found themselves plagued by other enemies. as argilac the arrogant gathered his swords at storm’s end  pirates from the stepstones descended on the shores of cape wrath to take advantage of their absence  and dornish raiding parties came boiling out of the red mountains to sweep across the marches. in the vale  young king ronnel had to contend with a rebellion on the three sisters  when the sistermen renounced all allegiance to the eyrie and proclaimed lady marla sunderland their queen.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'for gold. so now the riverlands rose against him  led by lord edmyn tully of riverrun. summoned to the defense of harrenhal  tully declared for house targaryen instead  raised the dragon banner over his castle  and rode forth with his knights and archers to join his strength to aegon’s. his defiance gave heart to the other riverlords. one by one  the lords of the trident renounced harren and declared for aegon the dragon. blackwoods  mallisters  vances  brackens  pipers  freys  strongs…summoning their levies  they descended on harrenhal.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'suddenly outnumbered  king harren the black took refuge in his supposedly impregnable stronghold. the largest castle ever raised in westeros  harrenhal boasted five gargantuan towers  an inexhaustible source of fresh water  huge subterranean vaults well stocked with provisions  and massive walls of black stone higher than any ladder and too thick to be broken by any ram or shattered by a trebuchet. harren barred his gates and settled down with his remaining sons and supporters to withstand a siege.': 'king',\n",
       " 'aegon of dragonstone was of a different mind. once he had joined his power with that of edmyn tully and the other riverlords to ring the castle  he sent a maester to the gates under a peace banner  to parley. harren emerged to meet him  an old man and grey  yet still fierce in his black armor. each king had his banner bearer and his maester in attendance  so the words that they exchanged are still remembered.': 'aegon',\n",
       " '“yield now ” aegon began  “and you may remain as lord of the iron islands. yield now  and your sons will live to rule after you. i have eight thousand men outside your walls.”': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'to which aegon said  “when the sun sets  your line shall end.”': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'as the last light of the sun faded  black harren’s men stared into the gathering darkness  clutching their spears and crossbows. when no dragon appeared  some may have thought that aegon’s threats had been hollow. but aegon targaryen took balerion up high  through the clouds  up and up until the dragon was no bigger than a fly upon the moon. only then did he descend  well inside the castle walls. on wings as black as pitch balerion plunged through the night  and when the great towers of harrenhal appeared beneath him  the dragon roared his fury and bathed them in black fire  shot through with swirls of red.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'stone does not burn  harren had boasted  but his castle was not made of stone alone. wood and wool  hemp and straw  bread and salted beef and grain  all took fire. nor were harren’s ironmen made of stone. smoking  screaming  shrouded in flames  they ran across the yards and tumbled from the wallwalks to die upon the ground below. and even stone will crack and melt if a fire is hot enough. the riverlords outside the castle walls said later that the towers of harrenhal glowed red against the night  like five great candles…and like candles  they began to twist and melt as runnels of molten stone ran down their sides.': 'king',\n",
       " 'harren and his last sons died in the fires that engulfed his monstrous fortress that night. house hoare died with him  and so too did the iron islands’ hold on the riverlands. the next day  outside the smoking ruins of harrenhal  king aegon accepted an oath of fealty from edmyn tully  lord of riverrun  and named him lord paramount of the trident. the other riverlords did homage as well  to aegon as king and to edmyn tully as their liege lord. when the ashes had cooled enough to allow men to enter the castle safely  the swords of the fallen  many shattered or melted or twisted into ribbons of steel by dragonfire  were gathered up and sent back to the aegonfort in wagons.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'south and east  the storm king’s bannermen proved considerably more loyal than king harren’s. argilac the arrogant gathered a great host about him at storm’s end. the seat of the durrandons was a mighty fastness  its great curtain wall even thicker than the walls of': 'king',\n",

       " 'queen alysanne took great pride in arranging marriages  and had put together hundreds of fruitful unions for lords and ladies from one end of the realm to another  but never had she faced so much difficulty as she did whilst searching for mates for her four younger children. the struggle would torment her for years  bring about no end of conflict between her and the children  her daughters in particular   drive her and the king apart  and in the end bring her so much grief and pain that for a time her grace contemplated renouncing her marriage to spend the rest of her life with the silent sisters.': 'king',\n",
       " 'the frustrations started with vaegon and daella. only a year apart in age  the prince and princess seemed well matched as babes  and the king and queen assumed that the two of them would eventually marry. their older siblings baelon and alyssa had become inseparable  and plans were already being made for them to wed. why not vaegon and daella as well  “be sweet to your little sister ” king jaehaerys told the prince when he was five. “one day she will be your alysanne.”': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'as the children grew  however  it became apparent that the two of them were not ideally suited. there was no warmth between them  as the queen saw plainly. vaegon tolerated his sister’s presence  but never sought it out. daella seemed frightened of her sour  bookish brother  who would sooner read than play. the prince thought the princess stupid  she thought him mean. “they are only children ” jaehaerys said when alysanne brought the problem to his attention. “they will warm to one another in time.” they never did. if anything  their': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'the matter came to a head in 73 ac. prince vaegon was ten years old and princess daella nine when one of the queen’s companions  new to the red keep  teasingly asked the two of them when they would be married. vaegon reacted as if he had been slapped. “i would never marry her ” the boy said  in front of half the court. “she can barely read. she should find some lord in need of stupid children  for that’s the only sort he will ever have of her.”': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'princess daella  as might be expected  burst into tears and fled the hall  with her mother  the queen  rushing after her. it fell to her sister alyssa  at thirteen three years vaegon’s elder  to pour a flagon of wine over his head. even that did not make the prince repent. “you are wasting arbor gold ” was all he said before stalking from the hall to change his clothing.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'plainly  the king and queen concluded afterward  some other bride must needs be found for vaegon. briefly  they considered their younger daughters. princess saera was six years old in 73 ac  princess viserra only two. “vaegon has never looked twice at either one of them ” alysanne told the king. “i am not sure he is aware that they exist. perhaps if some maester wrote about them in a book…”': 'aegon',\n",
       " '“i shall tell grand maester elysar to commence tomorrow ” the king japed. then he said  “he is only ten. he does not see girls  no more than they see him  but that will change soon. he is comely enough  and a prince of westeros  third in line to the iron throne. in a few more years maidens will be fluttering around him like butterflies and blushing if he deigns to look their way.”': 'maester',\n",
       " 'the queen was unconvinced. comely was perhaps too generous a word for prince vaegon  who had the silver gold hair and purple eyes of the targaryens  but was long of face and round of shoulder even at ten  with a pinched sour cast to his mouth that made men suspect he had recently been sucking on a lemon. as his mother  her grace was mayhaps blind to these flaws  but not to his nature. “i fear for any butterfly that comes fluttering round vaegon. he is like to squash it flat beneath a book.”': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'grand maester elysar tells me that his grace did indeed speak to prince baelon  who dutifully took his brother under his wing  marched him out into the yard  put a sword into his hand and a shield upon his arm. it did not set him right. vaegon hated it. he was a miserable fighter  and he had a gift for making everyone around him miserable as well  even baelon the brave.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'baelon persisted for a year  at the king’s insistence. “the more he drills  the worse he looks ” the spring prince confessed. one day  mayhaps in an attempt to spur vaegon into making more of an effort  he brought his sister alyssa to the yard  shining in man’s mail. the princess had not forgotten the incident of the arbor gold. laughing and shouting mockery  she danced around her little brother and humiliated him half a hundred times  whilst princess daella looked down from a window. shamed beyond endurance  vaegon threw down his sword and ran from the yard  never to return.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'we shall return to prince vaegon  and his sister daella  in due course  but let us turn now to a joyful event. in 74 ac  king jaehaerys and queen alysanne were blessed again by the gods when prince aemon’s wife  the lady jocelyn  presented them with their first grandchild. princess rhaenys was born on the seventh day of the seventh moon of the year  which the septons judged to be highly auspicious. large and fierce  she had the black hair of her baratheon mother and the pale violet eyes of her targaryen father. as the firstborn child of the prince of dragonstone  many hailed her as next in line for the iron throne after her father. when queen alysanne held her in her arms for the first time  she was heard to call the little girl “our queen to be.”': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'in breeding  as in so much else  baelon the brave was not far behind his brother aemon. in 75 ac  the red keep was the site of another splendid wedding  as the spring prince took to bride the eldest of his sisters  princess alyssa. the bride was fifteen  the groom eighteen. unlike their father and mother  baelon and alyssa did not wait to consummate their union  the bedding that followed their wedding feast was the source of much ribald humor in the days that followed  for the young bride’s sounds of pleasure could be heard all the way to duskendale  men said. a shyer maid might have been abashed by that  but alyssa targaryen was as bawdy a wench as any barmaid in king’s landing  as she herself was fond of boasting. “i mounted him and took him for a ride ” she declared the morning after the bedding  “and i': 'king',\n",
       " 'meanwhile  the problem of their brother vaegon persisted  to the queen’s frustration. the king had not been entirely wrong about the butterflies. as the years passed and vaegon matured  young ladies at the court began to pay him some attention. age  and some uncomfortable discussions with his father and his brothers  had taught the prince the rudiments of courtesy  and he did not squash any of the girls  to the queen’s relief. but he took no special notice of any of them either. books remained his only passion  history  cartography  mathematics  languages. grand maester elysar  never a slave to propriety  confessed to having given the prince a volume of erotic drawings  thinking mayhaps that pictures of naked maidens comporting with men and beasts and one another might kindle vaegon’s interest in the charms of women. the prince kept the book  but showed no change in behavior.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'it was on prince vaegon’s fifteenth nameday in 78 ac  a year short of his manhood  that jaehaerys and alysanne broached the obvious solution to the grand maester. “do you think mayhaps vaegon might have the makings of a maester ”': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'keep a raven in his chamber  or any sort of bird  can you imagine him removing a man’s crushed leg  or delivering a baby  all these are required of a maester.” the grand maester paused  then said  “vaegon is no maester…but he could well have the makings of an archmaester in him. the citadel is the greatest repository of knowledge in the known world. send him there. mayhaps he will find himself in the library. that  or he’ll get so lost amongst the books that you never need to concern yourselves with him again.”': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'his words struck home. three days later  king jaehaerys summoned prince vaegon to his solar to tell him that he would be taking ship for oldtown in a fortnight. “the citadel will take charge of you ” his grace said. “it is for you to determine what becomes of you.” the prince responded curtly  as was his wont. “yes  father. good.” afterward jaehaerys told the queen that he thought vaegon had almost smiled.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'prince baelon had not ceased smiling since his marriage. when not aloft  baelon and alyssa spent every hour together  most oft in their bedchamber. prince baelon was a lusty lad  for those same shrieks of pleasure that had echoed through the halls of the red keep on the night of their bedding were heard many another night in the years that followed. and soon enough  the much hoped for result appeared  and alyssa targaryen grew great with child. in 77 ac she gave her brave prince a son they named viserys. septon barth described the boy as a “plump and pleasant lad  who laughed more than any babe i’ve ever known  and nursed so lustily he drank his wet nurse dry.” against all advice  his mother clapped the boy in swaddling clothes  strapped him to her chest  and took him aloft on meleys when he was nine days old. afterward she claimed viserys giggled the whole while.': 'septon',\n",
       " 'bearing and delivering a child may be a joy for a young woman of ten and seven  like the princess alyssa  but it is quite another matter for one of forty  like her mother  queen alysanne. the joy was therefore not entirely unalloyed when her grace was found to be pregnant once again. prince valerion was born in 77 ac  after another troubled labor that saw alysanne confined to her bed for half a year. like his brother gaemon four years earlier  he was a small and sickly babe  and never thrived. half a dozen wet nurses came and went to no avail. in 78 ac  valerion died  a fortnight short of his first nameday. the queen took his passing with resignation. “i am forty two years old ” she told the king. “you must be content with the children i have given you. i am more suited to be a grandmother than a mother now  i': 'king',\n",
       " 'king jaehaerys did not share her certainty. “our mother  queen alyssa  was forty six when she gave birth to jocelyn ” he pointed out to grand maester elysar. “the gods may not be done with us.”': 'maester',\n",
       " 'he was not wrong. the very next year  the grand maester informed queen alysanne that she was once more with child  to her surprise and dismay. princess gael was born in 80 ac  when the queen was forty  four. called “the winter child” for the season of her birth  and because the queen was in the winter of her childbearing years  some said   she was small  pale  and frail  but grand maester elysar was determined that she would not suffer the fate of her brothers gaemon and valerian. nor did she. assisted by septa lyra  who watched over the babe night and day  elysar nursed the princess through a difficult first year  until finally it seemed as if she might survive. when she reached her first nameday  still healthy if not strong  queen alysanne thanked the gods.': 'maester',\n",
       " 'she was thankful as well that year to have finally arranged a marriage for her eighthborn child  the princess daella. with vaegon settled  daella had been next in line  but the tearful princess presented an entirely different sort of problem. “my little flower ” was how the queen described her. like alysanne herself  daella was small—on her toes  she stood five feet two inches—and there was a childish aspect to her that led everyone who met her to think she was younger than her age. unlike alysanne  she was delicate as well  in ways the queen had never been. her mother had been fearless  daella always seemed to be afraid. she had a kitten that she loved until he scratched her  then she would not go near a cat. the dragons terrified her  even silverwing. the mildest scolding would reduce her to tears. once  in the halls of the red keep  daella had encountered a prince from the summer isles in his feathered cloak  and squealed in terror. his black skin had made her take him for a demon.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'cruel though her brother vaegon’s words had been  there was some truth to them. daella was not clever  even her septa had to admit. she learned to read after a fashion  but haltingly  and without full comprehension. she could not seem to commit even the simplest prayers to memory. she had a sweet voice  but was afraid to sing  she always got the words wrong. she loved flowers  but was frightened of gardens  a bee had almost stung her once.': 'aegon',\n",
       " 'in the years that followed her first flowering  daella targaryen drew the eye of many a young lordling  as expected. she was a king’s daughter  and maidenhood had only made her prettier. her mother was at work as well  arranging matters in every way she could to place suitable marriage prospects before the princess.': 'king',\n",
       " 'at thirteen daella was sent to driftmark to meet corlys velaryon  the grandson to the lord of the tides. ten years her elder  the future sea snake was already a celebrated mariner and captain of ships. daella became seasick crossing blackwater bay  however  and on her return complained that “he likes his boats better than he likes me.”  she was not wrong in that.

       " 'her sixteenth nameday was fast approaching  and with it her womanhood. queen alysanne was at her wit’s end  and the king had lost his patience. on the first day of the 80th year since aegon’s': 'aegon',\n",
       " '“a hundred naked ducks would frighten her ” the king replied.': 'king',\n",
       " 'in the end it did not require a hundred men  naked or clothed. the queen explained the king’s command to daella gently but firmly  and offered her a choice of three suitors  each of whom was eager for her hand. pate the pig boy was not amongst them  it should be said  the three men that alysanne had selected were great lords or the sons of great lords. whichever man she married  daella would have wealth and position.': 'king',\n",
       " 'last of the three  and least in many eyes  was rodrik arryn  lord of the eyrie and protector of the vale. he had been a lord since the age of ten  a point in his favor  for the past twenty years he had served on the small council as lord justiciar and master of laws  during which time he had become a familiar figure about court  and a leal friend to both king and queen. in the vale he had been an able lord  strong but just  affable  open handed  loved by the smallfolk and his lords bannermen alike. in addition  he had acquitted himself well in king’s landing  sensible  knowledgeable  good humored  he was regarded as a great asset to the council.': 'king',\n",
       " 'to the astonishment of every woman at the court  save mayhaps the queen  princess daella chose lord rodrik to be her husband. “he seems good and wise  like father ” she told queen alysanne  “and he has four children  i’m to be their new mother ” what her grace thought of that outburst is not recorded. grand maester elysar’s account of the day says only  “gods be good.”': 'maester',\n",
       " 'theirs would not be a long betrothal. as the king had wished  princess daella and lord rodrik were wed before year’s end. it was a small ceremony in the sept at dragonstone  attended only by close friends and kin  larger crowds made the princess desperately uncomfortable. nor was there a bedding. “oh  i could not bear that  i should die of shame ” the princess had told her husband to be  and lord rodrik had acceded to her wishes.': 'king',\n",
       " 'and so she was  for a time. the eldest of lord rodrik’s four children from his first wife was a daughter  elys  three years older than her new stepmother. the two of them clashed from the first. daella doted on the three younger children  however  and they seemed to adore her in turn. lord rodrik  true to his word  was a kind and caring husband who never failed to pamper and protect the bride he called “my precious princess.” such letters as daella sent her mother  letters largely written for her by lord rodrik’s younger daughter  amanda  spoke glowingly of how happy she was  how beautiful the vale  how much she loved her lord’s sweet sons  how everyone in the eyrie was so kind to her.': 'amanda',\n",
       " 'prince aemon reached his twenty sixth nameday in 81 ac  and had proved himself more than able in both war and peace. as the heir apparent to the iron throne  it was felt desirable that he take a greater role in the governance of the realm as a member of the king’s council. accordingly  king jaehaerys named the prince his justiciar and master of laws in place of rodrik arryn.': 'king',\n",
